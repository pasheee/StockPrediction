39371,2018-07-05 17:23:20,Senior Loan ETF an Attractive Option in Rising Rate Environment,"This article was originally published onETFTrends.com.
In today's current economic climate, SPDR Blackstone/GSO Senior Loan Portfolio (SRLN) is an attractive option, particularly if the Federal Reserve remains hawkish on any forthcoming data that may signal the inclusion of more interest rate hikes.
All assets under the fund are funneled into the Blackstone / GSO Senior Loan Portfolio, and SRLN's main objective is to outperform a primary and secondary index--the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid Leveraged Loan Index and the S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index through its investment in senior loans.
Floating Rate Component
In the last six months, the Federal Reserve has been stepping up its interest rate hikes--fueled by a growing economy that is seeing low unemployment levels and rising inflation.
As such, SRLN takes advantage of any short-term rate hikes with its floating rate component, allowing the yields in the loan portfolio to move in conjunction with interest rates. This provides for a hedge against interest-rate risk versus a fixed rate loan portfolio and maximizes return simultaneously.

Selective Underwriting
SRLN primarily invests in senior loans given to businesses operating in North America, but loans may also originate from businesses operating outside of North America. The Portfolio may invest in senior loans through the loans directly via the primary or secondary market or via participations in senior loans, which are contractual relationships with an existing lender in a loan facility where the loan portfolio purchases the right to receive principal and interest payments.
SRLN seeks to construct a portfolio of loans that are less volatile than the general loan market. In order to maximize loan portfolio performance, SRLN adds or removes loans that it believes will cause the portfolio to outperform or underperform versus the primary and secondary indexes.
The selective loan portfolio must include companies that meet the following criteria:
• Leading, defensible market positions: SRLN intends to invest in companies that it believes have developed strong positions within their respective markets and exhibit the potential to maintain sufficient cash flows and profitability to service their obligations in a range of economic environments.
• Investing in companies with positive cash flow: SRLN intends to invest primarily in established companies which have demonstrated a record of profitability and cash flows over several economic cycles.
• Proven management teams: SRLN intends to focus on investments in which the target company has an experienced management team with an established track record of success.
• Private equity sponsorship: SRLN will seek to participate in transactions sponsored by what it believes to be high-quality private equity firms.
• Diversification, concentration and reliance on other lenders: SRLN will seek to invest broadly among companies and industries, thereby potentially reducing the risk of a downturn in any one company or industry having a disproportionate impact on the portfolio.
Senior Loan Priority During Default
The inclusion of senior loans in SRLN's portfolio gives these particular loans first lien priority, meaning in the event of a borrower default, the senior loans are paid first. Higher payment priority assists liquidity in terms of the defaulting borrower having to sell assets in order to pay off creditors--in this case, senior loans within the SRLN portfolio are given higher priority--a viable option especially during a market downturn.

Strong Performance
SRLN has seen positive returns given their total returns year-to-date, the past year and the last three years.
• Year-to-date: Up 1.62 percent
• 1-year: Up 3.48 percent
• 3-year: Up 2.62 percent

88471,2024-02-20 13:19:00,4 Stocks to Watch as Bitcoin Regains $1 Trillion Market Cap,"The cryptocurrency rally has resumed after a two-week pause, with Bitcoin (BTC) regaining its $1 trillion market cap for the first time since December 2021. Bitcoin breached the $52,000 mark on Feb 15 and has since then held on to it. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency has gained more than 25% this year after a solid 2023.
There are several reasons behind Bitcoin’s recent rally. However, the biggest factor has been the January approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. In one of the most important events in the history of Bitcoin, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in a major reform, approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early January.
The crypto rally gained momentum in the final months of 2023 on expectations that the SEC would give a green signal anytime. The cryptocurrency declined sharply in the last weeks of January, falling as much as $39,000. However, the positive sentiment is back.
The spot Bitcoin ETF approval was given with the aim to push cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance, which would give a long-term boost to the cryptocurrency space.
In a significant development, data from CryptoQuant indicates that spot Bitcoin ETFs have garnered $10 billion in assets under management (AUM) since their launch on Jan 10, reflecting the growing investor interest.
Besides, Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event is expected in April, which is likely to halve the mining reward for new blocks. Historically, this event has heightened scarcity, creating challenges for miners to acquire net Bitcoins. As a result, there tends to be an increase in Bitcoin's value due to the constrained supply.
NVIDIA CorporationNVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence, and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.
NVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 269.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.4% over the last 60 days. Currently, NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

11647,2019-07-05 17:35:06,How a company is screening public spaces without exposing sensitive details,"The summer vacation season means lots of travel — and long lines at airport security checkpoints and other events.
However, people being screened sometimes fear that, in airports and other public spaces, theirintimate body detailsare being exposed by advanced technology.
U.K.-based Thruvision, whose screening technology wasrecently contracted by the State Departmenthas deployed 200 of its people screening technologies at major transportation hubs worldwide.
That includes Los Angeles World Airports which manages LAX and LA Metro airports. Earlier this year, Thruvision was asked by the TSA to update its full-body scanning technology to address certain privacy concerns,according to The L.A. Times.
Yet Kevin Gramer, Americas vice president of Thruvision insisted on “YFi PM” that the company’s technology safeguards travelers’ privacy.
“As technology evolves to address the evolving threat, our technology is a safe and effective people screening technology,” Gramer said
“We maintain a safe and respectful piece on that so we’re not seeing any anatomical details,” he added— even as the tech is able to pick up potential weapons.
Thruvision’s screening units can be fixed at various locations, depending on the environment.
“We can deploy them on the ceiling, on the walls, in tactical deployment system, so they’re very flexible from a deployment standpoint,” Gramer said.
That may alarm some over privacy concerns, but Gramer insisted the onus is on the user. In public spaces, venues are required to disclose monitoring technologies.
“Our technology is agnostic to the event,” Gramer said.
The people screener uses passive terahertz (THz) technology that measures energy from the body, and the items that blocks that energy shows up on the scan.
It not only detects metal objects, it can also pick up non-metallic threats, such as 3D printed guns and explosives, from up to 25 feet away. The tech can be fixed at a covert location.
“We look at powders, plastics, liquids, gels, ceramics, all the items a metal detector would not normally catch,” Gramer said.

• Aligned aims use the funding to grow its core products for Ethereum-compatible blockchains like layer-2 networks
• Web 3 infrastructure provider aims to the Amazon Web Services of web3
Web 3 infrastructure provider, Aligned Capital, has secured $34 million in a funding round, the company announced on Thursday.
Founded by the former Chief Strategy Officer of ConsenSys, Sam Cassatt, the Web 3 infrastructure provider has emerged from stealth with a $34 million funding round at an undisclosed valuation.
Several investors have backed the funding, including GSR, Altium Capital, Cavalry Fund, and Ninja4.
As per reports, there was no lead investor. Angel investors included ConsenSys alum and Darma Capital founder Andrew Keys, Gryphon Digital Mining executive Chris Ensey, entrepreneur Steve Wiggins, former ConsenSys, and PayPal employee Ron Patiro. The funding round was primarily used to expand Aligned Capital’s high-performance computing footprint.
This equity funding round was aimed to help Aligned expand its web3 infrastructure. Aligned currently offers computing hardware for mining cryptocurrencies such asEthereum (ETH)and other activities. Interestingly, Aligned eventually hopes to become theAmazon Web Servicesfor web3.

The 4th Industrial Revolution Commission under the Presidential Office says the likes of Bitcoin derivatives should be instrumental as part of a medium- and long-term strategy to integrate cryptocurrencies into the economy. Business Korea reports the commission has advised the South Korean government to allow financial companies to release futures products based on Bitcoin prices , similar to the US. The commission also proposed allowing financial institutions to handle crypto-assets and support the development of custody technology. Participants in the traditional capital market such as securities firms and banks should develop and introduce domestic custody solutions to handle crypto assets so that the Korean crypto-asset custody market will not depend on foreign countries, the commission added. The Korean government has to gradually allow institutional investors to deal in crypto-assets and promote over-the-counter (OTC) desks dedicated to institutional investors trade. South Korea South Korean officials appear to be pivoting towards greater crypto freedom Officials announced last month that South Korea will not tax earnings from cryptocurrency trading  but might in the future.

45538,2021-04-26 01:53:20,Global stocks gain on optimism over economic recovery,"By Matt Scuffham and Tommy Wilkes
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Global stock markets made moderate gains on Monday as increasing confidence about the rapid recovery of economies from the COVID-19 pandemic offset concerns about the speed of the market's rally.
The start to the week was quiet as investors refrained from taking on large positions before a two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve that will begin on Tuesday and the impending release of U.S. quarterly gross domestic product data.
Investors have been ebullient in recent weeks, with Wall Street hitting another intraday record high on Friday and European shares not far off their own record highs.
In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 64.86 points, or 0.19%, to 34,108.35, the S&P 500 gained 12.33 points, or 0.29%, to 4,192.5 and the Nasdaq Composite added 51.01 points, or 0.36%, to 14,067.81.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.32% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.39%.
Asian shares rallied. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.58% higher, while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.36%.
That MSCI's helped gauge of stocks across the globe, which gained 0.39%.
Stocks - as well as most other risk assets - have ridden a massive rally. The MSCI world index has registered only three down months in the past 12 and is up nearly 5% this month and 9% for the year as investors bet on a rapid post-pandemic economic rebound turbocharged by vast government and central bank stimulus.
Analysts, however, say stocks look a little over-valued and that the rally will run into hurdles after setting such a lightning pace and with so much of the economic recovery and fiscal stimulus splurge already priced in.
""The real crux of the issue, however, is 'What's in the price?' The year-to-date rally has increasingly eliminated upside to our targets,"" noted Andrew Sheets, a strategist at Morgan Stanley.
""Across four major global equity markets (the U.S., Europe, Japan and emerging markets), only Japan is currently below our end-2021 strategy forecast.""
BOLSTER CONFIDENCE
Still, recent data pointing to a solid global economic recovery has bolstered confidence and limited any investor nervousness, as have strong corporate earnings and the continued rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations in developed economies.
Early April manufacturing activity indicators last week pointed to a robust start to the second quarter, with data hitting record highs in the United States and signaling an end to Europe's double-dip recession.
First-quarter U.S. gross domestic product data due later this week is likely to show activity returned to pre-pandemic levels, analysts said.
Most observers expect the Fed will stick to its pledge to keep stimulus flowing until the economy has recovered sufficiently and downplay the threat of rising inflation - any suggestion otherwise could hit market confidence sharply.
""The equity market is happy that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue with no new guidance on eventual tightening of policy as it wants to react to outcomes rather than anticipating them and believes that any inflationary rise in coming months will prove transitory,"" said Steen Jakobsen, chief investment officer at Saxo Bank.
In currencies, the dollar - which had benefited from rising Treasury yields the past few months - fell 0.003%, with the euro down 0.22% to $1.2072. Other major currencies were little changed.
Bitcoin snapped a five-day losing streak with a 6.2% jump. Cryptocurrencies fell on Friday on concern that U.S. President Joe Biden's plan to raise capital gains taxes would curb investments in digital assets.
Those tax proposals, while raising hackles among some investors, caused only a temporary blip in stock markets' march higher.
Government bond yields rose as investors dumped safer assets.
Yields on U.S. Treasury benchmark 10-year notes last rose 3/32 in price to yield 1.5579%, from 1.567% late on Friday.
Turkey's lira rebounded 1.3% following its recent slide but remains close to an all-time low as a chill settled on relations with the United States and after the new central bank chief signaled rate hikes would harm the economy.
In commodities, U.S. crude recently fell 1.42% to $61.26 per barrel and Brent was at $65.10, down 1.53% on the day.
Spot gold added 0.1% to $1,778.99 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.25% to $1,772.50 an ounce.

95013,2024-09-30 12:42:00,This Cryptocurrency Could Be a Major Player by 2030,"Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC)continues to reign as the world's top cryptocurrency, and it's not close. With a massive market cap of $1.3 trillion, Bitcoin is nearly four times larger than its next closest rival,Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH). In fact, Bitcoin now accounts for a whopping 57% of the market cap of the entire crypto market.
But a number of challengers are gaining on it, and the one that has the most upside potential over the next five years isSolana(CRYPTO: SOL). It currently ranks as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with its nearly $75 billion market cap, and it could be poised for a major run over the next five years.
Solanais the primary blockchain competitor toEthereum, which is currently the premier Layer 1 blockchain network in the world. As a result of rapid growth over the past few years, Solana now poses a serious challenge to Ethereum. In fact, many have dubbed Solana the ""Ethereum killer"" for its potential.
In large part, that has to do with Solana's superior performance. In terms of just about every important performance metric, Solana is head and shoulders above the competition. For example, Solana can process nearly 65,000 transactions per second. In comparison, Ethereum can handle only 30 transactions per second. In order to compensate for this deficiency, Ethereum uses a complex (and sometimes confusing) mix of blockchain scaling networks known as Layer 2 blockchains.
Top institutional investors are already starting to sit up and take notice. For example, in November 2023, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest extolled the virtues of Solana, noting that it has the potential to replace Ethereum one day as a result of being so much faster and more cost-effective. Over the next five years, the performance gap could widen even further, making Solana even more attractive to users, developers, and investors.
Case in point: Solana recently showcased a new blockchain innovation known as Firedancer that will theoretically enable it to process 1 million transactions per second. Ethereum has been talking about hitting this milestone for several years now, but it has never come anywhere close.
With its Solana Mobile initiative, which launched in June 2022, Solana has been laying the groundwork for even more growth over the next five years. Solana now offers two Web3 mobile devices -- the Saga and the Seeker -- that have been optimized for blockchain and crypto. These mobile devices promise to make the crypto user experience faster, better, and more streamlined.
Yes, right now, the audience for these mobile devices is limited. They appeal primarily to crypto enthusiasts, who use them to trade non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or swap meme coins. So Solana needs to come up with a ""killer app"" for these mobile devices that appeals to the average person.
If it can do this, Solana could see a huge boost in monthly active users. In fact, investment firm VanEck thinks that Solana might become the first blockchain to have a mobile app with over 100 million users.
One year ago, VanEck put out a $3,211 price forecast for Solana for the year 2030. At the time, that represented a 10,600% increase in price. So that gives you an idea of just how high Solana might soar over the next few years. At that lofty price, Solana would have an implied market cap of more than $1.5 trillion. That's more than the current market cap of Bitcoin.
Of course, a lot needs to go right for Solana over the next five years. It needs to continue to gain on Ethereum, especially in key blockchain niches such as decentralized finance (DeFi). And it needs to come up with everyday, practical uses for its new mobile devices. If it can do all that, though, Solana might just make you forget all about Bitcoin.

58550,2021-11-18 03:48:00,Will Larix Be the Next Dark Horse Project on Solana?,"Seattle, Washington--(Newsfile Corp. - November 17, 2021) - Solana ecosystem is growing rapidly. Looking at the entire blockchain industry landscape, mainly consisting of mining, exchanges, and public chains, and for a capable development team, public chains have always been ""a battleground for warriors."" 2018 is the first year when public chains debuted, and the success of Ethereum set off a situation of contention among hundreds of public chain projects at that time. But unexpectedly, 2021 has been the year when the public chain collectively exploded. From Ethereum, which set off the DeFi wave, to exchange public chains BSC, HECO, and OEC, to Polygon, Solana, AVAX, Fantom, Terra, and Arbitrum, the situation of a hundred flowers blooming in public chain projects have taken shape.

The Solana public chain is undoubtedly a winner that has maintained a competitive edge. Since the beginning of this year, the market value has been running wild, and it has jumped to No. 4 in the crypto market value rankings, second only to BTC, ETH, and BNB. The price of its currency has also risen from around US$1 at the beginning of the year to around US$250 today, which is a veritable one-hundred-fold project. The skyrocketing token price and market value is a microcosm of Solana's ecological outbreak. As of press time, Solana has locked up more than 1.5 billion U.S. dollars and hosting more than 500 ecological projects.

• Solana Ecosystem
According to the Solana official website (https://solana.com/ecosystem), the data shows that the Solana ecosystem has covered major roles such as browsers, wallets, oracles, DeFi, NFT, GameFi, tools, and Dapps. Among them, DeFi and NFT projects account for 2/3 of the total.

Almost all of the top 10 TVL projects in the ecosystem are DeFi projects. There is no doubt that the DeFi track will be the place where top gainers will appear.
Figure 4- TVL ranking of the Solana project: Data from DeFiLIamaTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/7829/104029_2c0790d9c48c7a20_004full.jpg
The cornerstone of DeFi is the DEX and lending, so leading projects must appear in DEXs and lending platforms. As a public chain known for its high performance, Solana is naturally friendly to DEX, so it is evident that half of the top 10 TVL projects are DEXs (Raydium, Serum, Saber, Orca, Atrix) and among the top five projects, four of them are also DEXs. It can be said that DEX has basically run out on Solana. The three-point situation of Raydium, Serum, and Orca has basically been set, and these three projects have already obtained high market estimates. The value of their token prices have also surged.
However, the lending platforms have not exploded on Solana yet. None of the top 5 TVL projects are lending platforms, and there are only two lending platforms within the top 10, and they are ranked at the bottom. Comparing public chains such as ETH and BSC, one of the top three projects in the ecosystem will inevitably be a lending platform because DEXs and lending platforms are the infrastructures of DeFi, and most of the funds will eventually be deposited in DEXs and lending agreements. In fact, as shown in the figure below, of the top 5 projects in Defi locked positions, 2 are lending projects. Therefore, the next largest leading project in the Solana ecosystem is most likely to be a lending product. The entire lending market should have more than 10 times the growth space.

• The potential undisputed lending project
According to the analysis, the author noticed that there is a very rapid development of a lending project on Solana, namely, Larix (projectlarix.com), Solana's lending gateaway. When the author first noticed this project, it was in the hackathon during July this year, when the project was ranked first in the Asian division. Unexpectedly, only 2 months later, this project went live on the main network in mid-September and launched their mining functionality almost simultaneously. DeFiLlama data shows that Larix has been ranked first in lending for a long time after it went online. Larix may be the fastest growing lending project on Solana.

The author found that the strength behind this project should not be underestimated. In summary, there are ten points, enough to prove that Larix is ​​likely to become the next dark horse project on Solana.
1. Strong security. According to the official website, Larix is ​​the first lending project on Solana that has been audited by the well-known audit company-SlowMist. SlowMist has also released news on the chain, mentioning that Larix was ​​their second audited client on Solana. The authority of SlowMist in the field of blockchain security is self-evident. The ability to pass SlowMist's audit before going online shows that the team attaches great importance to security and the security of the project itself is also guaranteed. Compared with several other lending companies, Port is audited by Bramah, Solend is audited by Kudelski, and Apricot is audited by Halborn. The influence of these audit institutions in the industry is not as good as that of SlowMist, and Jet has not released audit information to the public as of press time. For investors, security always comes first. From an audit perspective, Larix is ​​undoubtedly the safest lending platform on Solana.

1. High yield rewards. By comparison, it will be found that the deposit rewards of mainstream tokens on Larix are ​​higher than that of other lending platforms. On the one hand, the project holds accelerated mining activities where mining APR during golden mining weeks are higher. On the other hand, Larix's interest rate model is also somewhat different from other lending platforms, resulting in deposit returns being relatively higher. Taking ETH as an example, the deposit APY of ETH on Larix is ​​6.13%, while on Jet it is only 0.02%, Apricot 1.09%, Solend 5.22%, and Port has not yet supported ETH deposits.

1. Good liquidity. For investment, in addition to considering safety and profitability, another very important factor is liquidity. For lending platforms, liquidity refers to whether a certain token has enough balance for lending and whether deposits can be withdrawn at any time. In other words, the user can withdraw or borrow a token at any time, and when the user lends a large amount of a certain token, it will not cause the borrowing interest rate to rise sharply. When the user deposits a large amount of a certain token, it does not cause a sharp drop in deposit interest rates. Take the stable currency USDT on Solana as an example. The liquidity (remaining loanable balance) of USDT on Larix is ​​20M, Solend is 16M, Apricot is 10M, and Port's liquidity is 3M. ​​Stablecoins have always been the demand in the lending market. The largest currency.

4. Innovation. Larix's official introduction mentioned that all asset value targets, such as cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, synthetic assets, NFTs, and asset-backed securities (accounts receivable, invoices, mortgage loans, etc.), will be included in asset collateral The series, by creating an effective risk management resource pool, realizes that all valuable assets can be fully used in a safe and effective manner. It is reported that the team is advancing related developments for this innovation. If the types of mortgageable assets can be greatly expanded as described above, it may bring a new vitality to the DeFi lending field. At the same time, the team also revealed to the community that Larix will consider launching NFT and POAP systems in the future, refined and personalized lending services, and combined with more Web3 projects in a similar ""plug-in"" form, gradually becoming an underlying financial infrastructure . Compared with several other lending companies, the combination of Apricot's smart liquidation and leveraged lending is also a good point of innovation.

5. Background. According to official Twitter news, Larix has received investment from as many as 18 institutions, namely, Solana Capital, SolarEcoFund, Epsilon, Huobi Ventures, Gate, MXC Global, BitMart, Fenbushi, Polygon, FBG, 3Commas, LD Capital, Lancer Capital, ZONFF, FACT Block, Libra, IPC, OIG Capital, etc., including Solana Capital, SolarEcoFund and other institutions with official Solana backgrounds, as well as well-known investors in the industry such as Huobi, Fenbushi, LD Capital, and 3Commas. The luxurious investment lineup also demonstrates that the project and team have been recognized by the capital market, and a great future can be expected. Correspondingly, Solend has received investment from 15 institutions, Port has been favored by 14 institutions, Jet has also received injections from 9 institutions, and Apricot has 9 institutional investors. Several lending companies have relatively strong Solana official capital backgrounds, and it can be seen that Solana is actually supporting the lending sector with great optimism.

6. Good product experience. Larix's UI design is very user-friendly, and the simple and clear product operation interface makes it easy for DeFi novice users to get started. The homepage clearly displays the user's capital utilization rate and net return rate, the local currency income, mining income, liquidity, daily token release, supply circulation market value, and other data are all at a glance on the official website. Larix also has a separate clearing page where all users can participate in the clearing in an open, transparent, and fair manner. The threshold for clearing is very low and the operation is very simple. This will not only further guarantee the security of the platform's funds but also give ordinary users the opportunity to participate in liquidation and make profits. Larix's official documents are also very detailed, especially the liquidation part. In contrast, Port will charge a 0.1% ""Borrow Fee""in addition to the borrowing interest irrespective of the amount and the duration. Solend charges no more than 0.1% of ""head-cutting interest"" in addition to the borrowing interest. When most users borrow money, they are not aware that in addition to borrowing interest, they will be charged an additional platform borrowing fee.

7. The Community. One of the most impressive things is the rapid growth of Larix's community. Larix is ​​undoubtedly one of the largest and most active projects on Solana. For a decentralized DeFi project, the community is one of the most important backbones. The size and vitality of the community also directly reflect the popularity and development potential of a project. As of press time, Larix's Twitter followers have exceeded 100,000, and the number of Telegram and Discord groups combined have also exceeded 100,000, and both are relatively active. At the same time, Larix already supports 7 languages, with a wide distribution of user groups, and growing. Six regional communities have been established, with a wide distribution of user groups. In comparison, Solend has 35,000 Twitter followers and 12,000 on Discord; Port's Twitter has 58,000 followers and their aggregate Discord and Telegram amounts to 60,000; Apricots Twitter followers comes to 31,000 and their Discord and Telegram amounts to 23,000; and Jet's Twitter followers are 22,000 while their Discord has 12,000 members. Larix's community is obviously much larger.

8. The progress of the project. The author has been following Larix's official Twitter and found that Larix is ​​one of the most frequently updated projects on Solana, and the progress of the project has been very fast. From product iteration, project cooperation, community growth, listing on the exchange, to financing progress, including the growth of TVL, it is significantly faster than other projects. The picture below is a snapshot of the monthly report released by Larix on the official medium, which details the recent growth of the project. Larix's impression is that it has developed rapidly and every step is solid, and its importance as the underlying lending platform in the Solana ecosystem has become increasingly prominent. In contrast, Solend and Apricot have just launched their mainnets respectively, and the mining rewards of the three companies including Jet have not yet begun distribution.

9. The Fundamentals. Larix's token economic model shows that 55% of the LARIX token supply will be used for mining, 15% will be used for financing, 10% will belong to the team, 15% will be used for ecological construction, and lastly, 5% will be devoted to marketing and operations. At present, less than 1 million LARIX are distributed through loan mining and liquidity mining every day, with a value of less than $60,000. Low inflation, low circulation, and low market value makes Larix's currency price hugely undervalued. As of press time, the market price of LARIX on MEXC is trading at $0.06, which is 8 times higher than the IEO price of $0.0075. Judging from the MEXC data, the currency price has experienced several fluctuations back and forth, but it cannot fall lower at all. What stands behind it is the strong consensus of the community. LARIX's two TVL pools on DEXs, Raydium and ORCA, totaled 10 million U.S. dollars. The output distribution, circulation market value, and circulation of the tokens can be viewed on the official website. The team has done a good job in the openness and transparency of the project. Solend's IDO valuation was too high in the early stage and it has seriously deviated from the market. Later, it is bound to experience a painful process of debubbling (refer to Parrot). Port's mainnet launch supports the small currencies of other platforms such as PAI, MER, SBR, and there is no doubt that a potential for systemic risks (refer to Venus being manipulated by a large user XVS attack) exists. In addition to financing Jet, it seems that there hasn't been much movement in products and operations in recent months.

At the same time, according to the admins in the telegram community, the core team of Larix originates from Silicon Valley and Singapore, and has extensive DeFi development and operational experience. It can be seen on Twitter that Larix has reached strategic cooperation with core projects in the ecosystem such as Raydium, Marinade, ORCA, Tulip, and Slope, and has obtained extensive support within the ecosystem. The Lego combination effect of DeFi has begun to appear. More and more media and KOLs in the Solana ecosystem are also promoting Larix, and the increase in attention also indicates that the project is gaining wider recognition in the market.
10. The Long-term plan. According to the team in the community, Larix will have a series of major product updates soon, including leveraged lending and interest-bearing asset LP mortgage lending. Leveraged lending will greatly increase the fund utilization rate of the platform, which will bring higher profits to users while also increasing agreement rewards. The community has initiated discussions about binding agreement revenue with tokens in the form of dividends, token repurchasing, and destruction through a DAO. If the community can promote the implementation, it will undoubtedly greatly stimulate the market. The mortgage lending of interest-earning assets such as LP is an important direction of DeFi 2.0. There are a huge amount of LP assets in the Solana ecosystem. The LP machine gun pool, Sunny's TVL, exceeds 1.1 billion U.S. dollars, and the stable currency converter Saber's TVL exceeds 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. However, the LP mortgage lending business on Solana is yet to develop. If Larix can support the LP assets of other platforms such as Raydium, Saber and ORCA, it will likely grow by an order of magnitude in TVL.
At the same time, the author also noticed that the team initiated a discussion about IPO (Initial Pool Offering) in the community, and may sell tokens publicly in the near future to raise more funds for adding the second pool, which will also stimulate more Investors to buy tokens. The latest official Twitter shows that it is cooperating with MEXC to engage in a trading contest. This seems to imply that exciting things are coming for the community.

3. Conclusion
From last summer to present, ""DeFi Summer"" has set off a wave of wealth creation in the encryption field, which has made countless encryption enthusiasts crazy. In the bull market , choice is more important than hard work. In the competition of the ""Iron Throne"" of the public chain, Ethereum's congestion and high handling fees have given the new public chain the opportunity to rise, and Solana, backed by FTX and SBF, is undoubtedly the most powerful contender of Ethereum in the new public chain. Betting on the rise of the Solana ecosystem has become an important part of many investor portfolios. DeFi is the foundation of the public chain ecology, and lending is the underlying facility of DeFi, so betting on a potential undisputed lender project within the Solana ecology may have very promising gains. So, will Larix be the next leading project of the leading public chain Solana?

The policy is to exclude or adjust items that are considered to be significant in both nature or size and where the treatment as an adjusted item provides stakeholders with useful information to assess the year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter underlying performance. On this basis, the following items were adjusted or excluded for the Q422 results:Removal of IFRS 2 treatment of share-based payments which include the deferral of a portion of the current year share plans as well as recognition of prior years’ share plans. This adjustment provides insights into the relationship between the current year variable employee expenses and current year trading performanceOther income line includes all the realized and unrealized results on Flow Traders’ long-term equity investments whether accounted for as Fair Value Other Comprehensive Income (FV OCI), Fair Value Profit and Loss (FVPL) or Results of Equity Accounted InvestmentsExclusion of one-off expenses which relate specifically to the completed corporate holding structure update.

48225,2022-03-01 07:33:27,Cryptoverse: Bitcoin gains conflict currency credentials,"By Medha Singh and Lisa Pauline Mattackal
(Reuters) - Bitcoin has leapt since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, bolstered by people in those countries looking to store and move money in anonymous and decentralised crypto.
Bitcoin trading denominated in the Russian rouble went into overdrive when the invasion began on Thursday, with daily volumes rising 259% from a day earlier to 1.3 billion rouble ($13.1 million), according to data from CryptoCompare.
In Ukraine, meanwhile, crypto exchange Kuna saw its daily trading volume more than treble to 150 million hryvnias ($5 million).
Bea O'Carroll, managing director at Radkl, a digital asset investment firm, said the war and Western sanctions had seen a trend emerge of bitcoin being used to transfer value.
""Basically, having a currency that is not controlled by the government, that is not affected by the emergency acts ... is really interesting,"" she added. ""Maybe this is how Russia gets its value moved around. Equally, on the other side, there was 'this is how people are going to get value to the Ukrainians'.""
In the five days since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, bitcoin has risen 13%, while the S&P 500 U.S. stock index that it often mimics is up around 2% and traditional safety play gold is now largely flat after gaining as much as 3.5% on the day of the invasion.
On the day of the attack, about $300 million short bitcoin positions were liquidated, Coinglass data showed, while Singapore-based QCP Capital said ""a good portion"" of leveraged long positions had been taken out.
As well as being largely anonymous, crypto holdings and transactions are often held in wallets on decentralised platforms that can be accessed from anywhere.
ENTER THE OLIGARCHS
""Bitcoin could be a potential safe haven for Russian oligarchs avoiding sanctions as there will be no censor on the Bitcoin network and on cryptocurrency transactions,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.
""Cryptocurrencies could act as a powerful store of value for a major part of holdings that don't need to be liquid.""
Yet for crypto fans, the fact that such holdings could offer a route around sanctions could be a double-edged sword.
""It could lead to regulations from NATO countries against usage of crypto, but the flip side is that there could be broader adoption in places with geopolitical turmoil,"" said Katie Talati, head of research at digital asset manager Arca.
Ukraine was also quick to spot an opportunity in the crypto world's reach and anonymity. Vice-Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov tweeted the wallet addresses of bitcoin and ether, alongside an appeal: ""Stand with the people of Ukraine. Now accepting cryptocurrency donations.""
Fedorov's government and Ukrainian non-governmental organisations raised over $22 million in cryptocurrencies after the appeals, according to blockchain analysis company Elliptic.
While bitcoin may be emerging as a currency of choice in areas of geopolitical risk, however, market players caution there are differing views over whether it can more broadly become a ""safe-haven"" asset, a form of digital gold.
For Zach Friedman, co-founder of crypto brokerage Secure Digital Markets, bitcoin's post-invasion gains serve to enforce the ""narrative around bitcoin's store of value during turbulent times"".
STABLECOINS ON FIRE
Elsewhere: money is flowing into ""stablecoins"", which are pegged to traditional assets such as the U.S. dollar.
As of Friday, stablecoin transactions comprised over 83% of the total crypto market's 24-hour trading volume according to CoinMarketCap.
USD Tether, the largest stablecoin saw its market capitalization climb to an all time high of nearly $80 billion, while gold-backed cryptocurrency PAX Gold added nearly $100 million to its market cap in two days.

62991,2021-06-10 13:45:01,Should Value Investors Pick World Acceptance (WRLD) Stock?,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s putWorld Acceptance CorporationWRLD stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:
A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, World Acceptance has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11.79, as you can see in the chart below:
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 27.90. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, World Acceptance’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.25. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
However, we should point out that World Acceptance has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 19.10, so we might say that the forward earnings estimates indicate that the company’s share price will likely appreciate in the near future.
Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, World Acceptance has a P/S ratio of about 1.94. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 5.22 right now. As we can see in the chart below, this is slightly above the median for this stock in particular over the past few years.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
WRLD is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.
In aggregate, World Acceptance currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes World Acceptance a solid choice for value investors.
Though World Acceptance might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is WRLD a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current fiscal quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the fiscal full year estimate has seen two upward and one downward revision in the same time period.As a result, the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has risen by 5.8% in the past two months, while the fiscal full year estimate has declined 8.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:
World Acceptance Corporation price-consensus-chart | World Acceptance Corporation Quote
This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.
World Acceptance is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 15% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.
Blockchain and cryptocurrency has sparked one of the most exciting discussion topics of a generation. Some call it the “Internet of Money” and predict it could change the way money works forever.

18753,2021-09-28 11:45:43,Nigeria to become first country in Africa to launch CBDC,"The Central Bank of Nigeria’s eNaira website has gone live ahead of schedule. And, in the 24 hours following the launch, it received more than a million hits. The CBN stated that eNaira – a central bank-issued digital currency that provides a unique form of money denominated in Naira – would serve as both a medium of exchange and a store of value, offering better payment prospects in retail transactions when compared to cash payments. eNaira presents itself as the digital form of cash and is a direct liability on the Central Bank of Nigeria while the customer deposits are direct liabilities on the financial institutions. However, it seems that a lot of its future users in Nigeria are still arguing whether or not it is actually a cryptocurrency. Olumide Adesina, a CEO of Nigerian analyst firm TM Analytics believes the eNaira can’t replace the crypto market or fight and win Bitcoin. However, he stressed it could complement the crypto market and provide leverage for a growing number of people from Nigeria. Some praise eNaira’s benefits for financial inclusion, while others are concerned it would give central banks more control over citizens’ financial rights through the removal of intermediaries. eNaira makes remittance transfers easier Still, the official website says the eNaira will “cultivate economic growth, provide cheaper remittances, limit fraudulent behaviour, and is secure, among other benefits for its use”. Rakiya Mohammed, the bank’s director of information technology, recently explained eNaira could make remittance transfers easier for Nigerians working abroad. South Africa also recently announced a trial of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) for cross-border payments. The central bank said it could motivate other financial institutions around the world to work towards using the technology. Founder and CEO of cryptocurrency and digital asset exchange platform Botmecash, Oluwasegun Kosemani, said there was a rising interest in the use cases and value Bitcoin offers in Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja, Kaduna, Abeokuta, and among the Igbo tribe traders who import and export from China and Turkey. “This will blow up soon when the eNaira launches in Nigeria,” he said, adding that eNaira “is the beginning and pathway to the end of cash in the country”.",41986.61,0.03,42000.0,0.06,42038.76,0.16,41896.57,-0.18,41973.12
14997,2018-01-24 17:09:00,Is Enbridge Inc. a Buy in 2018?,"Energy infrastructure giantEnbridge(NYSE: ENB)is coming off a down year, with its shares dipping 7% even though the market was red-hot. While the energy sector underperformed last year, Enbridge's slump was mainly because its available cash flow from operations (ACFFO) per share was on pace to end the year 8% below 2016's level -- but that's also because the company issued a boatload of new shares to buy Spectra Energy as well as finance expansion projects.
Those growth initiatives should start paying off in 2018, with Enbridge expecting ACFFO per share to rebound 15% this year. Consequently, its stock is dirt cheap right now, which is one of the many reasons Enbridge looks like a compelling buy for 2018.

One of the attractions for investors is Enbridge's dividend, which at 4.7%, is well above average. However, what's even more critical is its safety, which is where Enbridge's payout shines. After all, the company generates very predictable cash flow since 96% of its earnings come from fee-based contracts or similar rate structures. Meanwhile, it only pays out about 65% of its cash in support of the dividend, which is a conservative level for a pipeline company. For comparison's sake, rivalTarga Resources(NYSE: TRGP)only gets about 66% of its earnings from stable sources and yet pays out just about everything that comes in to support its 7.1% dividend yield. That puts Targa at high risk of having to reduce its payout if cash flow dives as a result of plunging commodity prices.
That said, as good as Enbridge's dividend is right now, it's only expected to get better in the coming years. The company completed 14 billion Canadian dollars ($11.4 billion) of growth projects last year and had another CA$22 billion ($17.8 billion) underway. These expansions should drive its ACFFO up 15% this year and by a 10% compound annual growth rate through 2020. That will enable anincrease in its dividend at that same pace. For perspective, thatmatches the growth rateof fellow Canadian pipeline rivalTransCanada(NYSE: TRP), though with a 4.2% payout, investors can collect more income from Enbridge over that time frame.

That said, what sets Enbridge apart from most other pipeline rivals is its valuation. With the stock currently trading at $39.50 apiece and given the expectation that the company can generate between CA$4.15 to CA$4.45 ($3.37 to $3.61) per share in ACFFO this year, it implies a valuation of 11.3 times cash flow. That makes it one of the cheapest pipeline stocks in the sector considering that the average one trades at about 14.9 times cash flow. In fact, despite much weaker financials, Targa Resources trades at 14 times cash flow while TransCanada sells for around 15 times even though it has similar metrics and growth prospects as Enbridge.
That valuation discount doesn't make any sense. While the company does have an elevated leverage ratio of more than 5.0 times at the moment, that's because it has been financing a massive expansion project backlog. As those projects enter service, it should push that metric to a more comfortable level of less than 4.0 times by 2020. In fact, the company is planning to sell some non-core assets to help it get leverage down quicker.
After a down year in 2017, Enbridge is on pace to bounce back this year as recently completed expansion projects should bolster earnings. That catalyst could drive the stock much higher in 2018 and help push its valuation closer to the peer group average. That said, in addition to that bounce-back potential, Enbridge is on track to grow earnings and its already generous dividend by double digits over the next few years, which could potentially give it the fuel to deliver market-beating returns over that time frame. It's that combination of near-term upside and long-term potential for such an excellent price that makes Enbridge a stock to consider buying this year.

53911,2022-04-29 14:08:16,"Costco Stock Is Expensive, But for Perfectly Fine Reasons","Costco(NASDAQ:COST) is an incredible retail machine. COST stock keeps on going up and up; it has nearly doubled since the beginning of 2020 and it’s up more than 200% over the past five years. This has started to attract some naysayers who say that Costco should be selling off like so many other companies that saw business surge during the pandemic. As the likes ofPeloton Interactive(NASDAQ:PTON) andZoom Video(NASDAQ:Z, NASDAQ:ZM) have crashed back to Earth after their 2020 rallies, why hasn’t Costco pared back its gains? There’s a good answer to this question.
Costco is an incredibly consistent business. That’s true both from a decades-long perspective and, more narrowly, since the pandemic started. Since the 1990s, Costco has reliably opened a similar amount of new stores each and every year, gradually adding more cities, customers and local economies to its network. The steady pace of growth has led to incredible scale effects and a working system to keep reinvesting capital. Costco has rewarded shareholders not only with massive share price gains but also increasing dividends, both ordinary and special.
That’s all well and good, but wasn’t Costco supposed to slow down by now? After people stocked up during the pandemic, sales of many consumer staples items have tailed off significantly, taking down their associated producers with them. And yet Costco is still putting up double-digit revenue growth. A big part of this is due to inflation. Costco has a reputation for low prices; in fact, it promises not to charge more than a 15% markup on goods versus its own cost. This gives customers confidence to shop at Costco during this period of rapidly escalating headline inflation. Costco also sells gasoline at lower prices than peers, which has been a big traffic driver lately given the historic surge in gas prices over the past year.
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Now, Costco is set to benefit from its customer loyalty. The company has a tradition of raising its club membership fees around once every five years. The five-year anniversary of Costco’s last price hike will be upcoming this summer, so an announcement on that front could be forthcoming. With inflation running red hot, Costco has the ability to push through a significant increase on its pricing. Also, on the topic of inflation, there’s one other fun kicker to the COST stock story.
• 7 Stocks to Watch Based on Unusual Options Activity
Unlike most retailers, Costco owns most of the land and buildings which house its stores. Thanks to sharply rising land prices, the value of Costco’s owned real estate is appreciating significantly. That doesn’t matter to near-term operating results, but it’s a nice underappreciated tailwind to the Costco story.
Now sure, COST stock is at 43 times this year’s estimated earnings. That could certainly come in a little bit if the stock market pulls back more in coming months. However, the valuation isn’t nearly as wild as it might seem at first glance. The company is doing just about everything right, after all, despite unprecedented economic volatility.

Yesterday,Bitcoinmade an attempt to settle below the support at $32,000 but failed to develop sufficient downside momentum. As a result, Bitcoin continues to trade in the $32,000 – $35,000 range. However, it should be noted that Bitcoin is close to the lower end of this range, and another test of the important support level at $32,000 looks imminent. If Bitcoin manages to settle below this level, it may gain strong downside momentum which will be bearish for all cryptocurrencies including Shiba Inu.
Dogecoin, which often has a material impact on Shiba Inu, remains under pressure. Currently, Dogecoin is trying to settle below $0.19. Dogecoin’s downside trend looks strong which is bearish for Shiba Inu.
At this point, it is clear that Shiba Inu will need additional upside catalysts to get back to the upside mode.
Shiba Inu managed to settle below the support at $0.000008 and is testing the next support level at $0.000007. RSI remains in the moderate territory, and there is plenty of room to gain additional downside momentum.
If Shiba Inu declines below $0.000007, it will move towards the next support level at $0.0000063. A successful test of this level will open the way to the test of the support at $0.0000055. This support level has been tested several times in June and proved its strength.
In case Shiba Inu settles below the support at $0.0000055, it will gain additional downside momentum and head towards the support at $0.0000044.
On the upside, the previous support at $0.000008 will serve as the first resistance level for Shiba Inu. The next resistance level has emerged at $0.000009. In case Shiba Inu manages to settle above the resistance at $0.000009, it will head towards the major resistance level at $0.000010.

54874,2022-11-14 22:56:00,"Bitcoin Mining Firm TeraWulf Raised $17M of Capital in Q3, But Cash Reserves Remain Low","Bitcoin mining company TeraWulf (WULF) raised $17 million in capital in the third quarter, but its liquidity remains at $4.5 million, according to astatement on its third quarter earningsreleased after the market close on Monday.
The $17 million came from $9.5 million in equity from existing investors and $7.5 million of incremental proceeds under aterm loan. The Monday statement said that $138.5 million of principal under the term loan was outstanding at the end of the quarter.
Cash flow has proven to be a key determinant of miners' ability to navigate the bear market, with some major miners facing liquidity crises that could even lead them to bankruptcy.
TeraWulf's costs of revenue increased dramatically in the quarter as energy prices in New York State, where it mainly operates, soared while it increased its energy demand with new operations. The miner paid 134% in costs per dollar of revenue, compared to 43% in Q2. The miner is trying to bring costs down for 2023, the statement said.
In the same quarter, TeraWulf significantly increased its hashrate, or computing power, and energy capacity that could be used for deploying mining machines. About 50 megawatts (MW) of power were brought online at its mining facility in Lake Mariner in upstate New York. The company had 11,000 miners operating at the end of the quarter, and another 9,000 are scheduled to be plugged into the 50 MW in Lake Mariner. As a result of the expansion, WULF mined 117 bitcoin in the third quarter, compared to 29 in the second quarter.
WULF share prices were down 0.8% in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq on Monday.
TeraWulf also said it ""right-sized"" its investment in a joint venture with a subsidiary of Talen Energy to 25%. The venture relates to a 200 MW mine in Pennsylvania, dubbed Nautilus.
The miners' computing power goal for the first quarter of 2023 remained unchanged at 5.8 exahash/second (EH/s).
TeraWulf is one of themost indebted publicly listed minerscompared with its equity, data analyzed by CoinDesk in June showed.

64610,2023-05-12 17:25:03,Perpetual Futures in Crypto Guide & Top Exchanges for Trading Crypto Perpetual Contracts,"Los Angeles, California --News Direct-- Bitcoin Journal The cryptocurrency market has introduced various innovative financial instruments to cater to the diverse needs of traders. Among these instruments, perpetual futures and perpetual contracts have become increasingly popular. In this article, we will explain the basics of perpetual futures, including funding rates and leverage, and compare the features of some of the top exchanges for trading crypto perpetual contracts. Understanding Perpetual Futures and Perpetual Contracts What are Perpetual Futures? Perpetual futures, also known as perpetual contracts or crypto perpetual, are a type of financial derivative in the cryptocurrency market. These contracts allow traders to take long or short positions on an underlying asset without expiry. They are designed to mimic the underlying asset's price, making them popular for trading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Key Features of Perpetual Futures Funding Rate: The funding rate is a mechanism that helps perpetual contracts maintain a close relationship with the spot price of the underlying asset. When the funding rate is positive, long position holders pay short position holders; when it is negative, they pay long position holders. An interest rate is periodically exchanged between long and short positions. This exchange encourages traders to take positions that help bring the contract price closer to the spot price. Leverage: Leverage is a feature that allows traders to open positions larger than their account balance. While leverage can amplify potential profits, it also increases liquidation risk if the market moves against the trader's position. For example, with a 100x leverage, a trader can open a position worth $10,000 using only $100 of their capital. Comparing Top Exchanges for Trading Crypto Perpetual Contracts 1) Covo Finance Covo Finance , a decentralized perpetual exchange, is among the best exchanges for trading crypto perpetual contracts due to its extensive offerings and unique features.

Perpetual futures and perpetual contracts are terms that are often used interchangeably in the context of crypto trading. Perpetual Contracts refer to a type of financial derivative that allows traders to take long or short positions on an underlying asset without an expiry date. They are designed to mimic the underlying asset's price and are popular for trading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Perpetual futures aim to maintain a close relationship with the spot price of the underlying asset through a mechanism called the funding rate. This rate is exchanged periodically between long and short position holders to encourage positions that bring the contract price closer to the spot price. These contracts differ from traditional futures contracts with a predetermined settlement or expiration date. In summary, perpetual futures and perpetual contracts are the same financial instrument used in the cryptocurrency market to enable traders to speculate on the price of cryptocurrencies without the constraints of an expiry date. What is the difference between perpetual futures and traditional futures contracts? Perpetual futures do not have an expiry date, whereas traditional futures contracts have a predetermined settlement or expiration date. Perpetual futures aim to mimic the spot price of the underlying asset more closely, using a funding rate mechanism. How does leverage work in crypto perpetual contracts trading, and what risks are involved? Leverage allows traders to open positions larger than their account balance. While it can amplify potential profits, it also increases the risk of liquidation if the market moves against the trader's position. Liquidations occur when a trader's position is forcibly closed due to insufficient margin to maintain the position. Liquidation is more likely to occur when using high leverage, resulting in a loss of the trader's initial margin. What is the funding rate in perpetual futures trading? The funding rate is a mechanism that helps maintain the price of perpetual futures close to the spot price of the underlying asset. It is an interest rate exchanged periodically between long and short position holders to encourage positions that bring the contract price closer to the spot price. How do I choose the best exchange for trading crypto perpetual contracts? To choose the best exchange, consider available markets, trading fees, leverage options, security measures, user interface, and customer support. What are the best strategies for trading perpetual futures effectively? Strategies for trading perpetual futures include trend-following, range trading, and using technical indicators. Managing risk and adapting the strategy based on market conditions is essential. What are the fees associated with trading crypto perpetual contracts on various exchanges? Fees associated with trading crypto perpetual contracts typically include maker and taker fees, funding rate fees, and, in some cases, withdrawal fees. Each exchange has its fee structure, so it's essential to research and compare before trading. Can I trade crypto perpetual contracts with a small amount of capital? Yes, you can trade crypto perpetual contracts with a small amount of capital, as most exchanges offer high-leverage options. However, it's crucial to understand the risks associated with using high leverage. The safety of your funds depends on the exchange's security measures, such as cold storage, multi-signature wallets, and two-factor authentication. It's essential to research the exchange's security measures and follow best practices for securing your account and wallet.

BCB told CoinDesk via email the timeframe for the adoption of a Brazilian CBDC depended on the evolution of the bank’s current projects and the international landscape.
“According to the current BCB assessment, the conditions for the adoption of a Brazilian CBDC will be achieved in two to three years,” the bank said. CBDCs are digital versions of a nation’s currency issued by a central financial authority.

The comments contrast withprevious statementsmade by the country’s chief central banker, Roberto Campos Neto, who said his country could be ready for a digital currency next year.
Fresh elements of Brazil’s financial system include a newly launched instant payment system known as PIX and the expected launch of itsopen bankingmodel. The bank said it depended on the success of these elements to propel it toward a CBDC launch.
Still, the bank was upbeat about the prospects a digital real could bring for the country.
“The implantation of a Brazilian CBDC may provide new tools to foster innovation and competition in an increasingly digital economy; reduce the use of cash and therefore its maintenance cost; improve cross-border payment processes; curb illegal activities and improve financial inclusion,” the bank said.

The bank also said it was “actively” participating in international discussions relating to global standards for national CBDCs and that the next step was to assess their impact on Brazil’s economy.
“After establishing general directives regarding the desirable features of a digital real, an open discussion with stakeholders will bring up use cases and improve our understanding of the CBDCs potentials in the specific case of the Brazilian economy.”

Thefrog-themed PEPE token, which saw one lucky buyer turn a $250 investment into anon-paper profit of over $1 million, has shed 30% of its value from its peak on April 20 and is down 13% on the day, perCoinGecko.
Dogecoin, the largest memecoin by market cap, has tumbled over 12% in the past week, according toCoinGecko—with most of thetop-ranked memecoinsalso slipping by double digits over the same time period.
The week starting April 17 saw a massive memecoin surge led by the newly-launched PEPE. The resulting “meme coin frenzy” sawhigh trading volumessnarling up the Ethereum network.
Uniswap Trades Soar as Pepe Mania Grips Meme Coin Market
Memecoinsare, as the name suggests, typically linked to internet memes such asPepe the FrogorDoge. The central motivation behind high trading volumes for memecoins is typically short-term gains, as traders hope to capitalize on news linked to the memecoin and its underlying meme.
The majority of memecoins have little to no fundamental value and trade entirely on popularity; they are usually issued in large quantities, with market prices of less than a cent to make them look cheaper and attract potential buyers.
What Is PepeCoin (PEPE)?
Memecoins are constantly issued and traded in the market, however, there are occasions when a few memecoins bring massive gains for certain traders—leading to a short-term phenomenon as traders hunt for the next ""moonshot.""
A similar trend occurred at the start of 2023, when theBONK memecoinon Solana surged, turning a $1,000 airdrop into $122,000 in the space of a week.
Last week, a number of factors propped up the memecoin market, including reports of PEPE holders makinghuge on-paper gains, coupled with excitement around ""Dogeday"" on thememe-friendly date of 4/20, and bullish sentiment across the wider crypto market as Bitcoin traded around $30,000.
However, Bitcoin's downturn during the week and “sell the news” price action on Dogecoin following Dogeday saw the memecoin phenomenon fizzle out by the weekend.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Intuitive Surgical(NASDAQ:ISRG)remains a dominant player in the robotic-surgery industry, as demand for minimally invasive surgeries continues to grow at a robust pace. Although demand for elective procedures is far from returning to pre-pandemic levels, its operating results continue to impress.
It posted stellar first-quarter results, whererevenues came in at $1.5 billion, compared to $1.29 billion from the same period last year. Growth was attributable to a 19% bump in elective procedures using da Vinci systems. The company’s flagship da Vinci systems continue to be a hit providing surgeons with an in-depth view of the operating fields they’re working on and intricate instruments for precision. Moreover, Intuitive also earns revenues from the sale of accessories and instruments, a figure which shot up 15% to $810 million during the first quarter. The pandemic-led headwinds have faded away, and ISRG can push on toward bigger and better things.
Teladoc Health(NYSE:TDOC) is a telehealth services provider covering primary, mental and chronic illness management. Over 3.2 million people in the U.S. booked visits with the company during the first quarter, while itsmembership base shot up to 54.3 million, both representing record numbers.
• 7 REITs to Buy for a Bear Market
Teladoc expects its membership base to rise by 1% to 5% this year, whilerevenue could surge as high as 23%. Moreover, the ratio of paid visits increased by 23.4% in the first quarter, compared to just 17.5% in the same period last year. If the business can continue to grow at such an impressive pace, it could move quickly toward breaking even.
CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ:CRWD) is one of the leading and fastest-growing cyber security businesses. Its cloud-native platform, Falcon, effectively removes the need for on-site security devices, which is typically quite difficult to scale. Its disruptive offering has enabled it to generate close to 100% revenue growth over a five-year period.
In the most recent quarter,subscriptions rose 57% year-over-year, while annual recurring revenue increased by a remarkable 61%. These growth rates have remained stable over the past year. Moreover, customers using over four modules have grown steadily, allowing the enterprise to keep its net retention rate over its target level of 120%. Moreover, CRWD commands a strong margin profile, with its gross profit margin over 73% on a trailing-twelve-month basis.
Globant SA(NYSE:GLOB) is a popular IT and software development enterprise that has consistently generated double-digit revenue growth over the past several years. It boasts a growing number of blue-chip clients from a wide variety of sectors, which minimizes the volatility in sales. Moreover, it continues to acquire new companies and add new services, which can be conveniently cross-sold to its massive client base.
• 7 Top Stocks to Buy and Hold
Demand for internet-related IT services was huge during the pandemic years, which is why GLOB stock was on a tear. Growth rates have normalized but are still highly impressive under the circumstances. In its first quarter,it generated $401.4 million in sales, representing a 48.6% increase from the prior-year period. Moreover, the company has recently provided consulting services, AI-powered tools for software development and customer relationship management, and other products that will drive the next growth phase.
Fiverr International(NYSE:FVRR) is a leading online marketplace connecting freelancers or independent contractors to businesses and other individuals. Pandemic-led tailwinds have accelerated hybrid and remote working trends, which led to a massive surge in sales for the platform. It has witnessed immense strength across its top line, with gross margins of over 70%.
2021 was a blockbuster year for the business, with a57% jump in saleson a year-over-year basis to $297.7 million. Nevertheless, investors will likely be disappointed with its25% to 27% revenue guidancefor 2022. However, total active buyers on the platform continue to increase at a staggering pace, which should continue boosting sales. Total active buyers rose by 23% to 4.2 million last year compared to 2020, which is incredible. If it can continue to add new features, it will significantly increase the stickiness of its platform, thereby resulting in massive top-line growth.
Snap(NYSE:SNAP) is a social media giant that has proven to be an anomaly in the sector. Although its stock revalued lower this year, its underlying business continues to make solid progress. It has been increasing its active users, revenues and cash flows at a brisk pace. Moreover, a robust sales forecast has been submitted for the second quarter.
Company revenues shot up 38%in the first quarter to $1.06 billion compared to the same period last year. Moreover, it expects to see 20% to 25% year-over-year growth in sales for the upcoming quarter. Also, its free cash flows for the first quarter came in at an impressive $106 million, which marks the third straight quarter of positive FCF.

Additionally, Snap has enough liquidity to implement new changes and remarkably positively impact its long-term potential.
Boot Barn(NYSE:BOOT) is a juggernaut in work-related and western footwear. It has been a highly consistent performer, with a 33% increase in comparable sales during the fourth quarter compared to a 27% increase from the same quarter last year.

• The sell-off capped a losing week for indexes as investors look ahead to a pivotal period for markets.
• Consumer inflation data is due Tuesday, and the Fed announces its decision on rates Wednesday.
US stocks fell Friday after wholesale inflation rose more than expected last month, raising concerns that the Federal Reserve will keep rates higher for longer.
The producer price index rose 0.3% in November from the prior month, exceeding expectations of 0.2%. That sets up markets for next week, with consumer inflation data coming out on Tuesday and the Fed's policy decision due on Wednesday.
While the central bank is widely expected to slow down the pace of its rate hikes as inflation comes off its highs, signs of sticky prices could push back the timeline for an eventual Fed pivot toward lower rates.
Meanwhile, Friday's slump capped a losing week for markets, with the Dow down 2.3%, the S&P 500 off 2.8%, and the Nasdaq shedding 3.4%.
Here's where US indexes stood as the market closed at 4:00 p.m. on Friday:
• S&P 500: 3,934.29, down 0.74%
• Dow Jones Industrial Average: 33,475.60, down 0.91% (305.88 points)
• Nasdaq Composite:11,004.62, down 0.7%
Here's what else is going on today:
• There's little comfort to be had in a recent softening in mortgage ratesbecause the Fed is likely to continue with its string of rate hikes, billionaire property investor Sam Zell said.
• Stocks have entered a new bull marketand the S&P 500 could soar 26% in the next 12 months, Leuthold Group's Jim Paulsen said.
• Stocks won't be hit as badly by weakening corporate earningsin 2023 as many think, according to BlackRock strategist Kate Moore.

18968,2018-02-14 16:04:00,Bitcoin rallies as South Korea quells fears of a cryptocurrency ban,"• South Korea stunned cryptocurrency markets in January by considering a ban on exchanges.
• An official has quelled those fears, saying the government will work to make crypto more transparent, according to Bloomberg.
• Bitcoin is up more than 8% Wednesday morning. You can track its price in real-time here.
Bitcoinis up more than 8% Wednesday morning, mirroring the broader cryptocurrency market, after the South Korean government appeared to backpedal on its reported plans to ban crypto mining and exchanges in the country.
In a video posted to the presidential website Wednesday, South Korea’s minister of Governmental Policy Coordination, Hong Nam-ki, said the government would look at making cryptocurrency trading more transparent, instead of banning it outright, as previously feared,Bloomberg reported.
In January, news reports of a potential ban fueled selloffs thatwiped out hundreds of billions of dollars of value from cryptocurrency markets around the world. Since then, more than 200,000 South Korean citizens signed an official government petition denouncing the proposed ban.
Bitcoin today remains the largest digital currency by market cap, and is now trading at $9,160 at the time of writing. That’s up more than 50% from its trough just below $6,000 on February 6. Bitcoin currently accounts for 35% of the total cryptocurrency market value, according toCoinMarketCap.com.
The total market value for cryptocurrencies is up 7% in the last 24 hours.
“The news today that South Korea will not ban cryptocurrencies outright has buoyed the market, following a period of negative news,"" Iqbal Gandham, managing director of crypto platform eToro said in an email. ""Rumours of regulatory clampdowns have worsened what is typically a bad time of the year for cryptos, but the tide is starting to turn – particularly with Singapore also ruling out a ban last week.""

28220,2019-04-22 10:13:00,Microsoft Korea: Country Faces Growing Threat From Stealth Crypto Mining Attacks,"Microsoft Korea has claimed the country is facing an increase in cryptojacking incidents, according to a report from local English-language daily The Korea Times, published on April 22. The findings were announced by Microsoft security program manager Kim Gwi-ryun during a press conference in Seoul today, which accompanied the release of the annual Microsoft Security Intelligence Report. As previously reported, cryptojacking is the practice of using a computer’s processing power to mine for cryptocurrencies without the owner’s consent or knowledge. According to The Korea Times, South Korea's cryptocurrency mining incident rate in 2018 was 0.05% —  reportedly 58% lower than the world average. Nonetheless, Kim Gwi-ryun isolated the malicious practice from among other cybersecurity attack vectors detected in the country — such as supply chain malware and phishing attempts. The representative noted that Microsoft has detected market correlations in the fluctuating prevalence of cryptojacking, stating that: ""We have noticed that as the value of cryptocurrency rises and falls, so does the mining encounter rate."" As the report notes, stealth cryptojacking is difficult to detect and largely manifests itself in compromised system performance due to the intensive drain on processing power that crypto mining presents. As Cointelegraph has reported , cryptojacking was cited in a recent criminal conviction of two Romanian alleged cybercriminals, who had been tracked in a joint investigation by the United States Federal Investigation Bureau and the Romanian National Police. A March 2019 report from AT&T Cybersecurity revealed that cryptojacking was one of the most prevalent objectives of hackers targeting businesses’ cloud infrastructures, despite the crypto bear market. That same month, reports surfaced of a new strain of Trojan malware for Android phones. The malware reportedly targets worldwide users of top crypto apps such as Coinbase , BitPay and Bitcoin Wallet, as well as banks including JPMorgan , Wells Fargo and Bank of America .

EOS broke through the first major resistance level at $2.7880 before falling to a mid-day intraday low $2.6858.

Failure to move through the $2.7388 pivot would bring the first major support level at $2.6634 into play.

U.S.-listed spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETF) saw over $880 million in inflows on Tuesday led by Fidelity, provisional data released on Wednesday shows.
Bitcoin rose over $71,000 in Asian trading hours as the data went public, adding 3% in the past 24 hours. The broad-basedCoinDesk 20 (CD20), an index of the largest tokens, rose 2.65%
Fidelity’s FBTC took on $378 million in inflows, the highest among counterparts. BlackRock’s IBIT followed with $270 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC – infamous for its outflows – took on $28 million.
This marked the best day of inflows since March and the second-highest overall since 11 bitcoin ETFs went live in January.
Inflow activity has picked up recently amid a generally bullish sentiment after a dismal few weeks from mid-April to early May, a period that saw zero net inflows on some days and even outflows from major ETFs such as BlackRock’s IBIT.
Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said on X that the ETFs have taken on $3.3 billion in the past four weeks, and their net year-to-date has crossed the $15 billion mark.

32725,2020-11-13 11:00:00,$300M in Bitcoin Flow to Binance From Huobi as China Gets Tougher on Exchanges,"As the Chinese government cracks down on several crypto exchanges catering to traders based in China, many of those customers – and their bitcoin – have been making their way to Binance over the past few days.
Bitcoinflows to Binance from Huobi reached an all-time high since the Huobi chief operating officer, Robin Zhu, allegedly went missing on Nov. 2. According to data provided by CryptoQuant, a total number of 18,652 bitcoin, worth nearly $300 million, was transferred from Huobi to Binance from that day until Nov. 11.
“A lot of users went to Binance because Chinese users are more familiar with Binance and Binance’s executives are all overseas,” Colin Wu, a Chinese crypto reporter behind the Twitter account @WuBlockchain, told CoinDesk on a WeChat message.

A spokesperson from Binance declined to comment on any impact China’s crackdown could have on its business.
For months, Chinese regulators have been clamping down onmany crypto trading platformsthat cater mainly to Chinese clients. Some of these exchanges appear tohave close, albeit informal, relationships with the Chinese government.
The whereabouts of Huobi’s Zhu remains unclear sincerumors began circulatingin early November that alleged he was arrested by “local officials.” Prices for Huobi Token (HT) dropped to as low as $3.744 on Nov. 3, down 11.3% from $4.22 on Nov. 1, according toMessari.
Over at rival exchange OKEx, with deep ties to China, all withdrawal services remainsuspendedafter it said a holder of a private key needed to authorize withdrawals was out of touch while cooperating with public security investigators in China. OKEx’s native token OKBlost nearly 30%of its market value after the news broke.
Related:How Ant’s Suspended IPO Is Related to China’s Digital Yuan
Other exchanges are also feeling the heat. On Nov. 9, the person running TokenBetter, another crypto exchange with mostly Chinese users, was reportedly “under investigation.” TokenBetter’s platform banned its withdrawal service on Oct. 16.
This is not the first attempt by the regulators in China to crack down on crypto exchanges. Bitcoin exchangesreceived orders to close their businessesin China after the country banned crypto trading activities in 2017.
Huobi is now based in Seychelles, while OKEx is in Malta. It is unclear where Binance’s main business operations are located – Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s chief executive officer,told CoinDeskhis company’s locations are “decentralized.”
Huobi did not answer CoinDesk’s question on where Zhu is currently, but in a WeChat message Ciara Sun, vice president of Huobi Global Markets, wrote that all operations at the company are “normal.”
“Do not listen to rumors,” she continued. “Huobi reserves the right to pursue legal responsibilities for those who spread rumors.”
Many have associated OKEx’s lost contact with one of its key holders withthe arrest of its co-founder Mingxing “Star” Xu. With Huobi’s executive allegedly being arrested, its users are afraid the same things will happen to the Seychelles-based exchange – even though Huobi hasguaranteedits users many times it is maintaining normal operations.
Multiple sources close to OKEx and Huobi told CoinDesk the new crackdown is associated with China’s efforts to fight money laundering and fraud, and it is unlikely to have any connection with China’s rollout of its central bank digital currency (CBDC), thedigital yuan.
“[China] doesn’t want digital [renminbi] products to be disruptive to what’s already in the financial system,” Felix Wang, managing director and partner at financial investment research firm Hedgeye, told CoinDesk in an interview. “The government wants to encourage innovation and development. They only want to crack down on products that they think are misleading to the public.”
Crypto exchanges are not the only target of the Chinese regulators in recent months. Perhaps the most well known case was Ant Group’s initial public offering,which was suspendedon both the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges after the company’s founder, Jack Ma, criticized China’s regulators in a speech on Oct. 24.
A possible, positive, long-term outcome of the crackdown for exchanges could be that it may encourage the regulators in China to eventually push some sort of a compliance process for crypto exchanges instead of banning them, according to Hao Wang, founder and chief executive officer of Hong Kong-based crypto brokerage CyberX.
“Most of these lost users from Huobi will eventually flow to the white-label exchanges because most traders [in Asia] do not currently have access to trading platforms with regulatory compliance,” Wang told CoinDesk in a WeChat message.
Nonetheless, as China increasingly tightens its grip on its fintech industry, others are also concerned that it will hurt the fintech industry as a whole – blockchain included – as such companies expand their business overseas.
“The sentiment is very bad for all countries outside of China looking to do business with China at this time,” Wang said.“People got worried when [China] introduced those micro financial regulations. They are thinking now this is going to be part of a little step of a bigger crackdown on fintech, finance-related payment and maybe blockchain.”

The company has previously conducted equity buybacks in order to resell those shares to new investors that it sees as helpful to its business, the source explained.
The source declined to provide further details about who would be joining Block.one’s list of backers.
Block.One’s New Social Media Site Will Do Identity Checks for Every User
Still, it’s helpful to revisit a previous instance of Block.one repurchasing equity from prior investors in order to bring on new ones. A recent report fromBloomberg– which cited a March 19 email to the startup’s shareholders – noted that some investors had received a 6,567 percent return on their Block.one holdings.
However, the Bloomberg report may have been unclear about which investors stood to gain so much.
“The buyback was designed for seed investors, who had been in for a long time, and it made room for potential future strategic shareholders in a way that didn’t unnecessarily inflate our balance sheet,” Brendan Blumer, Block.one’s CEO and one of the largest shareholders in the company, told CoinDesk.
“I did not participate,” he added.
Block.One Is Launching a Social Media Platform on the EOS Blockchain
Citing an email sent to shareholders on March 19, the Bloomberg report emphasizes the involvement of PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, along with noted investors Alan Howard and Louis Bacon.
The source told CoinDesk that Thiel, Bacon and Howard are strategic investors that came on in July 2018, much later than the seed investors. As such, the source said, Thiel, Bacon and Howard saw a 30 percent gain on their investments – a healthy return but nowhere near the 6,567 percent trumpeted in Bloomberg’s headline.
Block.one declined to share with CoinDesk the investor email that Bloomberg reviewed. It also declined to give CoinDesk a timeline for its seed investments. Still, the source said Block.one actually goes back several years.
The company’s balance sheet is “stronger than ever,” the source told CoinDesk.
Bloomberg reported that the company had $2.2 billion, mostly in U.S. government bonds. The investor letter said it also held 140,000 BTC. If Block.one still holds that much, it would be worth over $1 billion at face value.
On Saturday, the company announceda new social media platformcalled Voice. The company plans to use its reserves to market the service aggressively to the public.
A spokesperson for Howard declined a request for comment. Bacon and Thiel did not reply to requests for comment.

Goldman Sachs is planning to capitalize on the bear market by swooping in to buy crypto firms at rock-bottom prices.
That's according to Reuters, which claims the U.S. banking giant has a budget that stretches into tens of millions of dollars.
Goldman's head of digital assets, Mathew McDermott, told the news agency that FTX's collapse has emphasized why ""more trustworthy, regulated cryptocurrency players"" are needed.
But some critics might argue that the notion of a legacy financial institution owning crypto businesses undermines why Bitcoin was created in the first place.
Although the bank is currently performing due diligence on a number of crypto firms, McDermott was tightlipped on which projects are in Goldman's crosshairs.
This could be regarded as a rather bullish development, not least because one of the world's biggest banks believes that the crypto space still has something to offer — despite a number of confidence-crushing bankruptcies, and a sharp fall in the value of major coins. He said:

40367,2018-07-15 05:01:58,Bitcoin – Looking to Break Out From its Current Ranges,"Bitcoin gained 0.49% on Saturday, reversing Friday’s 0.47% fall, to end the day at $6,250.1.
Another relatively range bound start to the day saw Bitcoin pullback from an early morning high $6,277.6 to a late morning intraday low $6,179.2 before recovering to $6,200 levels, the day’s low seeing Bitcoin steer clear of the first major support level at $6,116.43.
An afternoon move saw Bitcoin break through to $6,300 levels and an intraday high $6,320 before pulling back to $6,200 levels late in the day, the first major support level at $6,331.33 left untested on the day.
While the news wires were on the quieter side through the first half of the weekend, news of investigator Mueller’s indictment of 12 Russians that reportedly used Bitcoin, amongst other cryptocurrencies, to meddle in the 2016 Presidential Elections had a relatively muted impact.
It remains to be seen how the U.S government and regulators will respond to the use of cryptocurrencies in the meddling, but one thing is for certain, the days of anonymity will certainly be numbered, something that the cryptomarket has been anticipating since the shift in policies in key jurisdictions including South Korea, where KYC and Anti-money laundering procedures are already in effect.
For the Bitcoin bulls, it was another disappointment, with Bitcoin failing to gain momentum, as investor caution continues to leave Bitcoin and the broader cryptomarket in the hands of the crypto bears.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up 0.41% to $6,275.5, with Bitcoin recovering from a start of the day morning low $6,230.3 to take a run at $6,300 levels with a morning high $6,278.6.
With Bitcoin managing to steer clear of sub-$6,200 levels and the day’s first major support level at $6,179.53, the upward move through the morning has brought the day’s first major resistance level at $6,320.33 into play, though we will expect Bitcoin to continue to face strong resistance as $6,300.
Failure to move back through the morning high to take a run at $6,300 levels could see Bitcoin take a hit later in the day to bring the day’s first major support level at $6,179.53 into play, while we would expect the second major support level at $6,108.97 to remain untested through the day.
Time is running out for Bitcoin bulls to build in a price buffer ahead of the planned roll out of rules and regulations by the G20, leaving investors with the possibility of a pullback to sub-$5,000 levels before any market rebound, the latest news on the Mueller indictments offering further justification for U.S regulators to hit the cryptomarket hard with appropriate oversight.
Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed bag, with DASH seeing the heaviest losses early on, down just 0.79%, while Litecon and Stellar’s Lumen were the front runners in the early part of the day, each up 1% for the morning.

Upstart(NASDAQ:UPST) is revolutionizing lending with its cutting-edge approach to assessing creditworthiness. By leveraging AI and machine learning, the company can analyze applicants’ profiles to determine their scores more accurately and quickly. Of course, rising interest rates mean that Upstart may not be able to approve as many applicants. However, the ones approved are likely to have great credit score potential and a much lower risk of default. It’s a win for both lenders and borrowers.
Moreover, its products and services are unprecedented, its market reach expanded rapidly, and it officially joined the ranks of some of the most successful companies in its niche last year. These numbers were bolstered by amazing profits, which helped propel Upstart even further. Though lately, the business hasn’t been as busy as it once was, Upstart is able to lean on its multiple-sector lending activities to bring stability back into the equation.

It is the first major US bank to take the step. According to an internal memo, the company enabled its advisors to take orders to buy and sell five cryptocurrency products – four from Grayscale Investments and one from Osprey Funds, earlier this week. Mary Callahan Erdoes, JP Morgan Asset & Wealth Management’s CEO, admitted recently that the bank was still debating if cryptocurrencies were an asset class or not. “A lot of our clients say that’s an asset class and I want to invest,” she said. “Our job is to help them to put their money where they want to invest. It’s a very personal thing. “We don’t have Bitcoin as an asset class per se, and time will tell whether it has a store of value. But the volatility that you see in it today, it just has to play itself out over time.” The move marks a milestone in the bank’s approach to cryptocurrencies. In 2017, CEO Jamie Dimon threatened to fire employees who traded Bitcoin. He has also labelled Bitcoin a “fraud” saying that “governments are going to crush it one day” and “if you’re stupid enough to buy it, you’ll pay the price for it”.",32333.15,0.03,32346.76,0.07,32407.01,0.26,32409.99,0.27,32323.78

The digital currency, which has exploded by more than 1,300% since its 2020 bear-market lows, continues to grab Wall Street's attention as it reaches new milestones. On Friday, Bitcoin prices eclipsed the $55,000 mark and finished regular trading hours at $55,397. (Bitcoin trades 24 hours a day; prices reported here are as of 4 p.m. each trading day.)

26930,2018-04-13 16:49:00,Bright Spots Emerging in Solar Despite Falling Installations,"Last year, for the first time this decade, the solar industry installed fewer megawatts than it did in the year before. According toGTM Research, 10,608 MW of solar power generation was installed in 2017 -- enough to power 1.74 million homes -- but down significantly from 15,128 MW in 2016.
The decline was driven by a number of factors from national policy to company-specific challenges, some of which may impact the industry for the next few years. But there are already some bright spots emerging that solar investors will want to keep an eye on.
Image source:GTM Research.
You can see in the chart above that the outlier in the long-term solar installation trendline is 2016, not 2017. That was in large part because 2016 was originally going to be the final year of the solar investment tax credit (ITC), a subsidy that allows project owners to get a 30% tax credit based on an installations' value. It's a subsidy the industry relies on to make solar projects economical, so when it was set to expire there was a rush to build solar projects.
TheITC subsidy was extended late in 2015, but that didn't stop installations from falling off a cliff in 2017. Large solar projects take years of planning, so the extension was too late to slow the rush of projects being built to hit the old 2016 deadline.
In short, there was a (well-planned) mad rush to build utility-scale solar projects in the U.S. in 2016, and 2017 was a natural retreat from that surge. That explains the utility-scale solar decline you see above, which accounts for most of the decline year over year. But residential and commercial solar could be bright spots, and as investors, that's where I think there are some interesting opportunities.
Image source: Getty Images.
Residential solar installations took a step backward in 2017, declining by 16% to 2,227 MW. It was the first time this decade that residential solar installations had fallen, but digging into the numbers the decline isn't all that surprising. The biggest drop in installations came in California, which accounted for half of the decline. The state is ending traditional net metering for rooftop solar (where solar customers would only pay for the net energy they use) and moving to time-of-use (TOU) rates, which are less favorable to solar homeowners. For example, rates are generally lower mid-day when the sun is out and higher in the evening when the sun is going down. The effect is lower compensation for the electricity sent to the grid, making it harder to justify rooftop solar. But that's not the only reason residential solar declined.
In 2016, it became clear that the most interested customers had already bought in, so sales and marketing costs were starting to rise to unsustainable levels. The three biggest residential solar installers in the country --Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA),Sunrun(NASDAQ: RUN), andVivint Solar(NYSE: VSLR)-- all talked about focusing more on profitability and potentially foregoing growth for profits. That's exactly what we saw in 2017.
Tesla took the biggest step backward,installing just 87 MW of solar in the fourth quarter of 2017, down 57% from its peak in Q2 2016. Tesla is lowering sales costs by eliminating most of its traditional door-to-door sales teams, but it's also just shrinking its solar ambitions. You can't grow a solar company by shrinking staff, which is exactly what Tesla is doing.
Vivint Solar's installations fell 17.3% to 183.8 MW in 2017 as the company contracted the number of markets it served and focused on higher-value customers. The strategy appears to be working with revenue up 98% in 2017 to $268.0 million and gross profit swinging from a $38.8 million loss in 2016 to a $37.7 million profit in 2017. Sometimes smaller is better in solar energy.
Interestingly, Sunrun was the one growth story among installers, increasing deployments by 15% to 323.3 MW in 2017 and taking over the top market share position from Tesla. Sunrun benefited from Tesla and Vivint Solar shrinking, allowing it to leverage its network of third-party installers to grow. Sunrun builds some of the solar systems it counts as deployments but doesn't install all of them. Rather it offers financing and design tools to regional installers who were eager to grow their businesses in 2017. That's where the company's growth came from.
In residential solar, there are some bright spots despite the decline in installations in 2017. Vivint Solar is making more money than it did a year ago and Sunrun is growing on the back of regional installers it partners with. Amid the industry's decline, these two companies look like they're building winning strategies.
Utility and residential solar had a tough time in 2017, but one segment that had a great year is commercial solar. These are solar installations on rooftops of warehouses, big-box retailers, or even small community solar developments that may be near your neighborhood. According to GTM Research, commercial solar installations jumped 28% in 2017 to 2,147 MW and with corporate interest in renewable energy growing, I see no sign of the momentum slowing down.
The one company to watch in commercial solar isSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR), who holds the #1 market share position and offers a flexible set of solutions for customers from rooftop solar to carports and ground mounted solutions. SunPower doesn't break out U.S.-only commercial sales, but globally it sold 426 MW of commercial solar products in 2017, bigger than both Sunrun and Vivint Solar's residential businesses. The challenge is that gross margin for the year was just 9.7% in the commercial segment, well below management's target of mid-teen margins. If SunPower can increase profitability on its #1 market share position in commercial solar this could be a great business long-term, but it has yet to live up to its financial promise.
While 2017 was a down year for solar, the pipeline is filling back up with big projects. GTM Research says the contracted pipeline of utility-scale solar projects is 16,883 MW with another 26,700 MW announced and pre-contract. Those won't all be built this year, but growth should return to the large-scale solar industry in time. On a company level we're seeing evidence that momentum is returning to the utility market.First Solar, which only serves the utility-scale market, shipped just 2.7 GW of solar panels in 2017, but it booked 7.7 GW of future sales, indicating that growth will return to utility-scale solar in coming years.
Where I think investors should expect the best company performance in 2018 is residential and commercial solar. Vivint Solar and Sunrun are increasing margins and taking market share in residential solar, which is a positive sign for their businesses long-term. Growth isn't the metric I would look for to define success this year, but I would look at gross margins and even net income improvement as signs these companies are on solid footing in residential solar.
SunPower is a complex company that produces utility-scale solutions and offers residential products, but where it has the most potential is providing solar to businesses and governments around the world. If it can expand commercial segment gross margins into the mid-teens and continue to ride the wave of growth in commercial solar installations it could allow the company to put massive losses the last two years behind it and return to profitability. If that happens, the company's stock could be a big winner for investors.

That's a cool $12,000 below its Dec. 17 record high. The Fed's recent hawkish toneslowing the pace of interest rate cuts to keep inflation in checktook the wind out of crypto's sails, even as Trump's crypto-friendly pledges initially sparked a rally. Analysts are watching Bitcoin options closely, with heavy hedging signaling a potential dive to $75,000$80,000 early next year if momentum doesn't shift soon.
While the crypto market wobbled, Japanese firm Metaplanet (MTPLF) seized the moment, buying 619 BTC for $60.7 million and pushing its total holdings to nearly 1,762 BTC, worth $169.2 million. The move came hot on the heels of a successful dual-tranche bond raise. they're still up a jaw-dropping over 2000% year-to-date. With a whopping nearly 310% yield in Q4 and bold projections for a 240% revenue spike in 2024, Metaplanet is playing the long game, doubling down on Bitcoin when others are pausing.
Adding to the drama, Bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) is under the spotlight as traders wonder if it'll keep its buying streak alive heading into the year's biggest crypto options expiry on Dec. 27.

79382,2024-12-15 11:33:00,Kiyosaki warns that Boomers will be the losers once the ‘biggest crash in history’ comes,"The U.S. stock market has seen clear sailing in 2024, with the S&P 500 up an impressive 28% year-to-date, butRich Dad, Poor Dadauthor Robert Kiyosaki sees dark clouds on the horizon — and when the storm hits, it’s the one generation that will feel the brunt of it.
“BOOMERS are SOL: When the stock market bursts … BOOMERS will be BIGGEST LOSERS,” Kiyosakiposted on X.
As a boomer himself, he acknowledged that his generation has been lucky. Data supports that claim, with reports showing thatBaby Boomers​​ are likely the wealthiest generation that has ever lived.
But that streak of fortune won’t last forever, he warned. “The biggest CRASH in history is coming. Please be proactive and get rich … before the BOOMER’s go BUST.”
So, how can people prepare? Kiyosaki offered some sage advice.
“If I were a child of a BOOMER … I would nudge my parents to sell their home, stocks, and bonds now … while prices are high … before the CRASH that is coming … and buy gold, silver, and Bitcoin now … before your BOOMER mom and dad move in with you … or expect you to pay for their rising healthcare or funeral costs.”
Kiyosaki’s recommendation to invest in silver and gold is hardly surprising — he has been a vocal proponent of precious metals for decades.
In October 2023,Kiyosaki predicted, “Gold will soon break through $2,100 and then take off. You will wish you had bought gold below $2,000. Next stop gold $3,700.”
That forecast has gained traction. Gold prices surged in 2024, now standing at about $2,700 per ounce.
Silver and gold have long been considered popular hedges against inflation. The reason is simple: central banks can’t print precious metals in unlimited quantities like fiat money.
Kiyosaki revealed that he has been purchasing gold and silver mines since 1985 and now he “literally owns tons of gold and silver.”
These days, there are many ways to gain exposure to gold. You can own bullion, buy shares of gold mining companies or ETFs, or eventap into potential tax advantages with a gold IRA.
Bitcoin has been another standout performer in 2024, rising approximately 128% year-to-date.
On November 29, Kiyosaki predicted, “Bitcoin will soon break $100,000.” On December 4, the cryptocurrency surpassed that milestone, grabbing headlines worldwide.
But Kiyosaki doesn’t see $100,000 as the end of the road. In a November 24 post, he posted a bold projection: “Q: what is the price of Bitcoin in 2025? A: $500,000 according to AI.” He did not specify which artificial intelligence model informed this prediction, but the ambitious target has certainly sparked interest.
One reason Bitcoin attracts crypto enthusiasts is its built-in scarcity, often likened to digital gold. Like gold, Bitcoin can’t be printed at will by central banks. Instead, Bitcoin volume is capped at 21 million by mathematical algorithms.
Kiyosaki has warned that once Bitcoin crosses $100,000, it will become “almost impossible for the poor and middle class to catch up.”
He attributes this to the dominance of ultra-rich entities — such as corporations, banks, and sovereign wealth funds — who will be the only ones able to acquire Bitcoin in significant amounts.
“The horse will be out of the barn and running,” he wrote, urging people to act now. “Don’t let the rich get richer … without you.”
For those looking to hop on the crypto bandwagon, there are many options to buy Bitcoin, including online exchanges, brokers, and even ATMs. Be warned, they can charge up to 4% in commission fees, so look forones that charge low or even zero commissions, and always make sure you're using a legitimate platform.
“Your house is not an asset” is one of Kiyosaki’s mostwell-known ideas. “What is the definition of the word? If it puts money in my pocket, it's an asset. If my house is taking money from my pocket, it's a liability,” he explained.
TheRich Dadwebsite expands on this concept, pointing out that owning the home you live in often takes money out of your pocket in the form of mortgage payments, utilities, taxes and maintenance costs.
Rental properties, however, are a different story.
According to the website rental properties can generate significant, regular cash flow when purchased and managed wisely. Additionally, increases in rents and property values over time can create “an important supplementary revenue stream.” While all investments carry some risk, liquid assets are “generally less subject to the daily ups and downs” of the market.
Perhaps that’s why Kiyosaki once disclosed he owns 15,000 houses — strictly forinvestment purposes.
The good news is you don’t need to be as wealthy as Kiyosaki to get started in real estate investing. There are plenty of real estate investment trusts (REITs) as well ascrowdfunding platformsthat offer everyday investors access to institutional-quality property portfolios, allowing them toearn rental income without the responsibilities of being a landlord.

US stocks moved higher on Friday, paving the way for a three-day rally as both the US dollar and Treasury yields took a breather from their recent surges and moved lower.
A declining dollar is a boon for US stocks, especially multinational stocks that have high costs in the US but sell a lot of their products overseas. Meanwhile, a decline in Treasury yields often helps boost growth stocks as the cost of capital moves lower.
But the declines are relatively small when accounting for their multi-month rallies. The US dollar index is down just 1.5% from its recent cycle high of $110.70. Meanwhile, the 10-year US Treasury yield has fallen about 10 basis points from its recent high to 3.25%.
Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. ET open on Friday:
• S&P 500:4,035.01, up 0.72%
• Dow Jones Industrial Average:31,974.80, up 0.63% (200.28 points)
• Nasdaq Composite:11,980.39, up 1.00%
But even small moves lower in both the US dollar and Treasury yields could have a big impact on different asset classes, according toFairlead Strategies'Katie Stockton.

(OTCQB:SGBZ) entered into a Share Exchange and Purchase Agreement (""Agreement"") with the shareholders of CryptoCorum Ltd to acquire all of the capital shares of that company.
The CryptoCorum Ltd. Group, which consists of CryptoCorum Ltd. (Malta holding company) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Prostaker (Malta limited company) and LXCcoin (United Kingdom limited company), is the developer and promulgator of the crypto coin LXCCoin (ticker:ticker::XWBC), a virtual wallet solution, and a number of associated strategic crypto currency technology platforms. The closing of the Agreement is conditioned upon the satisfactory completion by StrategaBiz of its due diligence, regulatory and board of director approval and the completion by StrategaBiz of its ""Super 8k"" which will be filed in connection with the closing of the transaction. The estimated purchase price of approximately USD $40 million will be paid by the issuance of 10,500,000 StrategaBiz common shares; which shares will be subject to a 12 month lock-up agreement following the closing.
CEO of StrategaBiz, Mr. Brian Palm Svaneeng Mertz,commented:""Spending the last 5 months researching the Bitcoin and the virtual coin industry, I think that we have succeeded in finding and making an agreement that can turn StrategaBiz into a growth company and to establish new disruptive business areas. Crypto currencies might be the most promising investment opportunity of our age and it is my belief that the crypto coin industry has potential to change several other industries. It is our vision that StrategaBiz with the agreement made today will become a major player in the crypto coin industry.""
CEO of the CryptoCorum Ltd. Group, Mr. Henrik Ellefsen, commented:""We're excited to be able to take this necessary step forward with one more serious level for crypto currencies, of becoming a listed entity. We see the digital currency technology as a core for the future of money transactions. We plan to build trust, full transparency, and develop the most solid cryptocurrency technology in the world. We expect to join forces with many similar operations in the future, either together or side-by-side; creating the framework for a new generation of borderless money on a worldwide scale. A listed entity with broad support will make that possible.""
About StrategaBiz Inc.StrategaBiz (www.strategabiz.com) is a Delaware smaller reporting public company that has most recently focused on finding and vetting opportunities that will preserve and increase its present value.
About CryptoCorum Ltd. GroupThe LXCCoin (www.lxccoin.com) has a different business model from any other available crypto coin, by digitalizing existing funds instead of creating empty digital currency units. Every circulated LXCCoin has an asset value and a yield mechanism behind it. All cash going into the LXCCoin base asset value is being used for person to person (P2P) lending, earning interest and thereby increasing the value of the coin. The yearly interest is expected to be up to 12%. All issued LXCCoins will be held in personal wallets developed by CryptoCorum on a wallet platform.
The company runs a network of transaction nodes to support speed and transact ability of the coin. There is no ""mining"" which often incurs vast expenses in most known crypto currencies, but a ""Proof of Stake"" staking system encouraging users to participate in the transaction network with any normal computer. Costing a fraction of the transaction paradigm of mining-based coins, this makes the coin economic and eco-friendly.
To encourage the use of LXCCoins, the company is constructing its own coin ecosystem alone and with its partners, comprising P2P lending, mobile banking, money transfers and online payments and other proprietary solutions within gaming/entertainment industries that will ensure longevity and viability of the coin.
Containing around 80% Bitcoin code, the coin can be used for all digital currency purposes like all other crypto currencies; only with a much higher degree of stability as the coin price is supported by its underlying fiat value and the controlled growth in that asset value.
The LXCCoin can be traded on the Swypto Exchange (www.swypto.exchange) owned by CryptoCorum and which is built on the software formerly powering the CoinNext crypto coin exchange. The coin is also expected to become listed on other crypto currency exchanges, and will encourage and support third-party trading facilitation.

69171,2023-03-30 19:00:00,Canada’s Crypto Boom And The Energy Concerns It Raises,"In recent years, the rise of cryptocurrency mining has caused concern for those hoping for a green transition, as the sector increases its electricity use year on year, causing the energy demand in certain regions to rise rapidly. Until now, crypto production has relied mainly on electricity generated from fossil fuels, includingusing flared gasfrom operations using carbon capture and storage technologies. We are seeing an acceleration in the rollout of renewable energy projects, but some worry that if the demand for electricity continues to rise, many regions will remain dependent on fossil fuels for their power. And while states are beginning to regulate crypto production, this is a slow process, and many companies remain largely unrestricted.
In Canada, many crypto miners are moving to the region to take advantage of the country’s clean, inexpensive energy supply. The industry has boomed in certain provinces, such as British Columbia (B.C.) and Quebec. In B.C., there are seven crypto-mining projects in operation, with six more sites under development. But the need for huge amounts of electricity to run operations is attracted greater attention.
At present, B.C. has an energy surplus, which has drawn in several crypto companies. Dan Roberts, an Australian cryptocurrency entrepreneur explained, “We can build a whole industry around this. We can go into those regional towns where they've been decimated by the end of the pulp-and-paper mill … rehire local workers, retrain them, and deliver all these benefits back into the community.” So, it’s easy to see why crypto miners have moved to the region, and many locals have welcomed them as they bring jobs and economic growth.
However, the province has just introduced an 18-month moratorium on connecting new crypto-mining sites to the electric grid, causing 21 new projects to grind to a halt. These projectswould have usedthe same amount of power as 570,000 homes. The B.C. Energy Minister, Josie Osborne,believesthe moratorium will give the province the time needed to consult with the industry and ensure the region’s energy is being used effectively. Osborne worries that the surplus in B.C. may not be seen forever and that the green electricity in the region should be used in a climate-positive way. She suggests that crypto mining does not help B.C. achieve its climate goals, and ultimately offers fewer job opportunities than many other industries.
And while some crypto miners are using renewable energy in their operations, many are not. Worldwide, there is a rising concern over the greenhouse-gas emissions involved with crypto-mining. According to a University of Cambridge industry tracker, which focuses on Bitcoin, the sector’scarbon emissions are still extremely high. The tracker found that if Bitcoin continues at its current rate of mining, it will release approximately 62 megatons ofcarbon-dioxide equivalentevery year. This is comparable to the total emissions released in Serbia in 2019.
As people become more concerned over the electricity usage of crypto operations, many arecalling for greater regulation of the sector, which remains largely unregulated. Officials from the G7 are planning to discuss regulations on the cryptocurrency industry to enhance transparency and consumer protection at the next meeting in Hiroshima, Japan, in May. Cryptocurrency will also be discussed at the upcoming G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in Washington D.C., in April. At present, there is little coordination over crypto regulations, with some states or regions imposing their own restrictions on mining, but little national or international agreement.
In the EU, some progress has been seen in regulating the sector, with the EU Council presidency and the European Parliament reaching an agreement on the markets in crypto-assets (MiCA) proposal last year. MiCA provides an EU-wide regulation for the quickly evolving sector. The regulatory framework is aimed at protecting investors and preserving financial stability while allowing for innovation and fostering the attractiveness of the crypto-asset sector.
While most action has been taken at the state level in the U.S.,such as in New York, this could soon change. In Biden’s most recent budget blueprint for 2024, heproposeda new tax on electricity use for crypto mining. If the budget is approved, this could mean a30 percent tax on mining operations, to be phased in over three years. This responds to concerns over the environmental impact of the industry.
It is clear that the electricity demands of crypto mining are high, whether the energy comes from fossil fuels or renewable sources. At a time when the world is trying to curb its energy usage and undergo a green transition, this is of high concern to those managing the energy sector. However, to date, there is little international coordination on crypto regulation. But, as some regions come to agreements, such as the EU, as the U.S. looks to introduce a tax on mining, and discussions commence at the international level, it is only a matter of time until the industry faces stricter regulations.

Mentioned in the Insider report from this weekend is the fact that a Facebook spokesperson told the publication the leaked information in question stems from a vulnerability circa 2019 that has since been remedied. And while that would make the data itself a couple of years old, the team at Hudson Rock—a cyber intelligence firm that first spotted the collection of leaked data—has argued that it still boasts potential value for anyone angling for nefariously obtained login info. Initially, this particular batch of data—per Hudson Rock CTO Alon Gal—was offered for a price. Over the weekend, however, it was discovered that “the entire dataset” had been shared for free. In a statement to Complex on Monday, a Facebook spokesperson said: “This is old data that was previously reported on in 2019. We found and fixed this issue in August 2019.” Complex also reached out to a rep for Hudson Rock for additional comment and will update this post accordingly. As of late, controversies surrounding Facebook have been focused on the battle against COVID-19 misinformation on the platform. In March, Facebook announced a range of new measures aimed at limiting the spread of potentially harmful pandemic-related content. In the same press release, CEO Mark Zuckerberg also expressed his personal support of vaccines as a safe and effective way to eventually put the pandemic behind us.

While many other miners have beenin survival modeduring the crypto bear market – dealing with not just falling prices, but also surging energy costs – CleanSpark has notably been a buyer of assets at seemingly low prices. With its latest purchase, the company has now acquired more than 26,500 mining rigs in recent months.
The price of $15.50 per terahash is relatively low as mining machines of that efficiency are currently selling at $24.26 per terahash,according to datafrom mining-services firm Luxor Technologies.
On Monday, liquidity-strapped miner Argo Blockchain (ARBK)said it soldabout the same number of mining rigs as CleanSpark bought.
CleanSpark has also been a recent buyer of data-mining centers, including two facilities in the state of Georgia, where the company mainly operates.
Last week, CleanSparkboosted its estimatefor its year-end hashrate, or computing power, by 10%.

What Happened: “People throwing away good and bad. Typical index fund behavior,” Cramer wrote on X, specifically highlighting concerns about small-cap stocks’ performance. “And all of those people who loved the Small Caps (the Russell 2000?) now what??”

The market reaction came after Powell announced a 25-basis-point rate cut to 4.25%-4.5%, while signaling only two potential rate cuts in 2025 – fewer than thefour projected in September.
The selloff was broad and deep, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as tracked by theSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF(NYSE:DIA) plunging 2.48% to close at 42,326, marking its worst one-day drop since September 2022.
The S&P 500 index — tracked by theSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSE:SPY) fell 2.9% to 5,872, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, tracked byInvesco QQQ Trust(NASDAQ:QQQ), dropped 3.6% to 21,209.
Small-cap stocks, as measured by theiSharesRussell 2000ETF(NYSE:IWM), bore the brunt of the selling pressure, tumbling 4.4% to 2,231, completely erasing their post-election gains.

28892,2018-04-26 18:34:00,Qualcomm Reportedly Just Beat Back MediaTek,"According to a new report fromDigiTimes, which often posts accurate information about smartphone supply chain machinations, wireless chip vendorMediaTekhad been ""optimistic that its gross margin and revenues would pick up drastically during the second quarter of 2018.""
That optimism was fueled by the expectation that top Chinese smartphone vendors Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo -- which collectively controlled an estimated 46% of the China smartphone market in the fourth quarter of 2017 -- were set to adopt MediaTek's latest Helio P60 applications processor.
Unfortunately for MediaTek, wireless chip giantQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM)will be launching its next-generation Snapdragon 700-series smartphone processors ""at highly competitive pricing ahead of schedule in May,"" according to DigiTimes, which says its anonymous sources have said that Chinese smartphone vendors ""significantly cut their orders with MediaTek before turning to Qualcomm.""
Let's go over some of the investment implications for Qualcomm if these rumors are true.
Image source: Qualcomm.
Although MediaTek develops capable products, the reality is that Qualcomm tends to be at least a step ahead of its smaller rival in terms of technology capability.
Qualcomm's cellular modem technology tends to be superior to MediaTek's, which is several generations behind Qualcomm's best in terms of features and capabilities, and Qualcomm leverages its expertise as a major vendor of chips for premium smartphones to strengthen the capabilities of its high-end, mid-range, and even low-end chips.
That technology superiority pays off for Qualcomm because the smartphone market is cutthroat, and smartphone vendors often don't want to put themselves at a competitive disadvantage by using inferior chips.
Since Qualcomm has such a strong technology position in its core wireless chip business, I don't think Qualcomm investors should worry that the company will lose significant share to MediaTek or other smaller wireless chip makers anytime soon. In fact, there's a good chance that Qualcomm can continue to gain share at the others' expense.
The real problems for Qualcomm's chip business are the following:
1. A slowing overall smartphone market.
2. Increased vertical integration by high-end smartphone manufacturers.
There's not much Qualcomm can do about a slowing smartphone market and that's just a fact of life that the company and its stockholders will have to accept. The second risk is that some of Qualcomm's key customers will choose to either vertically integrate (i.e., make their own chips), or that those Qualcomm customers that already have internal chip efforts will displace Qualcomm further from their product lines.
Key Qualcomm customerSamsunguses both Qualcomm chips as well as its own home-grown processors in its flagship smartphones. Huawei, too, seems to be shifting its product lines increasingly toward its own internally developed Kirin processors and away from Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips.
Even Xiaomi, a company that has benefited tremendously from Qualcomm's work in both chips and reference designs, is trying tobuild its own chips.
Considering that much of the industry's smartphone volume is consolidating to just a handful of vendors, and considering those vendors are going to try their hardest to find any and all points of differentiation as they battle for market share in a slowing overall industry, vertical integration continues to be a significant risk to Qualcomm's business.
The onus is now on Qualcomm to continue building technology that's compelling enough that the competition can't build anything that matches it, let alone beats it, for the foreseeable future.

As the company wrote in theannouncement, the new bitcoin card operates “in the same way as a traditional prepaid card,” enabling online and in-store crypto purchases on a number of services includingAmazon,Netflix, as well as tuition fees, or medical bills, among others. With that, users can also cash out from “any of the 2 million” automatic teller machines (ATMs), with funds converted automatically to local currencies.
Crypterium has managed to deliver 3,736 Crypterium Cards to around 70 countries in the first week after the launch of the solution, citing “booming demand” amid the current BTC price surge and nascentbull market.
While the majority of card orders have come from theUnited States, the firm also noted a significant demand from the Asia-Pacific region, withAustraliaranking third by orders. Exceptional demand, in particular, came from countries with weak local currencies and unstable economies.
Steven Parker, former General Manager of global payment giant Visa, said that these impressive numbers reflect the actual global demand for a “stable debit card” that provides equal status to crypto and traditional currencies in terms of payments.
On June 11, U.S.-basedcrypto exchangeandwalletserviceCoinbaselaunchedits Visa debit card in sixEuropeancountries, enabling customers to sync their cards directly to their Coinbase accounts and withdraw fiat currencies from ATMs.
Earlier this week, Cointelegraphreportedthat the total number of global bitcoin ATMs (BTMs) has reached 5,000.

After a 12 percent pullback, the bitcoin price is still up nearly $2,000 in the past 30 days (source: coinmarketcap.com)
While many technical analysts have warned against the strong possibility of a pullback occurring in the near-term, which remains probable considering the 110 percent year-to-date gain of the dominant crypto asset, one trader says bitcoin is much more bullish than it currently seems.
From April to June, the bitcoin price has surged from $4,100 to $9,000 by well over two-fold within a two-month span.
Subsequent to such an abrupt upside movement, a pullback is typically expected given the historical performance of bitcoin.
Throughout the past five years, the bitcoin price has tended to pullback by 30 to 40 percent on average after seeing extended rallies supplemented with strong momentum and volume.

The SEC will return the lion’s share of the $125 million-court ordered fine paid by Ripple last year, according to aTuesday X postfrom Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty, keeping just $50 million and returning the $75 million balance to Ripple.
The proposed settlement, which is subject to commissioner and court approval, comes just a week after the SEC agreed to dropits appealof U.S. District Court judge Analisa Torres’ 2023 ruling that Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP to retail exchanges did not violate federal securities laws. Torres found that only Ripple’s institutional sales violated securities laws, ordering Ripple to pay the $125 million fine. Though hefty, the fine was a mere fraction of the nearly $2 billion in civil penalties, disgorgement and prejudgement interest the SEC initially requested.
As part of the pending settlement agreement, Ripple has agreed to drop its cross-appeal of the SEC’s appeal. Alderoty also said that the SEC will ask the court to lift the standard injunction imposed against Ripple.
XRPjumped 1.5% higher in the minutes following the news before paring some of the gains, changing hands at around $2.47 recently. The token was down 0.5% over the past 24 hours, in line with bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index's performance.

15644,2018-01-28 20:18:00,Better Buy: Intrexon Corporation vs. Celgene,"Two very different companies are hoping to make their mark in cell therapy.Intrexon Corporation(NYSE: XON)formed its Precigen subsidiary last year to develop gene and cell therapies.Celgene(NASDAQ: CELG)recently announced its acquisitionofJuno Therapeutics(NASDAQ: JUNO), a move that puts the big biotech front and center in the cell therapy arena.
Neither stock performed well in 2017, though. Celgene's share price tumbled nearly 10%. Intrexon stock collapsed, sinking more than 50%. But which of these two biotech stocks is the better buy now? Here's how Intrexon and Celgene compare.
Image source: Getty Images.
There's really only one argument in favor of buying Intrexon stock: the potential of the company's technologies. And what a variety there is in the technologies that Intrexon is developing.
Intrexon's Trans Ova subsidiary focuses on use of genetics in breeding cattle. Another subsidiary, Oxitec, works on biological solutions to control insect populations. Intrexon's Viagen group targets genetic preservation and cloning technologies. Yet another subsidiary, Exemplar Genetics, develops custom miniature swine models for use in medical and genetic research. Perhaps the most unusual business for Intrexon is BioPop, which uses synthetic biology in creating artwork, children's toys, and novelty goods.
The company is also involved in a couple of joint ventures that use Intrexon's natural gas bioconversion platform. These joint ventures are working on producing biofuels, lubricants, and industrial chemicals.
But in Intrexon CEO Randal Kirk's presentation earlier this month at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, the primary subject discussed was the company's efforts in developing gene-based therapies. Intrexon's Precigen subsidiary has partnered withZiopharm Oncologyto research CAR-T therapies delivered at point of care.
It's this CAR-T program that could hold the greatest potential for Intrexon. CAR-T is very promising in treating several types of cancer, but there are some drawbacks currently, including high costs and delays in treatment resulting from the need for centralized manufacturing. Intrexon hopes to address these issues using non-viral-based gene transfer.
If the company succeeds, its stock should skyrocket. However, there's still a long way to go.
Investors can pretty much take their pick of reasons to buy Celgene. Let's start with its current products. Revlimid was theNo. 2 best-selling drug in the world last year. Sales for the blood cancer drug continue to enjoy strong momentum. Celgene also claims a couple of other fast-growing blockbuster drugs in Pomalyst and Otezla. In addition, the biotech has a near-blockbuster with cancer drug Abraxane.
These big winners have generated a nice cash flow for Celgene that enabled the company to build up an impressive pipeline with significant potential. Celgene anticipates FDA approval for ozanimod in treating relapsed multiple sclerosis in the second half of 2018. Market research firm EvaluatePharma predicts that ozanimod will rank among thefive biggest new drugs launched this year.
Ozanimod is just the tip of the iceberg, though. Celgene believes that it will launch nine other potential blockbusters by 2022. These include luspatercept, which targets treatment of beta-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, and multiple myeloma candidate bb2121. Luspatercept is being developed in partnership withAcceleron Pharma, while Celgene partnered withbluebird bioon bb2121.
Then there's the acquisitions. Celgene reeled off two significant buyouts within a period of 15 days in January. First, the company announced that it was buying Impact Biomedicines, picking up fedratinib, a drug that is being evaluated in clinical studies for treating myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. Second was the previously mentioned acquisition of Juno, which gives Celgene a potentially best-in-class CAR-T therapy with JCAR017.
Aside from Celgene's tremendous growth from its current products and its solid pipeline, there is one other reason to buy the stock -- valuation. Celgene shares trade at only 12 times expected earnings. With the biotech likely to grow earnings per share by close to 20% annually over the next few years, Celgene looks like a bargain right now.
I had to think long and hard about the decision between these two stocks -- for maybe a nanosecond. Celgene is definitely the better pick, in my opinion.
Celgene made over $6 billion in profits last year. That's more than three times Intrexon's market cap. Celgene took its licks in 2017 due to a late-stage clinical setback and lowering its outlook. However, the big biotech appears to be poised for a rebound this year.
There's a chance that Intrexon will be successful with its technologies. But with Celgene, I think there's a strong likelihood of success. That difference makes Celgene the better buy.

Seattle-based e-commerce giantAmazonhas launched a pilot program selling 3-D printed consumer goods. That’s great news for businesses in the space, but it’s also helpful for the fashion-forward crowd. You can pick up things like aniPhone case, abelt buckle, or abraceleton the platform.
The Amazon.com platform for 3-D printed goods is “appealing to independent designers who’ve told us they want access to a large consumer market,” Colin Klayer of 3-D printing service 3DLT said in a statement.

3DLTis one of the companies invited by Amazon to participate in itspilot program. Founded in 2012, it's a marketplace for designers to sell blueprints for 3-D printed goods and connect with larger 3-D printing shops. It's also a place for consumers to buy designs and 3-D printed objects.
While the consumer-goods pilot program is another step for Amazon into the 3-D printing world, it’s not its first. In June of 2013, Amazon started selling 3-D printers and related supplies.

“When it was announced that Amazon would begin selling 3-D printers and supplies last summer, the industry heralded it as a defining moment, a clear indication that 3-D printing was going mainstream,” said John Hauer, CEO of 3DLT, in a statement. “We think the decision to sell 3-D printed products sends an even bigger message. Consumer products are the next frontier.”
3DLT said it was told by Amazon that five or six other companies would be participating in the program. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

30752,2018-05-08 20:54:00,3 Takeaways From the Dunkin' Brands Earnings Report,"Dunkin' Brands(NASDAQ: DNKN)is shrinking. The on-the-go coffee-and-doughnut chain announced quarterly results this past week that included a rare drop in sales at its existing locations.
That decline wasn't as bad it might seem at first glance, though. And it was offset by healthy gains in the company's store base that keep the company right on track with its long-term expansion plans.
Let's take a closer look at the results.
Image source: Getty Images.
Revenue growth dipped into negative territory, with comparable-store sales falling 0.5% versus a 1% increase last quarter. The business saw a slight uptick in average spending thanks to Dunkin's popular breakfast sandwich lineup. But that boost was offset by declining traffic .
By comparison,Starbucks' comps rose 2% on flat customer traffic in the U.S.McDonald's, meanwhile, led the industry with its 5.5% comps gain even as customer traffic declined slightly.
Dunkin' Brands was pinched by the same industry slowdown that has pushed Starbucks' comps lower in the past year. It also had to deal with unusually harsh winter storm conditions that, because of its geographic concentration in the northeast, had a major impact on its business. In fact, executives estimate that without the weather issues, comps would have been slightly positive for the quarter.
The chain also lost business due to its menu simplification rollout that, while projected to increase sales and reduce costs in the long run, hurt this quarter's results. Based on test-market trends, the company found that the new menu yielded a 1% sales decline early on that turned into a 1% increase later. Thus, Dunkin's growth trends likely held close to recent trends after accounting for temporary factors like weather and menu changes.
CEO Nigel Travis and his team believe they can double their U.S. store footprint from its current 9,000-unit mark. They made progress on that score this quarter by adding 56 locations to keep the chain among the fastest-growing retailers in the casual dining sector.Domino's Pizza, which has a similarly small average store footprint, added 31 locations to its base in the same period. Dunkin' Brands has a much larger long-run opportunity ahead given that it has little presence in the western two-thirds of the country.
Source: Dunkin' Brands' investor presentation.
Dunkin' Brands affirmed its full-year outlook that calls for comps to rise by about 1%, or roughly the same pace as in 2017. An extra 275 stores launched in 2018, meanwhile, should push that sales growth figure into the low to mid-single digits overall.
That forecast doesn't imply robust market share gains, given that national rivals like Starbucks and McDonald's are growing at a faster rate today. Yet it would translate into accelerating sales gains for Dunkin' Brands over the next few quarters as the weather warms up and its menu simplification starts paying dividends.
That speed-up, including a continued uptick in afternoon traffic, should allow the chain to posthealthy earningsthis year despite aggressive competition in the coffee, breakfast, and afternoon snack space. Investor returns will be further bolstered by agrowing dividendand an aggressive stock repurchase plan.

London-based Balderton sold 27 million shares for £205.2 million and West Coast Capital Assets sold 4 million for £30.4 million in a secondary issue of shares, the company said today.
Other shareholders who were big backers prior to the IPO also sold, taking the total of shares changing hands up to £250 million.
The sales were made due to exceptional demand from the market. Institutional investors had been keen to get access to more stock, so the big pre-IPO investors agreed to sell more.
Watch: Bitcoin's Stumble and the Bond Market's Moment of Truth
In a statement outlining the sale plan last night, IHG said it was hoping its shareholders would sell around £200 million of stock, but the issue was seven times oversubscribed, so they sold an extra £50 million.
All were priced at 760p a share.
Balderton has made outstanding returns on its investments in the health and beauty retailer, which also runs web operations for third party retailers.
The sale marked a temporary lifting of Balderton and West Coast’s 360 day “lockup period”, during which they are banned from selling stock.

For the first time in its history, the S&P 500 topped 5,600. A renewed bid for megacaps drove the US equity benchmark to its longest rally since November, with Nvidia Corp. up over 2.5% and Apple Inc. climbing on news it aims to ship 10% more new iPhones after a bumpy 2023. Treasuries remained fairly stable after a strong $39 billion sale of 10-year bonds. Swaps are pricing in two Fed cuts in 2024 — and higher chances the first comes in September.
As Wall Street geared up for the consumer-price index, Powell said the Fed doesn’t need inflation below 2% before cutting rates, while adding officials still have more work to do. He noted the labor market has cooled “pretty significantly.” Powell cited a “good ways to go” on the balance-sheet runoff, and said commercial real estate doesn’t threaten financial stability.
“The key takeaway from his testimony is the Fed’s assessment of the balance of risks is shifting in ways that – if supported and sustained by incoming data – will deliver a rate cut in September,” said Krishna Guha at Evercore.
The S&P 500 climbed 1% — up for a seventh straight day — to notch its 37th record this year. Gold and silver mining stocks rallied on Fed easing bets. Banks underperformed. Google parent Alphabet Inc. has shelved efforts to acquire HubSpot Inc., according to people with knowledge of the matter.
US 10-year yields fell two basis points to 4.28%. Bank of England Chief Economist Huw Pill said the timing of a rate cut is still an “open question,” prompting traders to pare bets on August cut. Oil rose as a US holiday boosted demand for gasoline and jet fuel.
“Markets remain remarkably calm despite the flood of data this week, including Fed Chair Powell’s testimony, CPI/PPI reports, and the beginning of earnings season,” said Mark Hackett at Nationwide.
The so-called core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs and is seen as a better measure of underlying inflation, is expected to rise 0.2% in June for a second month. That would mark the smallest back-to-back gains since August — a pace more palatable for Fed officials.
“June’s CPI report looks to be another ‘very good’ report that should boost the FOMC’s confidence about the inflation trajectory,” said Anna Wong at Bloomberg Economics. “That should set the stage for the Fed to start cutting rates in September.”
A survey conducted by 22V Research shows 55% of investors expect the market reaction Thursday’s CPI to be “risk-on,” 16% said “risk-off” and 29% “mixed/negligible.”
“There is optimism about inflation generally,” said Dennis DeBusschere at 22V, adding that the survey also showed investors think “CPI is on a Fed-friendly glide path.”
Meantime, some trading desks say investors should gear up for a potential break in the eerie calm that’s recently descended on the market.
The options market is betting the S&P 500 Index will move 0.8% in either direction after Thursday’s report on consumer prices, based on the price of that day’s at-the-money straddles, according to Stuart Kaiser, Citigroup’s head of US equity trading strategy.
If it happens, that would be the biggest move for the index since June 12, the day of the last CPI print and interest-rate decision.
Market volatility may pick up in the days and weeks ahead, amid US political uncertainty, comments from the Fed chair, and the start of the second-quarter earnings season, according to Mark Haefele at UBS Global Wealth Management.
For the first time since 2022, S&P 500 earnings may not be laser-focused on just technology, with the quarter’s success hanging on everything aside from the megacap tech heavyweights that have driven stocks to all-time highs, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategists led by Gina Martin Adams.
“While forecasts for the ‘Magnificent Seven’ remain robust, their earnings are expected to slow in the second quarter — just as the rest of the S&P 500 may finally post their first year-on-year growth in at least five quarters,” they noted.
The Magnificent Seven may have already peaked, while the remaining S&P 500 stocks may post their first earnings expansion in at least six quarters, the strategists concluded.

Indeed, the U.S. central bank has recognized Bitcoin as potentially being a “salient risk” to the market at-large.
Since the 2009 Great Recession, the Federal Reserve has been constantly on the prowl for detecting where the next economic meltdown might occur. Congress and the Obama Administration passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which made it a law for the Fed to run these stress tests moving forward.
According to a new policy rule for the Federal Reserve, studying historical patterns is not enough to figure out where the next market panic might break out. Instead, the central bank is heeding recommendations to “consider extraordinary shocks, such as a war with North Korea, the collapse of the Bitcoin market, or major losses caused by trader misconduct.”
According to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System’s newestFinal Rule:
Similarly, a commenter expressed support for the incorporation in the stress test of shocks unlike those already experienced, since firms should be prepared to withstand events beyond those already endured. The commenter recommended that the Board consider extraordinary shocks, such as a war with North Korea, the collapse of the Bitcoin market, or major losses caused by trader misconduct, in its scenarios.",3829.24,-0.13,3823.94,-0.27,3827.7,-0.17,3830.58,-0.1,3834.28

80845,2023-04-17 10:01:57,HIVE Blockchain Provides March 2023 Production Update with over 3 Exahash of Production,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 17, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. (TSX.V:HIVE) (Nasdaq:HIVE) (FSE:HBFA.F) (the “Company” or “HIVE”) is pleased to announce the production figures from the Company’s global Bitcoin operations for the month of March 2023, with 282 Bitcoin produced, and a current BTC HODL balance of approximately 2,310 (as of March 31, 2023). On average the Company has continued to operate above 3 Exahash (“EH/s”) throughout March 2023 (all amounts in US dollars, unless otherwise indicated).
Summary Overview:
• HIVE produced 282 Bitcoin in the month of March 2023, from ASIC and GPU mining operations, representing an average of 91 Bitcoin Per Exahash, with an average hashrate of 3.09 EH/s;
• HIVE Produced an average of 9.1 BTC per day in March 2023;
• HIVE has received over 5,600 BuzzMiners in its data centers, all of which are operating as of today;
• HIVE ended the month with 3.36 EH/s of mining capacity, including ASIC and GPU BTC hashrate;
• HIVE sold all of the Bitcoin earned from our GPU mining hashrate payouts.
March 2023 Production Figures
Frank Holmes, Executive Chairman of HIVE stated, “We are very happy to be producing 282 Bitcoin while difficulty has reached an all-time high. Additionally, our average daily HPC income has increased by 14% on average month over month, from February to March.”
Aydin Kilic, President & CEO of HIVE noted “We have successfully completed our deployment of our first buildout of the HIVE BuzzMiner, and we’ve mined at an average hashrate of over 3 Exahash for the month of March. Additionally, our GPU fleet is generating approximately 16% more revenue per megawatt hour than most Bitcoin mining ASICs. We strive to mine for maximum profit, utilizing energy as a resource for cash flow.”
The Company’s total Bitcoin production in March 2023 was:
• 282 BTC produced;
• 9.1 BTC produced per day on average;
• 3.36 Exahash of BTC Hashrate as of March 31, comprised of 3.06 Exahash of ASIC BTC hashrate and 0.3 Exahash of GPU BTC equivalent Hashrate;
• Monthly average of 3.09 Exahash, which is equal to 91 Bitcoin per Exahash, comprised of an average of 2.88 Exahash of ASIC mining capacity and average of 210 PH/s of Bitcoin GPU mining capacity during the month;
• This represents a 12% month over month increase in average hashrate (February was 2.75 EH/s average hashrate).
Bitcoin Global Network Mining Difficulty Is Volatile
Network difficulty factors are a significant variable in the Company’s gross profit margins.   The Bitcoin network difficulty was 43.1T as at March 1, and increased to 46.8T as at March 31, reaching an all-time high. Accordingly, Bitcoin mining difficulty ended the month about 9% higher than the beginning of the month.
The Bitcoin Network Difficulty is a publicly available statistic, that reflects the total number of Bitcoin miners online and is important in analyzing a company’s gross profit margins, and number of Bitcoin produced. This data is available on many websites, here is one citation:https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/difficulty
As more people mine Bitcoin (difficulty increases), the daily Bitcoin block reward which presently is fixed at 900 Bitcoin per day, gets split amongst more miners; thus each miner receives a smaller portion of the block reward. Conversely, as Bitcoin prices fall, many miners may lose money, and power down, thus taking their hashrate off the network, causing Network Difficulty to decrease.
Those miners with the lowest costs of production; by virtue of having more efficient machines and/or lower energy costs, are able to continue their production during these volatile cycles. Not all miners will continuously mine during the month, as a result some miners will produce less Bitcoin than expected, relative to their advertised hashrate. For the foregoing reasons, HIVE will self-curtail part of its operations if the unhedged spot energy prices are uneconomical, thereby leaving part of its total gross hashrate unutilized.
All Bitcoin miners are striving to use the most efficient Bitcoin ASIC chips, and we are happy that we have been able to upgrade our global fleet during this crypto market downturn.

According to theJanuary survey,

All Eyes on Ether as Bitcoin Pushes Down?
Good Morning Asia,
Crypto is starting the trading day in Asia fairly flat after apromising U.S. Consumer Price Indexpushed bitcoin above $28,000.
Bitcoin is now trading at $27,618, according to CoinDesk market data, which makes it effectively flat. Ether is down 0.4% to $1,838.
Katie Stockton, Founder and Managing Partner of Fairlead Strategies, said during a recent appearance on CoinDesk TV that overall the crypto market likes the lower CPI numbers but don’t expect price appreciation yet.
“From a technical perspective, the market does seem to like it, we're seeing a positive reaction. But really, the action is somewhat insignificant in terms of where both bitcoin and Ether have traded up late,” she said. “They recently broke down below their 50-day moving averages.""
Stockton expects Bitcoin to pull back to its base breakout point of about $25,200. However, she still sees an upward trend in the intermediate term.
This lower price point should serve as a nice entry point for new investors, she argues.
Stockton also sees a short-term setback for Ether as it too, has moved out its 50-day moving average. However, she predicts Ether might outperform bitcoin in the short term.
""We anticipate a downside for Ether, regardless of today's activity, with a support level around $1,755,” she said. “This could provide a natural point for stabilization as oversold conditions may yield a rebound.""

An Asset Market in Search of a Good Story
Banking substitute? Inflation hedge? Gold alternative?
Bitcoin has yet to find a new foundation that drives the price from its weeks-long range roughly between $25,000 and $30,000, Brent Xu, CEO and co-founder of Web3 bond-market platform Umee, said on CoinDesk TV’s “All About Bitcoin” program.
“Bitcoin is trying to find its next narrative,” Xu said.
Bitcoin’s price seesawing on Wednesday encapsulated its vulnerability to events in recent weeks. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose on a mildly favorable Consumer Price Index (CPI) that showed inflation rising a less-than-expected 4.9% in April. But BTC sank around midday on internet rumors of a $320 million U.S. government bitcoin sell-off before rebounding as markets shrugged off the hearsay.
Xu noted that the price run-ups tied to a mini-run of U.S. bank failures in April and earlier this month had failed to spur long-lasting price momentum.
“We saw a bunch of banks get destroyed, and there's this narrative building that bitcoin will be a new banking system,” he said. “Unfortunately, that narrative is still not fully substantiated.Bitcoin is oscillating during the existing market cycles, and we haven't reached that bullish momentum cycle yet.
He added: That is likely to happen next year. For the rest of this year, we're gonna see some more price oscillation.”
Xu believes that the steady decline in inflation from a peak of 9.1% last June will allow the U.S. central bank to reconsider the steady diet of hawkish interest rate increases that Federal Reserve critics blame for the near banking meltdown and other economic ills. “There's a likelihood that we're going to see some potential cuts,” Xu said, adding that some analysts foresee interest rate cuts totaling 75 basis points (bps) in the months ahead.
“They need to take a long hard look at what all these interest rates hikes have been doing, and just the possibility of a deeper recession into the near future,” he said.
Xu said that liquidity would be important for crypto markets to thrive. Market makers Jane Street and Jump Crypto recently abandoned crypto trading in the U.S. and other firms focused or with at least a deep interest in crypto have also been scaling back their activities or threatening to move them overseas.
But Xu said that “these markets will find a way to exist, if not within U.S. borders,” and added that “there will be institutional liquidity that comes in.”
“It’s just building the right narrative. The next narrative needs to be a major innovation, like the Shanghai Shapella upgrade, or some sort of new L-2 (layer 2), or some major improvement to the bitcoin blockchain. And when we see those, we'll see more liquidity and action coming (into markets).”

69376,2022-12-05 16:41:04,3 Top Social Media Stocks to Buy That Could Trounce Twitter,"Elon Musk is generating his own news cycle again. This time, theTesla(NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO isn’t making waves for his focus on electrification. Rather, it’s the social media space that’s been upended, with his acquisition ofTwitter. With this deal in the rear-view mirror, many investors may be looking at other social media stocks to buy, as Twitter appears to be sputtering under new management.
Indeed, expectations for this takeover were high going into the closing of this transaction. Many expected Musk to streamline the business and create efficiencies that were lacking. To some extent, he’s made serious progress, slimming down the company’s headcount by around 50%.
That said, other social media stocks appear to be taking market share away from Twitter. On the advertising front, much ado has been made about Twitter losing key advertisers such asApple(NASDAQ:AAPL), paving the way for other social platforms to pick up the ad dollars that are being left on the sidelines.
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Thus, for those looking for social media stocks to buy that aren’t named Twitter, there are plenty of options. Here are three such stocks I think are worth buying right now.
[{""META"": ""PINS"", ""Meta Platforms"": ""Pinterest"", ""$122.31"": ""$24.14""}, {""META"": ""SNAP"", ""Meta Platforms"": ""Snap Inc."", ""$122.31"": ""$10.24""}]

The leading company in the social media space since social media was a thing,Meta Platforms(NASDAQ:META) remains the top choice for many investors looking at this sector.
The company’s Facebook social media ecosystem is incredible, and continues to post strong earnings each and every quarter. While active user numbers have recently declined (for the first time ever), in terms of profitability, Facebook remains among the leading companies in this space.
Meta’s primary issue is that the company has shifted its focus toward the metaverse, which has proven to be a very costly endeavor. Thus, a lack of visibility toward profit growth has some investors sitting on the sidelines.
That said, the company has been dialing back its spending in recent weeks with layoffs of 11,000 employees —13% of its workforce. In all likelihood, this gamble on the metaverse is more of a call option on this being the “next big thing,” which may not see returns for another decade. Considering that other spending is being ratcheted down, Meta is keeping the rest of its balance sheet a little safer in the meantime.

Among the top social media stocks I continue to like at these lower levels isPinterest(NYSE:PINS). The company’s stock price has been volatile this year, but despite the chop, has actually held up quite well compared to its peers.
Much of this has to do with the company’s earnings and growth prospects. On the revenue front, this current quarter’s estimated earnings stand at $883.86 million. This represents an increase of less than 5% year-over-year, leading to an overall annual revenue estimate of $2.81 billion (up 9%). Next year, the company estimates it will be able to haul in $3.24 billion,more than 15% higher compared to 2022.
Pinterest is among the leading platforms for users to share creative and other ideas via social media. It also helps users get much more organized with creative projects. It’s a platform with a loyal user base and some impressive monetization capabilities, since these users are all shoppers who don’t really know what they want yet. For brands looking to make an impression, this is the place to start.
The company’s fundamentals have remained solid, and I think will continue to provide strong profitability, even if we should be headed into a recession next year.

Rounding out this list of social media stocks to buy isSnap Inc.(NYSE:SNAP). Certainly the most speculative pick on this list, Snap (the parent company of Snapchat) has produced a social media platform that’s unique in its approach as a camera application. (All those dog-ear filters you see come from somewhere).
Although people of all age groups use social media, younger people are more active. Snapchat is extremely popular with youngsters, especially among teens. Thus, this is a company serving a target market that advertisers may pay more for, given that the expected return may be higher for younger buyers due to a longer lifetime spending trajectory.
This platform continues to grow rapidly, withdaily active users growingat a double-digit pace. However, the company’s stock price has absolutely plunged on weakening sentiment for the sector and various negative earnings surprises of late.
Despite Snap’s negative earnings profile right now, I think the company’s 77% drop year-to-date warrants a look by long-term growth investors. This is a company that’s looking very attractive for those looking to build small positions in companies that have significant upside potential right now.

14751,2014-08-13 09:45:00,Study Finds Americans Plagued by Outstanding Debt,"A disturbing new study from the Urban Institute reveals that one out of every 20 American adults on file with credit reporting agencies has at least one debt that is between 30 and 180 days past due, and that more than one in three has had a debt sent to a collections agency within the past seven years.
Lead author Caroline Ratcliffe, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, and her team of co-authors analyzed seven million credit reports from the TransUnion credit bureau and found that while credit troubles are most common in the Deep South and in Southwestern states, delinquency is a problem almost everywhere in the country.

“They are stunning numbers,” Ratcliffe said. “Debt in collections is pervasive, and it threads through nearly all communities.”
The findings suggest one reason why the country’s recovery from the Great Recession has been so slow. Personal debt is a key factor that banks and other lenders take into account both when making decisions about whether to offer credit to a consumer in the first place and when deciding what interest rate to charge.
“The important part of it is that this debt can harm people’s credit score,” said Ratcliffe. “Outstanding debt can decrease access to credit and increase the cost. To the extent that it impacts people’s access to well-priced credit it can affect whether they will be able to buy a home or get that loan to start a business.”
The impact of widespread credit problems can also have an impact that goes beyond the opportunity to purchase a home or start a business.

“Businesses base hiring decisions on credit reports,” she said, “It can impact whether people get an apartment.”
The study found that 5.3 percent of adults are currently between 30 and 180 days past due on at least one debt, and that the average amount of money they would need to bring their account back to current status is $2,258.
The reason why the number of people currently past due is so much lower than the number of people with debt in collections is the way the credit reporting system is structured. In general, a debt is classified as past due after it is 30 days late, and until it is 180 days late. Afterward, the creditor typically writes off the debt and sells it to a collections agency. Once this happens, credit bureaus classify the debt as being in collections, and it can remain on an individual’s credit report for seven years.

That means it is possible for a consumer to have no “past due” accounts at any given time, but simultaneously have multiple accounts in collections.
Ratcliffe and her colleagues were able to break down their data to the Census tract level, and what they found is that credit problems are the worst in the “West South Central” states of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. On average, 7.5 percent of adults in that region are past due on at least one debt, and 43.6 percent have a debt in collections.
Louisiana was, by far, the state with the most individuals with past due accounts. The report found 8.7 percent of Louisianans were between 30 and 180 days past due on a debt. The next worst state, Texas, had only 7.6 percent of consumers past due.

However, neither Texas nor Louisiana was the worst when it came to debt in collections. On that score, Nevada led the pack with a remarkable 46.9 percent of consumers who had at least one debt sent to a collections agency. South Carolina ran second in that category at 46.2 percent.
Utah had the smallest percentage of past due debts, at 3.4 percent of the population, and North Dakota had the smallest percentage of adults with debts in collection at 19.1 percent.
Ratcliffe offers one word of advice to consumers considering applying for credit: Check your credit report beforehand.
While most of the delinquent debt reports are accurate, she said, some aren’t. Many consumers don’t even realize they have a debt in collections until they look at their credit file.

16888,2018-02-03 00:00:00,"What to Expect When National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Reports Fourth-Quarter Results","National Oilwell Varco(NYSE: NOV)will report its fourth-quarter and full-year results early next week. The oil-field equipment company has already provided a glimpse of what to expect by providing guidance on itsthird-quarter conference calland announcing in the middle of January that the quarter should ""be at or above prior expectations."" As a result, we have a pretty good idea of what to expect from each of its business segments this quarter.
In mid-January, National Oilwell Varco announced that it would combine its rig systems and rig aftermarket segments into one reporting entity called rig technologies. Along with that announcement, the company noted that the newly combined businesses would ""exceed prior guidance."" That's a step forward, since both segments missed expectationslast quarter.
Image source: Getty Images.
One reason the former rig systems segment fell short last quarter was because $40 million to $50 million in sales got pushed into the fourth quarter. Given the company's guidance, we can expect to see that those items shipped, implying that revenue from the legacy rig systems segment should be up a bit from the $330 million it pulled in last quarter. Meanwhile, ""recent improvements in spare part bookings give us some confidence that fourth-quarter rig aftermarket results should be in line with third quarter"" (when revenue was $311 million), according to CFO Jose Bayardo on last quarter's conference call. These factors all seem to suggest that the combined segment's revenue rose to around $650 million during the quarter.
National Oilwell Varco's wellbore technologies segment was the star in the third quarter after revenue rose 13% to $693 million thanks to strong sales in North America resulting from an uptick in shale drilling. That improvement was the main reason companywide revenue rose last quarter. That said, as good as those results were, National Oilwell Varco expected even more in the fourth quarter.
Several factors fueled those expectations, including the belief that the industry needs to replenish its equipment supply after three years of underinvestment. As a result, Bayardo thought that revenue from the segment would increase by ""300 to 500basis points"" while margins would expand even more than they did in the third quarter. The company seems to have hit those targets, as it noted in last month's update that this segment's results would be ""in-line with expectations.""
The other positive last quarter was the company's completion and production systems segment, where revenue rose 5% to $682 million due to strong well completion activity in North America and the Middle East, which drove demand for its related equipment. That led Bayardo to predict on last quarter's call that, ""after several quarters in a row of strong bookings, this segment is well positioned to realize mid-single-digit percent revenue growth in the fourth quarter.""
Unfortunately, it appears as if National Oilwell Varco will miss that mark, with the company noting earlier in the year that this segment would ""fall short of guidance."" Driving that shortfall were some engineering challenges and delivery delays associated with a new product, as well as lower-than-expected orders in its process and flow technologies business.
With the expectation for better performance from two of its three business segments, National Oilwell Varco should report another quarter of improving financial results. That would continue a trend thatbegan in the fourth quarter of 2016. That said, it seems like the company is just about to hit its stride, since oil prices have recovered sharply in recent months, which should provide oil companies with the cash to buy more equipment. That suggests National Oilwell Varco's recovery could shift into higher gear this year.

47069,2018-09-16 15:46:35,This Dormant $720 Million Bitcoin Wallet Has Woken Up – But Who Owns It?,"Once again in the world of cryptocurrency, we have a mystery on our hands.
A $720 million sleeping giant has woken up after four years, with $100 million moved to Bitfinex and Binance over the course of ten days at the end of August. The bitcoin wallet contains 111,114 BTC or 0.52% of the total supply. The sudden movement of these dormant funds could have a disruptive potential in the market price action, particularly if the funds belong to one of the two possible likely candidates suggested by Reddit sleuth u/sick_silk.
The Redditor brought the movement of the funds to the attention of the crypto community by publishing a series of posts tracking each transaction in detail accompanied with graphs representing the activity.
Thefirst postwas made on 31 August and suggested that the funds may be connected to the now-defunct dark web market Silk Road which handled the trade of billions of dollars worth of contraband such as recreational and prescription drugs, illegal weapons and pornography, malware, hacking services, guides to various types of criminal activity, and other black market goods and services.
u/Sick_Silk points out:
“It seems that the owner of a huge SilkRoad related wallet is moving funds actively since 3 days, dividing it in chunks of 100 coins by subwallets.
Sick_Silk connected theoriginal addressto the Silk Road via the followingbitcointalk threadin which userassortmentofsortsconnects the dots to from an address operated by DPR (Dread Pirate Roberts AKA Ross Ulbricht, creator of the Silk Road) to the one in the Reddit post over the course of six traced transactions.
However, while the evidence connecting the funds to DPR is intriguing, u/Sick_Silk had his doubts and after another week of investigating posited the theory that the funds may well be from an old Mt Gox wallet, a view mirrored by Bitcoin security specialists WizSec.
u/Sick_Silk created custom graphs to represent the movement of the funds, with the red nodes indicating the most recent transactions (< 1 month), blue nodes indicating quite recent ones (<1 year) and green nodes indicating the older ones ( > 1 year).
The chart below represents $100 million being moved to Binance and Bitfinex, with more charts and information available in thedeep-dive poston Reddit.
Apart from being an intriguing mystery, this has real-world ramifications. u/Sick_Silk believes that the movement of funds may be at least partially responsible for the recent price decline seen in August, and whether that’s true or not, it’s certainly the case that 0.52% of the entire supply of Bitcoin is more than enough to seriously manipulate or destabilize the market. Indeed, the funds are already worth around $80 million less since the report went public.
u/Sick_Silk has yet to respond to comment requests at the time of writing, but we eagerly await the next update from our Reddit sleuth as well as other experts among the community who can tell us more about the recent resurrection of one of the largest individually-owned sums of Bitcoin in the world.

2855,2018-11-08 20:07:05,$43 Million in Bitcoin Trades Help Square Beat Q3 Earnings Estimates,"Square Cash app bitcoin Square, the merchant payment service provider which thrives on its mobile card readers and applications, has posted its third-quarter shareholder report , and it includes $43 million in bitcoin revenue. Slim Margins on Bitcoin Overall, they’ve made 51 percent more than they did last year up to this point, and revenue is 68 percent better than they did during the same quarter of last year. BTC sales are one of its smallest components, but they still represent a notable portion of total revenue — around 5 percent. They mention that their adjusted revenue figures reflect a deduction of bitcoin transaction costs, noting that: “We deduct bitcoin costs because we consider our role in the bitcoin transactions to be facilitating customer access to bitcoin. Since we only apply a small margin to the market cost of bitcoin when we sell bitcoin to customers, and we have no control over the cost of bitcoin in the market, which tends to be volatile, we believe deducting bitcoin costs is a better reflection of the economic benefits as well as the Company’s performance from the bitcoin transactions.” Actual profits on the BTC revenues were therefore roughly $500,000, about 20 percent more than what they made in the previous quarter on the same product. Square has yet to add a variety of cryptos to its offerings, but when or if it decides to do so, we expect these revenues to increase as they can likely have higher margins on cryptos that are perceived as harder to acquire using traditional means. Square on Pace to Become Leading Crypto Provider Square’s Cash App allows people to digitally transact money much like PayPal, and also allows users to invest in the most prominent cryptocurrency. They secured a patent for their payments network earlier this year, potentially locking themselves in as the premier bridge between legacy payment rails and cryptocurrencies. As CCN reported, Square brass have previously noted that cryptocurrency and BTC, in particular, is a “ transformational ” technology. Given that Square is used for many purposes besides investing in or holding BTC, it’s likely to continue growing as a premier crypto provider and gives the added benefit of exposing its massive user base to cryptocurrencies. The firm’s Cash App has more than 10 million installs on the Google Play store and provides a seamless crypto purchasing experience. In this respect, they are light years ahead of PayPal, who have yet to integrate cryptocurrency in any meaningful way, despite several notable rumors over the years . As of now, one can still not simply purchase crypto through his or her PayPal wallet, a feature that Square Cash now has.

60381,2022-10-06 12:02:32,Biometric Authentication Could Be The Perfect Solution To Tackle Cyber Attacks On Educational Institutions,"By Gita Karunakaran, Benzinga Wall, New Jersey --News Direct-- BIO-key International, Inc. The changing nature of delivering education post-pandemic has boosted cyber security awareness, and addressing its flaws has become a necessity for educational institutions. Schools and colleges were already vulnerable to cyber attacks before COVID-19, and the rise in the education sector’s reliance on online learning platforms post-pandemic may have exacerbated existing problems. Today, institutions are more susceptible than ever to disruption through ransomware and phishing attacks. Higher education institutions store vast amounts of personal information about students, faculty, and staff and keep valuable research data on file, making them particularly vulnerable to cybercrime. Cyber Security Attacks On Educational Institutions At An All-Time High Academic institutions and research organizations were the top targets globally for cyber attackers in 2021. At an average of 1,605 attacks per organization per week, this was a 75% increase from 2020, according to research by Check Point Software Technologies . Microsoft Corp. ’s (NASDAQ: MSFT) security intelligence blog highlights similar statistics , with over 80% percent of nearly 10 million malware encounters in recent months targeted at the education sector. The key attack vehicles for cyber threats in the education sector reportedly include ransomware and phishing, and such attacks could prove costly for the institutions targeted. Some examples from recent years: The University of California San Francisco (UCSF) paid $1.14 million in Bitcoin in June 2020 to recover School of Medicine data that's important to the university’s academic work. Attackers demanded $2 million in Bitcoin from New York City-based Monroe College after disabling its technology systems in July 2020. The University of Utah paid nearly $500,000 to recover data following a ransomware attack. Lincoln College , a private school based in Illinois, announced this week that it will be closing permanently after 157 years following a ransomware attack. Why Attack Educational Institutions? Many colleges and universities — especially those that rely on public funding — are ill-prepared to prevent or deal with cyber-attacks because of budgetary constraints and a lack of adequate security awareness. Reports show that more than 30% of higher education breaches are a result of students falling victim to email scams, misuse of social media, or activities relating to password sharing. A Modern Yet Simple Solution May Be Found In Biometrics BIO-key International Inc. (NASDAQ: BKYI), an Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions provider, says it may have a robust solution to tackle this problem. Story continues According to the company, educational institutions could benefit from including biometric authentication options — especially for end users such as students, who would be able to avoid password fatigue or memorizing complicated passwords. Most universities the company has dealt with use multi-factor authentication involving passwords and physical tokens or one-time passwords via mobile phones to tackle the increasing threat of cyber attacks. And although strong multi-factor authentication would always be more secure than a username and password, physical tokens or mobile phones involve a higher cost and have the risk of being misplaced, lost, or shared — resulting in downtime to reinstate access and the potential for cyber attacks to still occur, according to BIO-key. The company says that biometrics is a low-cost, easy-to-use, and secure method of authentication that could enable convenient and secure access to devices, information, applications and transactions. According to BIO-key, biometric authentication methods, specifically using Identity-Bound Biometrics, are the only methods that can truly verify the identity of the individual requesting access. It does not require the user to carry additional devices and cannot be used for unauthorized delegation or sharing of credentials. BIO-key’s signature solution PortalGuardⓇ reportedly offers both a cloud-based and on-premises multi-factor authentication solution, which is both secure and easy to use for educational institutions, covering students, staff, and faculty populations. The company says it secures access for over 200 institutions through its PortalGuard platform and has been supporting higher education for over 20 years. The platform has flexible options for single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, adaptive authentication and self-service password reset that could save money for sparsely staffed IT departments at educational institutions. Biometric verification and authentication is still new to many colleges and universities, and it may seem daunting at first for them to grasp the overall technological impact of implementing a biometric access management solution, BIO-key said. To overcome this, the company recommends starting with a smaller-scale deployment of its Identity-Bound Biometrics, such as implementing it in research labs or research areas to safeguard highly confidential resources or where work is completed on shared workstations. This would allow educational institutions to test the approach in a more controlled environment and expand to other areas over time. To learn more about implementing an IAM solution for educational institutions check out BIO-key’s higher education e-book . To learn more about BIO-key visit www.BIO-key.com . BIO-key is revolutionizing authentication and cybersecurity with biometric-centric, multi-factor identity and access management (IAM) software managing millions of users.

Shares in Japan rose despite a dive in the country’s exports. Weakness in the financial sector are pushing down shares in Australia and Hong Kong is called lower in anticipation of a reaction to city-tightened restrictions.
At 01:26 GMT,Japan’s Nikkei 225 Indexis trading 22674.73, down 21.69 or -0.10% and South Korea’s KOSPI Index is at 2190.39, down 10.80 or -0.49%.
China’s Shanghai Index is trading 3213.74, down 0.39 or -0.01% and Australia’s ASX/200 Index is at 6010.20, down 23.40 or -0.39%.
China is expected to keep itsbenchmark lending ratesteady for the third straight month at its July fixing on Monday, a Reuters survey showed, encouraged by a stronger-than-expected rebound from the coronavirus crisis.
Thirty-four traders and analysts out of 36 participants in the snap survey this week predicted no change to the one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR). The remaining two expected a marginal reduction of five basis points (bps) in both tenors.
The one-year LPR is now 3.85% after two cuts this year, while the five-year rate is at 4.65%.
Japan’s exports fellin May at the fastest pace since the global financial crisis as U.S.-bound car shipments plunged, bolstering expectations for a deeper contraction in the world’s third-largest economy this quarter.
U.S.-bound exports – Japan’s key market – halved to market the biggest annual drop since March 2009, due to more than 70% declines in shipments of cars and car parts. Japan is the world’s second-largest exporter of autos.
U.S.-bound exports fell to 588 billion Yen ($5.48 billion), the lowest since February 2009, shrinking Japan’s trade surplus with the United States to 10 billion Yen, the smallest since records began in January 1979.
Hong Kong tightened coronavirus restrictions on Sunday, with non-essential civil servants told to work from home from this week, as the global financial hub reported a record number of daily cases.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam told a news conference the city recorded more than 100 cases in the past 24 hours, the most since the pandemic took hold in late January, taking the tally close to 2,000 patients, 12 of whom have died.

65145,2021-02-08 16:36:33,Elon Musk is serious about crypto as Tesla puts $1.5 billion in bitcoin,"Elon Musk is serious about cryptocurrency.
On Monday, Musk moved fromjokey tweetsto major investments when Tesladisclosed in an SEC filingthat thecompany invested $1.5 billionin bitcoin in January, and aims “to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future.”
This amounts to 10% of Tesla's cash reserves, and is the largest corporate purchase of bitcoin ever.
Bitcoin (BTC) spiked 14% on the news to a new all-time-high above $44,000, and Tesla (TSLA) shares jumped 2%.
[READ MORE:How bitcoin narratives have evolved to fuel current price surge]
The $1.5 billion bitcoin buy puts Tesla in the company of two other consumer-facing tech companies that haveloaded up on bitcoinin the past year: Square (whichbought $50 million worth in October,amounting to 1% of its cash reserves) and cloud services provider MicroStrategy, which has kept buying more bitcoin in the last few months and now holds 71,079 bitcoin, worth more than $3 billion as of Monday morning.
Planning to accept bitcoin as payment puts Tesla in leaguewith PayPal, which began allowing its customers to buy and sell bitcoin, ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), and bitcoin cash (BCH) in its PayPal wallet in December, and will add the function to Venmo this year, along with the ability to make purchases with crypto.
On PayPal’s Q4 earnings call last week, CEO Dan Schulman said crypto trading volume has “exceeded expectations” and that the company’s crypto efforts so far are “just the beginning of an extensive roadmap” around crypto.
Tesla accepting bitcoin as payment in the future is “a potential game changing move for the use of bitcoin from a transactional perspective,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note on Monday, adding that the news “formalizes the strategy of Musk and Tesla diving into the deep end of the pool of bitcoin and crypto.”
Musk has tweeted about cryptocurrencies a number of times over the past year, but Tesla’s latest move takes his support from mere social media flag-waving to serious investment by the $820 billion publicly traded company he helms.
In May 2020, Muskreplied to a J.K. Rowling tweet about bitcoin, telling the “Harry Potter” author, “massive currency issuance by govt central banks is making Bitcoin Internet money look solid by comparison.” On the other hand, in December 2020 hetweeted that bitcoin“is almost as bs as fiat money.”
More recently, Musk has turned his Twitter feed, which has repeatedly had the power to move markets, to the meme-based cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE).
[READ MORE:What is dogecoin?]
In April 2019, Musk haddeclared, “Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool.” In the past few weeks, amid the Reddit-fueled market mania with stocks like GameStop and AMC,Musk has returned to pumping dogecoin, blasting out remarks like “Dogecoin is the people’s crypto” and Lion King memes featuring his face and the face of the Shiba Inu doge meme.
His tweets prompted a wave of social media buzz that made dogecointhe most tweeted-about cryptocurrency in a single dayon Jan. 28, beating a bitcoin single-day record from Jan. 2. Dogecoin surged so dramatically at one point that investment appRobinhood turned off its Instant Buying feature for just bitcoin and dogecoin.
In alive chat on the audio app Clubhouse on Jan. 31, Musk cautioned, “Occasionally I make jokes about dogecoin, but they are really meant to be jokes.”
But Tesla buying $1.5 billion of bitcoin is no joke. And among therecent spate of non-crypto tech companies showing serious buy-in for crypto, Tesla is the biggest name yet.

The censorship of keywords associated with Binance, Huobi, and OKEx by the popular internet services comes after government officials in mainland China recently started putting pressure on crypto mining and trading.
At press time, searching either the Chinese or English names of Binance, Huobi, and OKEx on Google-like Baidu, Sogo, Quora-like Zhihu, or Twitter-like Weibo shows zero search results, as verified by CoinDesk.

However, Weibo accounts for crypto Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) in China were still active at the time of writing, including Jay Hao, OKEx’s CEO and Justin Sun, the founder of Tron.

13886,2018-01-18 09:52:13,“Bitcoin Laundering” Study: Where Do Criminals Turn to Mask Illicit Cryptoassets?,"A recent study (PDF) from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance and blockchain analytics company Elliptic explored the “bitcoin laundering” ecosystem. In the study, Elliptic’s forensic analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain and other publicly available data were used to track the flows of illicit funds from 2013 to 2016.
“This study aimed to identify where individuals turn in order to cash out or transmit bitcoins (BTC) acquired from illicit entities and to discover typologies for criminals ‘laundering’ bitcoins,” the report says.
The study describes bitcoin laundering as a special type of money laundering that exists within the Bitcoin network where a user moves some bitcoins to a new address in a manner that obscures the original source of funds. The conversion of bitcoins into fiat currency on exchanges that lack adequate anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) policies can also fall under the category of bitcoin laundering.
In addition to describing the common mechanisms for bitcoin laundering and explaining that this sort of activity is a small percentage of all transactions sent to exchanges and other conversion services, the study also offers some recommendations for law enforcement in terms of preventing the masking of illicit funds on the Bitcoin network.
It should go without saying that any study related to the dark web or illicit use of the Bitcoin network needs to be taken with a grain of salt because avoiding detection is the whole reason for a criminal to use these sorts of platforms in the first place.
Much of the study, which is titled “Bitcoin Laundering: An Analysis of Illicit Flows Into Digital Currency Services,” revolves around the use of “conversion services.” Conversion services are basically platforms where users convert bitcoins to fiat currency (a Bitcoin exchange) or another cryptocurrency (a cryptoexchange), or move the bitcoins to another Bitcoin address accessible to the user. This results in a flow of funds that cannot be viewed or traced directly on the public blockchain.
According to the study, darknet markets are the main source of funds that are sent to conversion services in bitcoin laundering attempts.
Additionally, the number of illicit services that could be the source of “dirty bitcoins” sent to a conversion service increased fivefold from 2013 to 2016. Having said that, the study finds that the sources of illicit funds entering conversion services are quite centralized.
“Only a small number of entities account for the majority of illicit activity in our sample,” the study says. “Nine of the 102 illicit entities were the source of more than 95 percent of all laundered bitcoins in our study. All nine were darknet marketplaces.”
While exchanges are the most commonly used type of conversion service, bitcoin mixers and gambling sites have much more illicit funds coming into their platforms as a percentage of their overall transactions. As potential conduits for bitcoin laundering, these two types of conversion services benefit from concealing their country of operations and avoiding enforcement of AML regulations.
“Fewer than 10 percent of all transactions overall passed through unknown jurisdictions ... while 52 percent of illicit laundering went through them,” the study says.
Much like the sources of illicit funds, the conversion services where these funds are sent are also highly centralized, the study finds. The data indicates that 97 percent of illicit transaction volume at mixers and gambling sites goes through three different entities. Additionally, two platforms in Europe account for half of all illicit transfers that go into exchanges.
Another notable aspect of the study is that the data indicates a low level of bitcoin laundering as a percentage of all payments sent to conversion services.
“The amount of observed Bitcoin laundering was small (less than one percent of all transactions entering conversion services),” notes the study.
The report clarifies that the actual volume of illicit Bitcoin transactions sent to conversion services is “almost surely to be significantly larger” than what the data in the study shows because intermediate transactions are not counted. In other words, the report only covers transactions made directly from an illicit source, such as a darknet market, to a conversion service.
The study also indicates a decrease in illicit Bitcoin transaction volume going to conversion services over time.
“It is likely that illicit bitcoins fell as a percentage of total volume entering conversion services due to the cryptocurrency’s increasing popularity as a speculative investment as well as new laundering techniques,” the study says. “The drop may also reflect better AML/CFT compliance by conversion services, including the use of blockchain analysis services to determine customers’ source of funds.”
The study later adds, “Our study, the first of its kind, indicates that while most types of conversion services have received some bitcoins from illicit activity, the vast majority of the funds they receive do not appear to be illicit.”
The report offers recommendations for law enforcement in terms of what they can do to combat the effectiveness of bitcoin laundering.
First, the study says proper KYC and AML policies need to be enforced on the bitcoin mixers and gambling sites that allow for anonymous usage. It notes that the three conversion services that account for 97 percent of bitcoin laundering on these types of platforms should be targeted by financial authorities.
“The fact that most mixers and gambling sites hide their location of operations indicates they probably seek to evade the basic regulations in place to uphold transparency and financial integrity standards in most jurisdictions,” adds the study.
Of course, it should be noted that targeting these sorts of services will become nearly impossible as they become more decentralized over time. Decentralized platforms likeJoinMarket,TumbleBitandZeroLinkremove the ability for authorities to clamp down on bitcoin mixing in an effective manner, as these solutions act more as software than services.
Second, the report also calls for increased AML and KYC compliance at European exchanges.
“Many large European Bitcoin exchanges do implement robust AML policies,” says the study. “However, this is out of choice rather than obligation, and there are some who choose not to, possibly to attract business from criminals.”
The study adds that the European Union is already moving in the right direction via an update of their 2015 Anti-Money Laundering Directive to include fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchanges, but in the view of the authors of the paper, crypto-to-crypto exchanges must also be regulated in this manner.
Again, it needs to be pointed out that more problematic technology — at least from law enforcement’s point of view — is on the horizon in the form of decentralized cryptoexchanges. Through the use ofcross-chain atomic swaps via the lightning network, users will be able to instantly trade between different cryptoassets without the need for a trusted third party.
Third, the study calls for a sort of propaganda campaign against the use of darknet markets by criminals and the general public at large.
“Law enforcement should increase customer skepticism about [darknet market] sites’ integrity and reduce the perceived security of such platforms by exposing their vulnerabilities publicly,” says the study.
The report adds that law enforcement should make it well known that they’re lurking on these darknet markets to further shake confidence in them.
Darknet markets are another area of the Bitcoin ecosystem that are becoming more decentralized through platforms such as OpenBazaar. While illicit activity on theOpenBazaarnetwork appears to be limited at this time, it could potentially explode in popularity as a reaction to law enforcement’s hypothetical campaigns against the centralized darknet markets.
Fourth, the report praises the decision by financial authorities in the United States to regulate exchanges as Money Service Businesses. The authors of the paper would like to see this sort of policy rolled out worldwide.
Last, the study notes the need to prevent the illicit use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to get around economic sanctions imposed by the United States or other nations.
“In addition to mitigating illicit finance risks like criminal money laundering, there will likely be a need to develop strategies to counter state actors aiming to use cryptocurrencies to circumvent U.S., EU, and UN sanctions.”
Recently, there have beenreportsof North Korea, Russia and Venezuela all looking into separate mechanisms for avoiding economic sanctions through the use of cryptocurrencies.

It's been a big, rocky decade for crypto.
One way to gauge its popularity is to look at its prices — Bitcoin, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, began trading at$0.0008 in July 2010.Pricespeaked at over $64,000in November 2021. Today, it's just over $27,000.
It hasn't always been smooth sailing. Crypto is currently weatheringa cruel winterwith depressed prices,scandals, andlayoffs. Silvergate Capital — which used to be the go-to bank for the biggest names in crypto —saidon March 3 it plans to write off its assets and wind down its business, becoming one of the first mainstream victims of the crypto crash.
A few days later,Silicon Valley Bankand crypto-friendlySignature Bank, New Yorkcollapsed, rattling the banking sector and sparking fears of a contagion that could lead to the next global financial crisis.
And while the industrymade a few people very rich, it also came with problems — including addiction.
Enter: luxury crypto rehab centers.
Below, we've taken a look at the price tags and offerings at three luxury crypto centers around the globe, each of which claims to be the best in its field.
""With crypto addiction, it's all the time around the clock, and there is no market closing,"" Abdullah Boulad, the founder and CEO ofThe Balance, a luxury crypto rehab center, told Insider. ""That's why we say it's like a casino in your pocket,"" he added.
Boulad started the crypto program roughly six years ago in Switzerland and said he sees about a hundred clients a year. Most of these are entrepreneurs between the ages of 30 and 45 and are mostly men, he said.
Today, The Balance has10 properties across Spain, the UK, and Switzerland. It calls itselfthe ""world's best luxury rehab center and mental health clinic""and a ""safe haven where you can find recovery, peace, rest, and happiness."" People in the rehab program get access to a personal manager, a chef, and 70 specialists such as doctors, psychologists, and psychotherapists, per Boulad.
It doesn't come cheap: A typical four-week crypto rehab program at The Balance costs between 180,000 euros and 300,000 euros, or $192,000 and $320,000.
Each of The Balance's treatment villas has a pool, and is situated either in the countryside or on the beach, Boulad said. It also offers treatments for alcoholism, drug abuse, and detoxes, as well as a program aimedat celebrities in rehab.
In Asia, $25,000 for 28 days will get you an ""ultra made to measure"" treatment atThe Diamond, a luxury rehab center in Phuket, Thailand, its managing director, Theo de Vries, told Insider.
Here, 15 rooms sit atop a mountain overlooking the Andaman Sea. De Vries said clients have access to five clinical psychologists, four clinical addiction counselors, one psychiatrist, 24-7 nursing staff, four clinical support staff, and eight 5-star Thai hospitality staff members.
And then there's the property's luxury offerings: a spa, golfing, boat trips, and sporting activities.
""Whatever is possible without using drugs or alcohol,"" de Vries said, adding: ""Phuket is the perfect location for this kind of clientele.""
The Diamond started offering crypto rehab services at the beginning of 2021. About one in 40 inquiries de Vries gets is about crypto addiction, he said. These inquiries seem to remain constant, irrespective of market fluctuations, he said.
At about $100,000 a week, Paracelsus Recovery offers a four-week residential treatment program to treat crypto addiction.
Paracelsus started offering the treatment in 2020, CEO Jan Gerber told Insider.
Paracelsus — which owns four residences in Zurich, Switzerland — offers lakefront properties, complete with a ""private chef and maid, a private client suite within the residence, and a separate suite for a 24-hour live-in therapist,"" per Gerber.
Services at Paracelsus include the use of Bentley limousines and a dedicated driver for appointments or excursions, Gerber added. They can even arrange a piano for a client who would like to hone their skills and set up high-end sound systems, gaming consoles, VR, and even Netflix for the clients, he said.
Since 2020, the center has treated two or three clients annually for crypto addiction.
Mark Griffiths,a professor of behavioral addiction at Nottingham Trent University, told Insider that he sees crypto trading as a sub-variety of gambling, and therefore sees an addiction to crypto as an addiction to gambling. He says those who are addicted to crypto display six criteria:
• Salience — crypto trading is the most important thing in their life and they are totally preoccupied with it;
• Conflict — crypto trading conflicts with other important things in life such as relationships, occupation and/or education;
• Withdrawal — they experience withdrawal symptoms if they are unable to engage in crypto trading;
• Mood modification  — they use crypto trading as a way to change their mood state;
• Tolerance — over time, they have increased the amount of trading they do daily; and
• Relapse — if a person gives up trading for some time, when they do it again, they go straight back into the addictive cycles they were in previously.
""If anyone fulfills all these six criteria, I would class them as being addicted,"" Griffiths said. ""If they only endorse some of them, I would view them as having a problem with crypto trading rather than being addicted.""
""The number of people likely to be genuinely addicted to this is likely to be very small,"" he added.
Anna Lembke, a psychiatry professor at Stanford University and the head of the Stanford Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic,told the BBC in Februarythat the treatment for crypto addiction is similar to other addictions.
""It's a biopsychosocial disease so it requires a biopsychosocial intervention: medications in some cases, individual and group psychotherapy, changing habits and environment, implementing healthier replacement activities,"" she told the news outlet.
De Vries said the treatment works: ""People got clean. They changed their whole lifestyle. They got families again, and they're happy because we solved the underlying issues,"" he said, adding.
The Balance's Boulad said people can get out of crypto addiction by working on behavioral patterns and living a balanced life, but relapses do occur. He estimated the relapse rate is around 20-30% for this type of treatment.
Gerber of Paracelsus said relapse risks are higher for professional traders or those who previously made a living from trading.
""To find a way to 'healthy' trading, with constant exposure to the dynamics of the trade, is very difficult. Complete abstinence is always the safest bet with an addiction, but not the only way,"" he added.

1928,2017-07-21 17:57:42,The pizza-making robots that want to change the world,"HBO’s comedy “Silicon Valley” makes fun of the way even boring startup tech companies adopt the same mission statement: “To make the world a better place.”
But serial entrepreneur and former Microsoft executiveAlex Gardenisn’t shy about stating his new company’s path to making the world a better place—throughpizza. It’s not just any pizza, though. Zume pizzas are made by robots, and they’re cooked in pizza ovensinsidedelivery trucks.
“One of the founding principles of this company is that every American has a right to a healthy meal they can afford,” he told me. “If you look at pizza, what is it? It’s high-quality bread, and high-quality organic vegetables, and meats and cheeses. All of these things are things that are good for you in moderation. And the number of calories really is a function of how much sugar is in the food. Zume Pizza is half the calories per slice, roughly half the cholesterol and half the fat, of any of the national leading chains.”
How? “The main reason is sugar,” says Garden, whose pizzas range in price from$10 for a cheese to $20 for a pineapple express.
“We don’t put any extra sugar in the sauce. We don’t put any extra sugar in the dough. And we let our dough age for 24 hours; during that process, the fermentation of the dough further reduces the sugar in it.”
He also has much to say about where he gets his ingredients—directly from the providers, without the warehouses and distribution channels that, say, Pizza Hut (YUM) or Domino’s (DPZ) employ. He uses software—predictive algorithms—to know what he’ll need when. He makes his sausage and tomato sauce in-house.
But that’s not the most headline-grabbing feature of Zume pizza,which was founded in 2015 and currently delivers in Mountain View, California, and surrounding areas. The biggest feature is the robots.
Inside the Zume kitchen, robots are displacing more human workers every passing month. These days, one robot presses out the dough into the familiar flattened circle; a second and third (Pepe and Giorgio) squirt tomato sauce or white sauce onto each pie; a fourth (Marta) spreads the sauce around (“perfectly, but not too perfectly,” Garden says). Humans apply the toppings, but then a fourth machine (Bruno) scoops up the pizza from the conveyor belt and delicately lays it into the baking oven; a fifth (Leonardo) chops it neatly into eight slices with a single, 200-pounds-of-force stroke.
Eventually, Garden and his cofounder Julia Collins intend to replace all of the humans in their pizza shop.
The robots are fun to watch—as long as you can avoid thinking, “This is what the end of human employment looks like.”
But Garden insists that replacing the people is also part of making the world a better place.
“The automation exists so that we can eliminate boring, repetitive jobs, and provide a more rewarding work environment for our employees,” he says. “And it exists so that we can buy higher quality ingredients. That’s the reason why we use it.”
For example, he says, “taking a pizza off of a production line and putting it into an 800-degree oven is actually not particularly rewarding, and it’s also quite dangerous. So we found a way to automate that work now that was previously done by a person.
“So what happens to the person? Well, good news. We’re a high-growth company. We have people who’ve moved from a role in the kitchen to other roles—to customer support or to finance. You come in and prove that you can work the Zume way, and we make a lifetime commitment to you in return.”
The math still didn’t work for me. “But today, 100 people work here,” I said. “If you didn’t have the robots, it would be 115.”
“That is true,” he replied, “but here’s the point you have to consider. If you took a national competitor that we compete against, what percentage of their workforce are making the absolute rock-bottom minimum wage for the place they work? $7 an hour, $7.50 an hour? Do they have benefits? Is it a safe job? What hours are they working?
“Every employee in this company makes a minimum of $15 an hour. Everyone gets full medical, dental, vision [insurance] for them and for their families. And everyone, when they hit their six-month mark, becomes a shareholder. So you can make an argument that the absolute number of employed people is the way to go; we don’t believe that.”
Garden and his team have obsessed over every aspect of the American pizza-delivery system—including the box. Zume’s pizza is excellent, but the box is a masterpiece. (“So you redesigned the box?” I asked him. His reply: “We didn’t redesign the box. We designed the box.”)
It’s made of compressed sugar cane (!), so it’s compostable, biodegradable, and collapsible—you can fold it up to fit your compost or trash can. Garden says that it also keeps the pizza warmer, keeps it dry, and prevents it from getting soggy, thanks to eight narrow channels below the pizza, like spokes. They conduct moisture down and away from the crust, pooling in a shallow well under the middle. “Your hands will be completely clean after you eat a Zume pizza, because there’s no grease or sogginess anywhere.”
(This I found hard to believe. But as my family discovered when we ate Zume pizza that night, it’s absolutely true: Our fingers were not greasy.)
The box’s lid slips under the lower box, which (a) creates a nice little stand and (b) doesn’t occupy your entire table with the ugly, greasy open lid, as a regular box does.
It even has shallow round depressions that match depressions in the top of the lid, so that stacked boxes sort of interlock. “With one hand, you can carry five pizzas and walk around, and there’s no hope of them falling over,” Garden points out.
But Alex Garden isn’t finished yet. He’s also reinvented the delivery truck.
Each one contains 28 or 56 individual pizza ovens. By consulting GPS, the truck fires up the oven when it’s four minutes away from your house, so that the pizza is coming out of the oven as the truck arrives.
That cook-en-route system might sound like it was designed to give you freshly baked pizza, but it was actually Garden’s solution to a knotty governmental problem: It’s against the law for workers to cook food in a truck while it’s moving.
The solution, of course, was to automate the cooking while in motion. No person is involved, and so no laws are broken.
Laws also dictate, by the way, that a food truck must contain a three-compartment sink—for washing utensils, spatulas, and so on. Garden didn’t want to devote precious oven space to some sink apparatus. So he came up with a utensil-free truck. As the pizza finishes cooking, it ejects from its oven like a CD from its player, and goes directly into the Zume pizza box. “No one ever touches the food,” he says, and so there’s no need for a sink in the truck.
The part of Zume’s master plan that I found hardest to believe was that often, your pizza is on its truck before you even order it. Garden says that Zume’s AI software predicts what pizzas its customers will order, when, and pre-loads them onto the truck. How could he possibly know what his customers will order?
“Do you order pizza?” he asked me.
Yes, I told him.
“And how often would you say when you order pizza, you get the same thing you got last time?”
“Probably 95% of the time,” I admitted.
“Usually on the same day that week? Yeah. That makes you like most of the other people in the country. So if you think about that…Plus things like, when there’s a game you get more orders; when it’s hot out, you get fewer orders; you sell a lot more cheese pizza around 6:00 p.m. than you do at 9:00 p.m.; [you get spikes during] political debates; and another three or four dozen factors that we take into consideration when we’re predicting volume.
“Then we look at it neighborhood by neighborhood. Perhaps there’s a neighborhood that really likes Hawaiian pizza, there’s another neighborhood who really likes pepperoni pizza. So we have all of these signals and they give us the ability to predict about 95% of the time what people are going to order, before they do.”
And what if there’s a run on pineapple pizza on a weird day?
“We have what we called field reloading, which is giving the trucks more inventory in flight. It’s almost like air-to-air refueling in the Air Force.”
Zume has been steadily expanding the towns its trucks can reach: Now, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Atherton, and East Palo Alto. Next year, all of California; then to the whole country; then the world.
That’s the plan, anyway.
Will Zume’s robots and lofty goals really make the world a better place?
Well, already they’re making the world a better pizza—and that’s a good start.

31885,2022-02-15 11:32:28,Bitcoin Investors De-Risking Ahead of March Interest Rate Hikes,"The last week, saw the top crypto asset in a relatively volatile space as reports about Russia’s plans toinvade Ukraine emerged.
That said, numerous macro factors have given way to skepticism and volatility in theBitcoinmarket including the tightening of Fed policy expected in March.
The Bitcoin derivativesmarketwas shadowed by uncertainty with a flattening out of the futures term structure curve until March.
That said, a Glassnodereportpointed out that BTC futures premiums out to the end of 2022 are considerably low, trading at a mere 6% annualized, eliminating the possibility of a wild short-term price uptick.
Notably, the futures term structure has flattened out through to March, in tandem with the expected rate hikes proposed by the Federal Reserve.
With the top coin’s current trajectory looking rangebound, participants seem to be expressing a strong preference for protective put options to effectively manage market risk.
In contrast, on-chain supply dynamics for Bitcoin still looked solid which was indicative of investors holding on to the top coin.
Bitcoin still continued to flow out of reserves and into investor wallets at a rate of 42.9K BTC per month. This trend of net outflows has been sustained for around 3-weeks, supporting the current price bounce from the recent $33.5K lows.
Overall, this speaks to the continuing maturation of the Bitcoin market, as liquidity deepens, and more comprehensive risk management instruments become available. This differs greatly in comparison to historical Bitcoin market cycles where de-risking was possible only by the sale of coins in spot markets.
While BTC’s turbulent price action has given way to many spot-driven sell-offs, long-term HODLers have been resilient. Since the October ATH, LTHs have spent only 175K BTC on net, demonstrating exceptional resilience, despite the prevailing macro headwinds.
At press time, BTC’s price was headed towards the $45K resistance mark once again, trading at $44,200.20 noting a 4.68% rise in price over the last day. However, since BTC has faced considerable resistance at that mark another rebound from that price range could be expected.
Overall, though, looking at the derivative and futures market the trend speaks to the continuing maturation of the Bitcoin market, as liquidity deepens, and more comprehensive risk management instruments become available.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact, in spite of the latest pullback to sub-$54,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need a sustained fall through the 62% FIB of $28,814 to form a near-term bearish trend.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break out from this morning’s high $57,977.
Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely cap the upside.
In the event of an extended rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at $60,000 levels before easing back. The second major resistance level sits at $60,105.
A fall through the $56,094 pivot would bring the first major support level at $54,720 into play.
Barring another extended sell-off on the day, Bitcoin should steer clear of the second major support level at $52,083. The 23.6% FIB of $53,628 should limit the downside.

70218,2023-04-01 13:01:02,What Does Satoshi Nakamoto Look Like? AI Provides Some Answers,"The greatest unanswered question in crypto (aside from when will the U.S. create intelligible rules and regulations) is:Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? Whilesome have claimedto be the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin andothers have had their lives turned upside downby media speculation, the mystery continues.
So I figured that now that AI appears to know and see all, maybe it could give us a glimpse into what Satoshi may look like.
I started with ChatGPT4, which doesn’t generate images but is the AI text engine that is eating the world these days. I asked it what prompt I should use for its sister AI, Dall-E. It recommended: “Generate a series of artistic renderings that imagine the possible appearance of Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin. Feel free to explore various styles, ethnicities, and time periods while incorporating visual elements related to cryptocurrency and technology in the illustrations.”
Cool, cool. I fed that into Midjourney, curious to see what would come out.
The first one that popped out was a Jedi Knight, an Obi-Wan Kenobi-type character. Clearly, Midjourney has been watching too much Star Wars:
The next one looked equally mythic:
But then it went on a different tangent and coughed up a cross between Sherlock Holmes and Dumbledore:
For some reason, all of these Nakamotos have beards, which is weird. Or maybe that’s how Midjourney interpreted “mysterious?” Whatever.
Next, I fed that prompt into DALL-E and got this, which is definitely worthy of a T-shirt:
Then for giggles, I used the same prompt but asked for a photo:
WTF? Battahoch? Battahoch. Even ChatGPT4 was baffled: “I’m sorry, but I couldn’t find any information on the term 'Battahoch.' It could be a typo or a word from a fictional work, a specific subculture, or a term that has not gained widespread recognition.”
But let’s not stop there. A thriving movement in Web3 says, “Satoshi is Female,” I asked Midjourney and Dall-E to imagine what this mysterious woman might look like.
Definitely mysterious in a kind of Botticelli/Venus-y way. And there were two almost anime-like treatments:
Some theories suggest that Nakamoto is a collective of people interested in digital money back in the days of the cypherpunks mailing list when Nakamoto first contacted Hal Finney about his new creation. Proponents of the “Satoshi is a group of people” theory include Finney, Blockstream CEO Adam Back, OG cryptographer Nick Szabo, and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin in that group. Suitably prompted, here’s what the Satoshi Conglomerate looks like:
Wow, Lubin really looks like Walter White.
Finally, I tried running the usual suspects through Playground, and what it produced was, well, the stuff of bad dreams:

14269,2019-07-17 19:15:33,Bridgewater Tycoon’s Gold Shilling Is Insanely Bullish for Bitcoin,"When billionaire investor and hedge fund manager Ray Dalio speaks, people listen. After all, Dalio is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund firm with assets under management of $160 billion. So when Dalio said thatgoldwill become a top investmentduringa “paradigm shift” in global markets, the price of the yellow metal spiked. But he probably missed the fact that gold will have competition frombitcoin.
Dalio wrote in aLinkedIn postthat too many people have invested in stocks and equities, which is why this asset class runs the risk of witnessing a drop in returns. In order to balance out their portfolio, investors will turn to assets such as gold. He wrote:
“Additionally, for reasons I will explain in the near future, most investors are underweighted in such assets, meaning that if they just wanted to have a better balanced portfolio to reduce risk, they would have more of this sort of asset. For this reason, I believe that it would be both risk-reducing and return-enhancing to consider adding gold to one’s portfolio.”
So Dalio advocates that gold is the right way to go for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio at a time when most of the world seems to be invested in equities. But this is not the only reason why Dalio believes gold will witness a surge in inflows.
According to the hedge fund veteran, global conflicts and the depreciating value of money will force a flight to safety. Gold will be the asset of choice for investors looking to store their wealth at a time when central banks are busy keeping interest rates low.
Dalio’s comments would have made a lot of sense a decade ago when bitcoin was just born. After all, gold is universally considered to be a safe-haven asset that investors buy to protect their wealth in difficult times. But bitcoin is gaining the confidence ofinstitutional investors, and there are quite a few who believe that the cryptocurrency can replace gold as a safe-haven asset.

10572,2017-12-26 14:54:00,3 Upcoming Tax Changes Homeowners Need to Know About,"Like it or not,tax reformwill soon officially be upon us. And while countless Americans will be impacted by the new laws, both for better and for worse, homeowners in particular will see a number of key changes take effect in the very near future. If you own property, here's what you can expect.
Homeowners in states with high taxes like New York, New Jersey, and California have, up until now, gotten a bit of a break in the form of the SALT (state and local tax) deduction. Under the current law, you're allowed to write off the total amount you pay in state income and local property taxes, but under the new law, that deduction will be limited to $10,000 total. Given that more than 4 million Americans pay over $10,000 a year in property taxes alone, that's a pretty harsh blow for those whose deductions will be slashed going forward.
IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.
There is, however, one thing you can do to ever so slightly ease the pain. If your town allows, you can look into prepaying your 2018 property taxes, or a portion thereof, before 2017 comes to a close. This will allow you to eke out some additional tax savings before the $10,000 SALT cap takes effect. Keep in mind, however, that you can't apply the same strategy to your state income taxes -- the new bill prohibits prepayments there.
The mortgage interest deduction has long been a huge money-saver for homeowners, and it still will be, but to a lesser extent. While homeowners could, up until now, deduct interest on a home loan of up to $1 million, that cap will be lowered to $750,000 come 2018. Now if you have an existing mortgage, you don't need to worry about this change, but if you're applying for a new home loan in 2018, you should know about the impending cap.
One thing to note about this reduction, however, is that it's not all that bad in the grand scheme of what could've been. Legislators have long been campaigning to eliminate or slash the mortgage interest deduction since it's been said to grossly favor the rich. And to some extent, that's true.
Remember, the value of atax deductionlies in your effective tax rate. The higher your rate, the more valuable a deduction becomes. So in this regard, one can argue that the wealthy derive greater benefits fromalldeductions, not just the mortgage interest deduction. However, since those with more money are also the most likely to swing higher mortgages, it's been said that this particular deduction is notably skewed. However, in some areas of the country, middle earners have no choice but to stretch their budgets to buy properties at inflated prices -- so it's not just the rich who could lose out with this cap.
Home equity loanshave long served as a key source of financing for homeowners, and up until now, homeowners could deduct interest on loans worth up to $100,000. Under the new tax changes, however, this provision is going away and home equity loan interest will no longer be deductible at all. Furthermore, whereas homeowners with existing mortgages are grandfathered into the old laws, home equity loan holders don't get that same leeway. This means that if you have a home equity loan and were counting on writing off its interest next year, you'd better think again.
While some homeowners won't be impacted by the upcoming tax changes, countless Americans do stand to lose out on some key tax-saving opportunities. If you're one of them, then it pays to be strategic about your 2018 taxes and look into other ways to save going forward. This could mean being smart about selling investments or capitalizing on other deductions that won't get altered under the new rules. For better or worse, the tax system is going to change before our eyes, and the best thing you can do as a homeowner is learn to roll with the punches.

By Amanda Cooper
LONDON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Global equities rose on Wednesday after U.S. employment data reinforced investors' convictions that rates may soon start to fall, which has pushed down bond yields and lifted gold in the past few trading days.
The flow of trade across the markets was relatively calm, with measures of volatility steady around their recent lows, as investors waiting for a read of U.S. private sector job growth later in the day.
A separate look at job openings on Tuesday showed a bit more softness than expected but not so much as to point to a steeper slowdown in employment, while activity in the U.S. services sector held up last month.
U.S. Treasury yields held roughly around their lowest in three months, while futures markets show traders are placing a two-in-three chance of a rate cut by March, which in turn gave gold another boost and underpinned stocks.
The MSCI All-World was up 0.2%, while in Europe, the STOXX 600 rose 0.2%. German's DAX, which contains a number of tech and industrial heavyweights, hit record highs.
Next up on the data front is the ADP survey of U.S. private sector employment, which is forecast to show a rise of 130,000 in November, according to a Reuters poll.
""We are starting see increasing evidence that the U.S. jobs market is starting to slow, with vacancies falling to their lowest level since March 2021 and with the last two ADP reports adding a combined 202k new jobs as private sector hiring slows,"" CMC Markets chief market strategist Michael Hewson said.
""October saw 113,000 jobs added - an improvement on September - and November is expected to see an improvement on that to 130,000, given that a lot of additional hiring takes place in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving and the Christmas period so we’re unlikely to see any evidence of cracking in the U.S. labour market this side of 2024,"" he said.
RATE-CUT BOUNCE
U.S. stock futures pointed higher, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq indicated up 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures rose 0.22%. U.S. 10-year yields were up 2 basis points at 4.195%, having hit their lowest since early September the day before.
The ""selloff in yields across the curve is strong evidence of the intense focus the market has on this week's labour market data,"" with the ADP employment report due on Wednesday and non-farm payrolls on Friday, said IG analyst Tony Sycamore.
With markets all but certain the Fed's next move is a cut, dovish rhetoric from European Central Bank officials and the Reserve Bank of Australia's decision to hold policy steady on Tuesday have stoked bets for a peak in rates globally. The Bank of Canada is widely expected to adopt a wait-and-see attitude on Wednesday as well.
That has supported the U.S. currency's rebound from last week's nearly four-month low, with the U.S. dollar index steady around 104.00 on Wednesday, compared with a trough of 102.46 a week ago.
""The USD weakened when the Federal Reserve looked like they were cutting while other central banks were holding tight,"" said James Kniveton, a senior corporate FX dealer at Convera in Melbourne. ""Now that looks to be changing, and other central banks are following the Fed's lead.""
Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.16% to 147.37 and held steady against the euro at $1.0788.
Bitcoin edged up 0.3% to $44,170, having risen to as much as $44,490 overnight, buoyed by both Fed rate cut expectations and speculation U.S regulators will soon approve exchange-traded spot bitcoin funds.
Gold rose 0.1% to $2,022 an ounce, stabilising after Monday's surge to a record $2,135.40.
Crude fell another 1% on Wednesday to five-month lows, against a backdrop of a worsening demand outlook from China and doubts about the impact of OPEC cuts.
Brent crude futures fell 1.1% to $76.37 a barrel, while U.S. futures fell by the same amount to $71.53.

• The anti-risk yen slides while BTC and stock futures rise after Uchida's comments.
• The renewed risk-on hints at a possible bitcoin death cross bear trap.
It appears bitcoin's {{BTC}} impending death cross, a bearish technical pattern, will again live up to its reputation as a contrary indicator, presaging renewed bullish price actionas it did in September 2023.
That's because early on Wednesday, the influential deputy governor of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), Shinichi Uchida,saidthat the central bank wouldn't hike borrowing costs when markets are unstable, weakening the case for a continued unwinding of ""yen carry trades"" and resulting risk aversion in risk assets, including bitcoin.
""As we're seeing sharp volatility in domestic and overseas financial markets, it's necessary to maintain current levels of monetary easing for the time being,"" Uchida said in a speech to business leaders in Hakodate, Hokkaido.
Other things being equal, BOJ's latest comments mean limited downside in the cryptocurrency even as thedeath cross, characterized by the cryptocurrency's 50-day simple moving average (SMA) moving below the pivotal 200-day SMA, looms.
Bitcointraded firmfollowing Uchida's comments, briefly topping the $57,300 mark as the Japanese yen (JPY) depreciated to 148 per U.S. dollar (USD) from 145 per USD. Japan's equity index, Nikkei, rose 4%, signaling a risk reset, and futures tied to the S&P 500 rose 0.8%.
""The BOJ struck the 'Yen put,' and the Nikkei will be driving the Nasdaq and S&P to their pre-selloff levels,"" pseudonymous market observer Global Macrosaid on X.
The yen carry trade involves taking out cheap yen-denominated loans and investing in high-yielding currencies like the Mexican peso and risk assets. The strategy has been quite popular in recent years as the Bank of Japan kept interest rates at zero while others, including the Fed, raised borrowing costs rapidly to combat inflation.
However, last Wednesday, the Japanese central bankraised rates, ditching the ultra-easy monetary policy for the first time in 17 years. The hawkish move triggered anunwinding of carry trades, causing broad-based risk aversion. BTC tanked from $66,000 to $50,000 in five days to Monday.
""By July 16th, the equity markets and many other risky asset markets peaked. For whatever reason, these asset markets began to sell off. As the sell-off continued, recent entrants into the YCT [yen carry trade] saw their assets falling, and to be clear, that is almost always the driver of unwinds. But worse, the Yen began rallying slowly. That began the unwind,"" Andy Constan, CEO of Damped Spring Advisors, said in a detailed yen carry trade explainer on X.
""The unwind of the trade results in inelastic price moving flow to buy Yen and sell risky assets. The sale of the risky asset also impacts the much bigger set of levered investors who don't have any yen exposure at all and they get margin called as well,"" Constan added.

63093,2022-05-11 17:56:36,Bitcoin Miner Argo Blockchain 'Leans Toward' Designing Custom Miners With Intel Chips,"Don't miss CoinDesk'sConsensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12.
Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm Argo Blockchain (ARBK) is “leaning toward” designing its own machines using Intel’s chips, and working with a third-party manufacturer to bring them to life, the firm’s CEO Peter Wall told CoinDesk in an interview.
The Intel chips are expected to break the duopoly of Bitmain and MicroBT, which are dominating the mining application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) market.
More than that, Wall’s interview with CoinDesk shows how they can give miners the opportunity to design their own machines, instead of having to settle for ready-made ones from manufacturers.

Argo is one of a handful of companies that will be buying Intel’s new bitcoin mining ASICs, theother three beingJack Dorsey’s Block (SQ), Hive Blockchain (HIVE) andGriid Infrastructure.
The firm had already said it would be deploying “custom-designed mining machines utilizing Intel's state-of-the-art ASIC Blockscale chips” in itsannual earnings report for 2021, but hadn’t specified exactly how they would be designed and produced.
There are two options as to how bitcoin miners can operationalize Intel’s chips, Wall said. The first is to “get the chips” and then “work with your own third-party manufacturer to design and build a machine to your liking,” he said. The second is to work with manufacturers recommended by Intel to build the bitcoin mining rigs, he said.
Given Argo’s history, which shows that their “preference is always to have more control and more customization,” the company is leaning towards the first option, which is to “be able to build our own custom rigs,” Wall said.
Asked about specific aspects of customization, the CEO mentioned “form factors” and customizing bitcoin mining rigs for immersion versus air cooling. Immersion cooling is a technology in which machines are immersed in liquid that doesn’t conduct electricity, in order to be cooled down, as opposed to using tools like fans.
By customizing the mining machines, Argo can also control “a lot more of the software side of things” which is “a huge advantage ... particularly in the immersion environment,” Wall said.
The Argo CEO said that more details will come out in the next few weeks.
There are three “Ms” that matter in bitcoin mining: money, megawatts and machines, Wall said. Miners have been innovating with the first two, coming up with innovative financing solutions andworking more closely with energy producers, so it only makes sense if eventually they start addressing the machines part of the equation, he said.
Over time “other miners are going to realize that this is the direction to go,” meaning customized machines, according to the CEO.
A key roadblock for customizing bitcoin mining rigs so far has been the chip manufacturers. Existing industry players like Bitmain and MicroBT tend to keep their designs and even supply chain under wraps. “You need a chip manufacturer that is willing to play ball, and that's what's cool with Intel is that they're really just interested in selling chips,” Wall said.
However, to pull off making customized bitcoin miners, firms need a lot of technical expertise, as well as experience in mining, chips and firmware, he said.
At the end of the day, “the proof is in the pudding,” Wall said. Just like Argo’s Helios mine, which finallystarted operating this weekafter more thannine months of construction, only when the results of their machine customization efforts are tangible will the firm be able to say, “it was hard, but we did it.”",29772.46,0.01,29864.69,0.32,30129.91,1.22,29821.82,0.18,29768.06
11218,2018-01-02 05:54:04,Dollar on defensive at start of 2018; Asian currencies shine,"By Masayuki Kitano SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar languished near a three-month low versus a basket of major currencies on Tuesday as markets reopened at the start of 2018, while Asian currencies such as the Chinese yuan began the year on a high note. The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 92.162. On Friday it had slipped to as low as 92.080, the weakest level since Sept. 22. For the whole of 2017, the dollar index slid more than 9.8 percent, the greenback's worst annual performance since 2003. The dollar retreated in 2017, partly because economic growth picked up outside the United States, with other countries' central banks moving towards tighter monetary policy, lessening the perceived divergence between the Federal Reserve and others. The euro edged up 0.1 percent on the day at $1.2018, after having surged 14 percent in 2017 for its best annual performance since 2003. The euro had risen 1.1 percent in the last week of 2017, bringing it back within sight of a 2-1/2 year peak of $1.2092 set in September. In addition to political factors such as the Italian election in March, a key factor for the euro in 2018 is how the European Central Bank proceeds with curtailing its massive monetary stimulus. With the dollar on the defensive, emerging Asian currencies clawed higher. The Chinese yuan rose to as high as 6.4922 yuan per dollar, its highest level since Sept. 8. ""Highlighting today's moves is the euro trading above $1.20 and the Chinese yuan dropping below 6.5,"" said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore. ""There's across-the-board strength in Asian currencies on the back of such moves,"" Okagawa said, adding that a drop in the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield toward the end of 2017 was helping to weigh on the U.S. dollar. The greenback's weak tone helped boost the Singapore dollar, which rose to S$1.3322 per U.S. dollar at one point, its strongest level since June 2016. Story continues In addition, data released on Tuesday showed Singapore's economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter as factories lost steam, but a services sector recovery helped underscore expectations that the city-state's central bank could tighten its exchange-rate based monetary policy as early as April. Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known digital currency, fell 2.0 percent to around $13,175 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange. Bitcoin had soared in 2017, gaining more than 1,300 percent for the year.

44592,2019-10-19 19:09:13,"Wave and Vertalo start by tokenizing yield, with race horses and whiskey as long term possibilities","Asset management firm Wave Financial launched its first bitcoin yield fund last month with the help of Vertalo, the tokenization solution company that helped PrimeTrust put cap tables on blockchain earlier this year. Wave touts the fund as the first crypto derivatives-based yield fund on the market, but the partnership is planning to expand to legacy markets.
The fund itself generates yield by selling call options on bitcoin held in the fund, generating premiums from the high volatility. The income pays out monthly by distributing a dividend of 1.5% of the native asset value each month. Wave said it expects an 18% annual target yield. Fidelity Digital Assets custodies the fund’s BTC.
On the tokenization front, Wave is issuing Fund Tokens related tot he yield fund that aren’t registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, meaning U.S. investors will have to stay on the bench. In order to execute a tokenized fund, Wave said Vertalo had all the right connections. Dave Hendricks, CEO of Vertalo, said they’re the only player in the industry that could get this tokenization effort off the ground.
“There was no other provider on the market that could work with all of the other providers needed to make this fund happen,” he said. “We were already partners with the other participants they were working with, and we were the missing piece.”
Benjamin Tsai, managing partner and president at Wave, said that while there are a number of players in the space, Vertalo gives the fund flexibility to be more integrated with shared partners.
Hendricks explained that Vertalo’s role is essentially a stakeholder in data management or on-chain investor relations for the fund. In 2018, Vertalo began lining up partnerships.
One such player in Wave’s fund is PrimeTrust, which Vertalo worked with to put cap tables on a blockchain. Hendricks previously called this the first step to the coming tokenization revolution. Now, he said a lot of problems are being quietly solved.
“They’re not all announced because it takes a while, like the stuff we’re doing with Wave and the stuff we’re doing with PrimeTrust, it takes a while to bring these things to market,” he said.
Contrasted from an initial coin offering or tokenizing shares, tokenization of a fund or other ventures has more risk, according to Hendricks.
In fact, a tokenized bitcoin fund is just the start of the Wave/Vertalo partnership, according to both Hendricks and Tsai. Other ventures in the works are focusing on tokenizing indices and fractionalizing a variety of physical assets, like fine art, in addition to the tokenization of yield ventures, like the recent bitcoin derivatives fund.
Fractionalizing things people want to buy is at the heart of these ventures, according to Hendricks – not creating value through tokens but rather fractionalizing existing value.
“We bring the blockchain and tokenization revolution to come to the old stodgy legacy markets,” he said.
One of these legacy markets that some tokenization ventures have pursued is real estate has been the common entry point for tokenization, but Wave and Vertalo are widening their gaze to a variety of places, like whiskey barrel futures, clean water and racehorses.
“The boring way of saying it is we’re providing balance sheets to distillers and to participate in the upside of aging of whiskey,” said Tsai. “The exciting stuff to say is you can fractionally own an inventory of whiskey and as an agent it’s a great investment product because it has an attractive increase in value with a great investment curve or increase in value curve.”
While neither option is currently offered, teams are in place looking into possibilities in these areas and others, according to Vertalo and Wave.Vertalo and Wave teased tokenization ventures to come going forward that will reach beyond yield products.

• Theletterproposes new legislation that would prevent U.S. citizens from purchasing digital assets using their funds in IRAs and other pension plans such as 401(k).
• It also seeks the rejection of two recently proposed acts – the Retirement Savings Modernization Act and the Financial Freedom Act of 2022 – that sought to allow digital asset investments for retirement funds.
• James cited four main reasons for prohibiting crypto purchases: the protection of retirement savings from digital assets, Congress’ obligation to “protect the retirement savings of America’s workers from digital assets,” the materialization of the risks posed by digital assets, and prohibiting digital assets because of a lack of intrinsic value and risk of fraud.
• The letter comes even as half of all investors in the U.S. wished to see crypto as part of their 401(k) retirement plans, according to an Octobersurveyby asset manager Charles Schwab.

79895,2022-12-19 18:26:50,Why Is Mullen (MULN) Stock Down 10% Today?,"It’s been an ugly stretch for electric vehicle (EV) stocks. While that includes the juggernauts like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), it also includes the smaller companies like Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN ). Case in point? MULN stock is down about 10% on Monday. At today’s low, shares changed hands at 26 cents a share. While that’s still more than 40% above the 52-week low, the trend has not been kind. However, it has been interesting. Short interest was being flagged as a potential catalyst for MULN stock last week. Shortly after, the stock more than doubled in a three-day stretch. After the high on Thursday, shares are already down more than 30%. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips So when investors ask, “Why is Mullen stock down 10% today?” the answer can be pretty easy: Volatility. When we look at a stock like Tesla, it is not performing well. Shares have now made new 52-week lows in five straight sessions. That’s indicative of a bearish trend as bulls continue to bail. At the same time though, almost all EV stocks are under pressure. The Chinese EV stocks were doing better lately on the promise of a reopening economy in China, but the sellers have caught up with them as well. MULN Stock Tries to Avoid New Lows In other words, there’s been no escaping the selling pressure in these stocks. Yet at the same time, Nio (NYSE: NIO ), Tesla and others have solid growth, with streamlined production and deliveries. These automakers are true businesses and while they can still falter, they have long-term promise. That’s not to say Mullen Automotive is set to fail and MULN stock is destined to trade over the counter, but it’s a much bigger risk than a Tesla or Nio at this point. The recent volatility in the stock price does little to calm investors’ nerves. Shares shouldn’t double in a three-day stretch, while a short-squeeze is far from the most bullish catalyst investors can rely on — at least on a fundamental basis. Story continues There’s not much analyst coverage on MULN stock. However, while they do expect revenue to double this year to about $131 million, the analyst expects just 11% growth in sales next year. While Mullen did receive a nice-sized order last week — good for 6,000 cargo vans from R andy Marion Isuzu, LLC — there are still concerns about the company from a profit and loss perspective. For now, fundamental investors may want to look elsewhere in the EV space. The exception is if they are looking for a purely speculative space.

• Tim Draper has made a case for everyone to hold Bitcoin.
• The billionaire investor has unveiled plans to build around the asset.
• Draper is extremely bullish on Bitcoin’s price.
There is a growing Bitcoin rush.
Perhaps characteristic of the speed of the digital age, Bitcoin has risen from a fringe libertarian fad to an asset that threatens to swallow up Wall Street in just 16 years.
Against this backdrop, proponents continue to warn those on the sidelines against missing the train. Among these proponents is billionaire investor Tim Draper.

Speaking at the Financial Times Digital Assets Summit on Wednesday, Draper was quoted as saying byDecryptthat companies that have yet to add Bitcoin to their corporate treasuries are “being irresponsible.”
The statement comes as several firms are now adopting the Bitcoin treasury model popularized byStrategy. These includeSemler Scientific (NASDAQ:SMLR),MetaplanetandGameStop (NYSE:GME). Some emerging ventures are also trying to build a business on Bitcoin acquisitions. The most prominent example isTwenty One, a joint venture involving stablecoin giant Tether and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, intending to launch with about $4 billion worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet.
""Everybody ought to have some Bitcoin,” Draper said, according to Decrypt. He noted that even governments were beginning to add it to their treasuries.
Emphasizing the need for businesses and individuals to hold Bitcoin, Draper reportedly compared the cryptocurrency to the discovery of gunpowder.
“It’s a complete change,” he said, according to Decrypt. “You wouldn’t do war the same way after gunpowder; you don’t do commerce the same way after Bitcoin.”
He added that he foresees a future where Bitcoin becomes the standard, not the dollar, reportedly saying, “We’re eventually going to see a time where we’re really not measuring against the dollar, because there won’t be a dollar.”

Beyond advocating for companies and individuals to accumulate Bitcoin, Draper also revealed personal plans to build a small economy around the asset. Specifically, he plans to run an investment fund entirely on the leading cryptocurrency in the next five years.
“I raise it completely in Bitcoin, I invest it in entrepreneurs in Bitcoin, all of them pay their employees and suppliers all in Bitcoin,” he reportedly said.
Draper also said he would leverage the blockchain and smart contracts for bookkeeping and taxation, asserting “the blockchain keeps perfect records.”
According to him, Bitcoin has a “gravitational pull” that is drawing creativity away from altcoins like Ethereum and Solana.
“A lot of the creativity used to be around Ethereum, Solana now most of the engineers and entrepreneurs are driving it toward Bitcoin,” he said, citing the emergence of projects focused on bringing decentralized finance, smart contracts, and collectibles to Bitcoin.
Draper, a Bitcoin permabull who has been predicting that the asset will hit $250,000 since 2018, said this year is the year the asset hits the elusive target. Meanwhile,he recently arguedthat the asset could be “worth an infinite amount of USD.” As of last look, the asset is trading near $103,000, up 6% on the day.

48389,2022-11-07 23:52:30,Bitcoin Mining Major Riot Blockchain Misses Analyst Estimates for Q3 Earnings,"CORRECTION(Nov. 8, 01:02 UTC): A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Riot's consensus analyst estimate was for adjusted net earnings of $1 per share, instead of $0.01.
Bitcoin mining heavyweight Riot Blockchain (RIOT) disappointed average analysts' expectations in its third quarter.
The miner generated $46.3 million in revenues, lower than the average estimate of $56.3 million, bringing net loss to $0.24, compared to a consensus estimate of adjusted net earnings per share of $0.01, according to FactSet.
Riot's revenues were lower than the previous quarter's$72.9 million, and lower than for the same period last year, when the firm reported $64.8 million. The miner attributed the decrease to the declining price of bitcoin and to its curtailing of activities in response to surging energy demand in Texas, according to apress releaseon Monday.
RIOT's share price was down about 1% in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq, following the release of its earnings report.
The miners cash reserves, however, didn't move much compared to the previous quarter, even as other major miners are saying that they are close to bankruptcy. Riot had $255 million of cash on hand and 6,766 BTC at the end of the third quarter, compared to $270.5 million in cash and 6,653 BTC at the end of Q2.
Riot is one of many miners participating in curtailment processes in Texas, under which they power off their machines when demand surges across the electrical grid in exchange for credits they can use later with the local grid operator. Riot earned $13.1 million in such credits throughout the quarter,$9.5 million of which came in July. Its bitcoin production for that month was down 28% as it participated in this so-called demand response program.
The miners'hosting revenue, meaning fees it collects for providing infrastructure to other companies' machines, also decreased quarter-on-quarter from $8.4 million to $9.8 million.
Riot's mining margins have dropped significantly,similar to other miners. In the second quarter of this year, mining revenue in excess of cost of revenues for the segment was $28.2 million, or 61% of revenue from mining. In the third quarter, it was $7.4 million, about 33% of total mining revenue.

The project involves the establishment of a new entity named 21 Capital, which aims to create a publicly listed alternative to existing Bitcoin investment strategies.
Brandon Lutnick, current chair and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and son of former CEO Howard Lutnick, is at the helm of this venture. The initiative will utilize funds from Cantor Equity Partners, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that raised $200 million earlier this year.
The investment contributions to 21 Capital are substantial, with Tether expected to provide $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. SoftBank will contribute $900 million, while Bitfinex plans to supply $600 million worth of the crypto.
This collaboration aims to mirror the investment approach pioneered by Michael Saylor's Strategy, which has seen significant success in the Bitcoin market.
The report highlights that the Bitcoin holdings from these companies will eventually be converted into shares of 21 Capital, valued at $10 per share, suggesting a valuation of $85,000 per Bitcoin. Additionally, Cantor's vehicle plans to raise $350 million through a convertible bond and an additional $200 million via private equity placements for further Bitcoin acquisitions.

""Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,"" he tweeted. ""Do you support this?""
3.5 million twitter accounts voted 57.9% in favour of the move.
Musk, who is the world's richest man, launched the poll in response to criticism he did not pay enough tax, promising to abide by the result.Forbessaid the stock sale would be at least in the 20% range for capital gains tax.
""Note, I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere. I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock,"" Musk tweeted.

It is the latest example of crowd-sourced decision making from the billionaire, whose tweets have moved both the stock price and the price of cryptocurrency bitcoin (BTC-USD) in the past.

Musk recently said on Twitter he'd sell $6bn in Tesla stock and donate it to theWorld Food Programme, provided the organisation would be more transparent about how the money is spent.
“It’s highly unusual for a business leader to canvas social media for opinions over share ownership but Musk has always liked to do things in the public eye,"" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.
“He is so rich that he probably doesn’t care if his actions cause the Tesla price to fall a bit. However, he also has a duty to act in shareholders’ interests which he hasn’t done in this situation because the incident has already destabilised the company’s valuation.”
Some analysts said that, while a huge stock offload is usually seen in a negative light by shareholders, the 10% stock sale would not necessarily move the needle for the company.
Demand remains high for Tesla shares among both institutional and retail investors, Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities told Bloomberg.
Others said that it could lead to short sellers targeting the company.

54853,2021-05-20 05:30:00,"World's ""First Social Media NFT Marketplace"" Set to Hit the Market","BALTIMORE, MD / ACCESSWIRE / May 20, 2021 /Artemishas announced it is set to hit the market with its NFT soon, and wants the world to watch out for it. These days it seems non-fungible tokens (NFT) have become the real deal in the blockchain world. Every day that passes sees more NFT projects launch into this space with many more interesting projects undergoing incubation. Most of these projects look alike but some of them really standout and in all fairness deserve the hype around them. One such NFT project that's determined to disrupt the industry is Artemis.
It was founded by two blockchain gurus: Danny Nunez, who serves as the company's CEO, and Dean Kim, who serves as president. Often described as the world's first social media NFT marketplace, Artemis blows some much needed fresh air over the NFT space. Very obviously, the brains behind this project figured out that it'd make a lot of sense if they created an NFT marketplace that's also a social media platform of some sort.
""Think Amazon and Facebook working together to serve one huge purpose, and you probably get an idea of what the Artemis team have envisaged."" Says Dean Kim, President of Artemis Vision.
In marrying social media to non-fungible tokens, the project's leadership looks to help their users create and collect the NFTs of their dreams even as they discover what looks like an endless stream of possibilities. Again, a casual glance at their website shows the makers of Artemis claim it allows for the creation of all types of NFTs irrespective of what blockchain network the user chooses on its platform.
The CEO, Danny Nunez, went on to add:
""With tons of social media and marketplace features; the Artemis project obviously looks set to explore every advantage that comes with a decentralized atmosphere""
It goes without saying that while Artemis has its own peculiarities and advantages, they probably have to compete with OpenSea and the many much older marketplaces. But that's a topic for another day. Right now, a lot of eyes in theNFT/crypto space are anticipating the launch of this project, which will be on Uniswap.
Reports already show that 3.5 million Artemis Vision (ARV), which is the project's local token, is already minted. That would only be half of its maximum supply for circulation which has been pegged at 7 million. But 1.67 million have been smart locked with Trustswap and will be used for staking on the Artemis platform when that feature launches.
For readers who are just getting to hear about NFTs for the first time, here's an easy way to understand this. Think of an NFT as a digital asset of some sort which is unique and not replaceable. It is like one copy of a collectable artwork which you can own exclusively.
Here's a practical example. If you gave one Bitcoin to your friend, and your sibling gifts you one Bitcoin, you have one Bitcoin still. They're all the same. Identical. However, if you gift or sell a non-fungible token, it's gone. Why? Because there was just one of it in existence.
About Artemis
The Artemis Vision project seems ready to bring a new kind of value to the blockchain community when it launches.
NFT marketplace, social media and token staking represent the bulk of what the project covers at the moment even though its team of developers continue to explore every possibility in the blockchain ecosystem.
You can stay up-to-date with the projecthereor join in theconversation here, both on Telegram. But as always, consumers and participants of the NFT space decide what project gets their loyalty.

GameStop Corp. declined by 10.85 percent on Wednesday to finish at $31.21 apiece as investors resorted to profit-taking following three consecutive days of rally, while repositioning portfolios after pulling the trigger to buy $500 million of Bitcoins.
In a statement, GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) said it purchased 4,710 Bitcoins as it looked to other industries to grow its business.
It can be learned that GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) struggled to remain relevant amid the shifting consumer behavior in the gaming industry, pivoting to digital gaming purchases from physical ones.
A gamer playing a game on one of the specialty retail company's gaming platforms.
Meanwhile, the $500 million forms part of the company’s $1.3 billion Bitcoin purchase program, an amount it planned to raise from offering convertible senior notes.
It can be learned that the gaming company had already ventured into cryptocurrency in 2022 with the establishment of a now-defunct cryptocurrency wallet that sent its share prices skyrocketing for days after the launch.
Overall, GMEranks 5thon our list of worst-performing stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of GME  our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

54229,2022-09-29 19:15:56,Elon Musk laid out his idea for a new blockchain-based social media platform to his brother Kimbal in private texts: 'This could be massive',"Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic/Hannibal Hanschke Pool/Getty Elon Musk told his brother he wanted to build a blockchain-based social media platform, texts reveal. Twitter expressed concern in the past that Musk could use its internal data to build a competitor. The texts were made public in the discovery process during Musk's court battle with Twitter. Elon Musk shared an idea for a potential Twitter competitor with his brother Kimbal Musk ahead of offering to purchase the company, according to a series of private texts that were released amid Musk's court battle with Twitter. ""I think a new social media company is needed that is based on a blockchain and includes payments,"" Musk texted Kimbal Musk on April 10, the same day he announced he would no longer be joining Twitter's board of directors. The billionaire had outlined his idea for the social media company the day before. ""I have an idea for a blockchain social media system that does both payments and short text messages/links like Twitter,"" Musk texted Kimbal Musk on April 9. ""You have to pay a tiny amount to register your message on the chain, which will cut out the vest majority of spam and bots. There is no throat to choke, so free speech is guaranteed."" Musk said the site would have a ""massive real-time database"" that would keep permanent copies of messages and followers and a ""Twitter-like app on your phone"" that can access the database in the cloud. ""This could be massive,"" Musk texted his younger brother. A few days after sending the messages, Musk offered to buy Twitter for $44 billion. Kimbal Musk appeared to support the idea, telling his brother it could be a social media company that cuts back on ads by allowing users to ""pay for use"" and could allow users to vote off scam accounts. ""I'd love to learn more,"" Kimbal Musk responded at the time. ""I've dug deep on Web3 (not crypto as much) and the voting powers are amazing and verified. Lots you could do here for this as well."" ""It drives me crazy when I see people promoting the scam that you're giving away Bitcoin,"" Kimbal Musk wrote. ""Lots of bad people out there."" Story continues The two brothers appeared to meet up to discuss the idea, according to a text from Kimbal Musk on April 11. Musk's righthand man Jared Birchall later presented Musk with recommendations for a software engineer ""to speak with about the blockchain idea"" on April 21. ""Great to hang yesterday,"" Kimbal Musk said. ""I'd love to help think through the structure of the Doge social media idea. Let me know how I can help."" But, the conversation around a ""Doge"" social media platform does not appear again in the publicly available text messages. Twitter has expressed concern in its lawsuit against Musk that the billionaire would use internal data from the company to build a competitor. In August, the Tesla CEO teased his blank website ""X.com"" as a potential Twitter competitor. The text messages were revealed as a part of a trove of unredacted messages between Musk and several of Silicon Valley's most powerful players, including Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, and former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. The messages are part of the pretrial discovery process in the court battle between Twitter and Musk. The five-day trial that will determine whether Musk will be forced to buy Twitter is set to start on October 17.

32880,2019-09-20 13:08:58,Canadian Bitcoin mining firm ramps up capabilities as hashrate rises,"Canadian company Bitfarms has bought 2,500 A10 Avalon miners, to increase its mining capacity. This comes as the Bitcoin hashrate continues tobreak records, making it harder to mine new bitcoins.
The Bitcoin hashrate is a measure of the total computing power of Bitcoin miners around the world, who use computational energy to “mine” new bitcoins.
The new A10’s werelaunchedin March this year, offering high computational power while consuming little power–relative to older models. With 2,500 more mining machines, Bitfarms’ total mining power will rise to 51 Megawatts, a lot of energy but still a drop in the ocean compared to the power the whole Bitcoin network churns through. Digiconomist.com estimates that the Bitcoin network uses 73 Terawatt hours a year.
REPORT: Booming bitcoin mining industry faces crunch point
Bitfarms CEO Wes Fulford, said, in apress release, that the new deliveries will “more than double the hash power reported in the second quarter of 2019.”
Bitcoin miners are having to step up their game in light of increasing competition for new bitcoin rewards. Bitcoin’s hashrate recentlysurpassed100 quintillion hashes per second. That means that miners need to have bigger and more powerful machines in order to profit from mining Bitcoin.
With this in mind, Canada’s Bitcoin mining industry has been doubling down on mining equipment and energy supplies. Blockstream, a Canadian blockchain company known for its work on the Bitcoin Lightning Network, created a mining pool with utility providerHydro Quebecback in August. And Hydro Quebecpromisedearlier this year to keep energy cheap for crypto miners, setting aside hundreds of megawatts for a handful of companies.
In fact, lots of big mining companies, likeBitmainandInnosilicon, are failing to meet demand for miners caused by the rising price of Bitcoin. Major mining retailers are sold out as they struggle to deliver on backlogs of orders, according to arecent report.
Currently, Bitcoin miners are alreadyspendinghalf a million dollars an hour to keep the network running. Which seems a lot but is still lower than the $750,000 that they can take home in block rewards (with transaction fees on top of that).",10200.84,0.01,10199.99,-0.0,10194.01,-0.06,10170.35,-0.29,10200.24
56542,2022-01-13 14:29:19,"Bitcoin adoption for countries is a 'high stakes' game and more governments will buy the cryptocurrency this year to stay competitive, Fidelity says","• More governments and even a central bank could buy bitcoin in 2022, according to Fidelity.
• The investment firm said a high stakes game theory is at play that could lead to further adoption.
• ""If bitcoin increases, the countries that secure some bitcoin today will be better off competitively than their peers,"" Fidelity said.
• Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.
More countries and even a central bank could followEl Salvador's leadand adoptbitcoinas a form of legal tender and add it to its balance sheet, Fidelity said ina note last week.
The investment firm believes a high stakes game theory is playing out that would leave early adopters of the cryptocurrency better off than their peers.
""If bitcoin adoption increases, the countries that secure some bitcoin today will be better off competitively than their peers. Therefore, even if other countries do not believe in the investment thesis or adoption of bitcoin, they will be forced to acquire some as a form of insurance,"" Fidelity explained.
El Salvadorbecame the first country in 2021 to adopt bitcoin,with the country giving free bitcoin to its citizens and making it mandatory that all businesses accept bitcoin as a form of payment, in addition to traditional fiat.
For now, El Salvador's adoption of bitcoin doesn't look like a home run, solely based on the price of bitcoin, which has fallen about 40% from its mid-November high. One report suggeststhe country has lost about $10 millionon its bitcoin purchases due to the recent decline.
But China is taking the opposite approach by implementing various bans on the mining and trading of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. That's a big mistake, according to Fidelity.
""It isn't surprising that we think an outright ban will be difficult to achieve at best, and if successful, will lead to a significant loss of wealth and opportunity,"" the note said.
One milestone that has the potential to validate bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is recent regulations targeting the sector that wasincluded in November's US infrastructure bill.The rules impacting crypto don't go into effect until 2024, and there is potential for various amendments targeting the legislation between now and then, Fidelity noted.
""But what we think is most notable is that digital asset regulation becoming law is another milestone as the asset class comes of age and establishes itself,"" Fidelity explained.
Ultimately, countries that are bitcoin curious could pay a small cost today and adopt it as a hedge compared to a potentially larger cost years in the future.
""We therefore wouldn't be surprised to see other sovereign nation states acquire bitcoin in 2022 and perhaps even see a central bank make an acquisition,"" Fidelity concluded.

46863,2022-06-13 13:00:14,5 Things You Should Always Pay For With Cash,"Banks issue rewards credit cards for all kinds of spending categories, from flights, hotels, rental cars and entertainment to groceries, dining, warehouse clubs and e-commerce. With all of those ways to benefit from using credit -- and with cash having such a 20th-century feel in today's digital economy -- it's easy to write off old-school money as obsolete. Those green paper rectangles, after all, are one of the last remaining payment methods that don't pay you back.
Cash App Borrow:How To Borrow Money on Cash AppLearn:9 Bills You Should Never Put on Autopay
In most cases, that's probably true -- but there are still a few times and places in the era of Bitcoin and Venmo where it still makes more sense touse cold, hard cashto complete your transaction. In every case except one, it's services -- not products -- where cash favors the buyer.
Here's a look at the small handful of remaining transactions that you should conduct with cash as the medium of exchange -- or expect to pay more if you don't.
Big-time expenditures such as paying for college might seem like the perfect time to swipe your card and rake in beaucoup bucks in the form of points, miles, cash back or other rewards.
The bursar's office, however, is one place where you don't want to bust out the plastic.
About 85% of colleges and universities now accept credit cards as payment, according to CNBC -- but the privilege usually comes with a 2% to 3% surcharge. Presuming 2.5%, that's a $250 fee on a $10,000 tuition bill. That kind of upcharge will quickly chew away at any rewards you were imagining earning. Top cash-back cards such as Citi Double Cash, for example, pay cardholders only 2%.
Poll:How Much Do You Expect To Spend on Travel This Summer?
Most states no longer restrict merchants from charging extra to customers who pay with credit to cover the fees that credit card processing companies charge for every swipe -- those surcharges can be as high as 4%.
According to Pymnts, small businesses widely adopted credit card surcharges -- often advertised as ""cash discounts"" -- as soon as the states began allowing them to do so. While the healthcare industry had long lagged behind, that's all changing now that new technology is making it easier for doctors, dentists, hospitals and other healthcare providers to build the cost of using a credit card into their price structures.
Even the handful of states that still forbid retailers from charging credit card surcharges generally make an exception for government offices, which are usually allowed to pass the cost of credit card processing on to you.
That means it's almost always cheaper to use cash at your local DMV, post office or when making payments at your local court.
Nowhere is the difference between the cash price and credit card price more obvious than at the gas station. That, according to The Sun, is because they're among the only businesses that sell just one product.
Before 2013, when Visa and Mastercard began allowing merchants to charge customers a fee for paying with a credit card, gas stations offered a cash discount. Today, however, most gas stations simply advertise two different prices side by side -- a lower price for cash and a higher price for credit.
If you find that you owe Uncle Sam a bill when tax season rolls around, you'll want to pay what you owe in the form of a direct ACH payment straight from your checking account. Paying your taxes with plastic -- including debit cards -- will cost you even more, and who in history has ever wanted to pay more than they owe to the IRS?
If you do, for whatever reason, opt for paying your taxes with a card, the IRS uses three payment processors, all of which have different price structures:
• ACI Payments:$2.20 for debit card transactions, 1.98% with a minimum fee of $2.50 for credit cards
• Pay1040:$2.50 or 1.87% for debit cards, depending on the type of card, and 1.87% for credit cards with a minimum fee of $2.50
• payUSAtax:$2.55 for debit cards, 1.96% with a minimum fee of $2.69 for credit cards.

Most Read from Bloomberg YouTube and Spotify Won’t Launch Apple Vision Pro Apps, Joining Netflix Blinken’s Return From Davos Was Delayed After Plane Broke Down Trump Moves to Quash Hopes of Congress Ukraine, Border Deal Trump Asks Supreme Court to Keep Him on Colorado Ballot Airstrikes on Yemen Bring New Level of Chaos to Shipping in the Southern Red Sea Jain Global had originally hoped to top ExodusPoint Capital Management’s prior $8 billion launch, to become the largest-ever hedge fund startup. A spokesperson for Jain Global declined to comment. Jain has already slashed fees to make backing his fund more attractive, granting those who commit at least $250 million a discounted 10% performance fee indefinitely. The firm has been 2024’s most anticipated launch, and the lowered expectations underscore how challenging fundraising has become for the industry. Jain —— who was co-chief investment officer at Izzy Englander’s Millennium Management — has spent months courting Middle East sovereign wealth funds and other large allocators of capital. But investors have become more cautious after being burned by too much private equity exposure last year. It’s particularly tough for multistrategy funds, which posted middling returns last year and face scrutiny over high leverage and crowded trades. If he raises $5 billion, Jain Global could still achieve one of the largest launches of 2024. That could rival a fund being launched by former Millennium senior trader Diego Megia, who’s on track to start his shop with as much as $5 billion — of which $3 billion is coming from Englander’s firm. The Financial Times reported Jain Global’s new fund target earlier. Jain is expected to launch his firm in July and has so far built a team of about 80 people.

Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results
• Cash and cash equivalents were $961.4 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to $526.4 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to net proceeds from the PIPE financing and share option exercises, offset by cash used in operating activities.
• R&D expenses were $40.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $39.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in expense of $0.4 million was primarily due to increased clinical program expenses for zelenectide pevedotin development and increased personnel-related expenses, offset by decreased clinical program expenses for Bicycle TICA®molecule development, decreased discovery, platform and other expenses and incremental U.K. R&D tax credits.
• General and administrative expenses were $15.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $14.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase of $1.1 million was primarily due to increased personnel-related costs.
• Net loss was $39.8 million, or $(0.77) basic and diluted net loss per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net loss of $42.6 million or $(1.41) basic and diluted net loss per share, for three months ended June 30, 2023.

25654,2021-07-08 09:05:37,Crypto latest: Bitcoin price under pressure,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) slumped on Thursday after days of consolidation and low volatility.
The world’s most popular cryptocurrency fell as much as 7% to $32,408 (£23,521), down more than 40% since its $64,000 peak in April as pressure mounted.
Over the last week bitcoin has failed to break above $36,000, but it has also managed to keep above $32,000, bouncing between the narrow range. It has recently been unable to either break upwards or correct downwards.
Other cryptos followed suit, with Ethereum (ETH-USD) down almost 9% after a recent rally, and Elon Musk favourite Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) down as much as 9% on the day.
The crypto market has struggled to recapture the momentum seen earlier in the year. A record high for bitcoin spurred the broader market to reach a value of more than $2tn.
Today the cryptocurrency market is worth $1.4tn, a 6% decrease over the last day, according to the latest figures fromCoinMarketCap.
Bitcoin's high was driven by increased institutional adoption and boosterism from the likes of Tesla (TSLA), as well as several organisations including MicroStrategy (MSTR), which invested billions of dollars into cryptocurrencies.
Traditional financial firms such as PayPal (PYPL) and Goldman Sachs (GS) also started to handle the asset on behalf of clients.
However, stalling momentum coincided witha crackdown in China,growing concerns about Bitcoin's energy use, andwaning enthusiasm from Musk.
Watch: What is bitcoin?
Cryptos have faced staunch opposition from governments and central banks which have been keen to regulate digital currencies.
The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has previously warned that if consumers invest in cryptoassets ""they should be prepared to lose all their money"". Last month the FCA issued a warning to consumers that one of the world’s largest bitcoin exchanges was not permitted to undertake regulated activities in the UK.
It ordered Binance Markets to remove all advertising and financial promotions by 30 June.

The company was required to make clear on its website, social media platforms and all other communications that it is no longer permitted to operate in the UK, and must not carry out any regulated activities in Britain without prior consent.
Two days ago, Barclays (BARC.L) said its customers will no longer be able to make credit or debit card payments to the crypto exchange after the ban.
The bank said: “Barclays intends to stop credit and debit card payments to Binance. This action does not impact on the ability of customers to withdraw funds from Binance. The decision has been taken following the FCA warning to consumers, to help keep our customers’ money safe.”",32579.55,-0.05,32500.0,-0.3,32607.31,0.03,32607.28,0.03,32597.13
20275,2018-02-24 00:06:00,Can Showtime Survive as a Stand-Alone Product?,"CBS(NYSE: CBS)is ahead of schedule in itsover-the-top (OTT)plans, but it still trailsTime Warner's(NYSE: TWX)HBO.
CBS announced it reached 5 million OTT subscribers about evenly split between Showtime and CBS All Access. That's up from about 3 million a year ago. CBS CFO Joe Ianniello said CBS is ahead of its plans to reach 8 million subscribers between the two services by 2020.
HBO, meanwhile, just posted itsbest year ever, adding about 3 million new subscribers to HBO Now. That's three times as many net additions as either Showtime or All Access while charging a higher price. Investors need to understand where the discrepancy comes from and how it might impact CBS going forward.
Image source: Showtime.
Both CBS and HBO's better-than-expected results stem from the secular growth of over-the-top streaming.
Virtual multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) grew significantly in 2017 while cord-cutting continued to accelerate. These virtual MVPDs use the OTT alternatives to HBO and Showtime to make distribution easier; HBO and CBS handle delivering content to subscribers, saving the video distributor some money. As such, HBO and CBS get to keep a larger share of revenue.
CBS has also been bundling Showtime and CBS All Access with other streaming services. You can bundle Showtime with Hulu,AmazonPrime, or even with CBS All Access. HBO also has a partnership with Amazon. HBO Now gets about half of its subscribers from Amazon Prime Channels, while Showtime gets the vast majority of its subscribers through Prime Channels and Hulu bundles, according to BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield.
HBO got an additional boost last year whenAT&Topted tobundle HBOwith its unlimited wireless data plans. If a subscriber didn't have a pay-TV subscription from one of AT&T's services, they could take HBO Now.
Both companies have historically relied on the cable bundle for distribution, and they're still relying on others to help distribute their products in an over-the-top world.
HBO has considerable brand strength to support it in a stand-alone world. As more and more consumers cut the cord, it's not clear Showtime will show the same resilience.
In 2017, HBO added 5 million domestic subscribers between HBO and Cinemax with the vast majority of those new subscribers coming for HBO.Meanwhile, CBS doesn't provide an update on its Showtime subscriber growth, and a change in how it counts subscribers obfuscates its progress. The count for CBS' premium cable networks was decreasing through midyear, but management said specifically that Showtime subscribers increased this year -- surpassing 25 million for the first time -- without providing any other details.
It seems that HBO has more strength to survive as a stand-alone service. Even if it relies on other distributors and bundles, HBO is growing faster than ever thanks largely to the strength of its brand and product.
As more people cut the cord and leave traditional cable bundles, it seems as though CBS and Showtime will have a more difficult time building a robust base. Although OTT subscribers may not be enough to offset those losses, it's not necessarily a harbinger of doom, either. CBS keeps more revenue from OTT subscribers than one signing up through a distributor, and the increased revenue share may help lessen the blow of decreasing overall subscriber counts. But whether that will be enough to make Showtime a successful stand-alone product long term remains to be seen.

3713,2017-09-12 22:13:00,Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin Slumps as Dimon Says Bitcoin Will 'blow up',"Bitcoin fell sharply on Tuesday Investing.com – Bitcoin fell sharply on Tuesday after J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. boss Jamie Dimon warned that bitcoin “is a fraud” and “will eventually blow up”. On the U.S.-based Bitfinex exchange, bitcoin fell to $4,108.1, down $93.7 or 2.23%, well below its recent peak of $4,969. At current prices Bitcoin boasts a market cap of $67.7 billion. “Bitcoin will eventually blow up. It’s a fraud. It’s worse than tulip bulbs and won’t end well,” Dimon said at a banking industry conference organized by Barclays (LON:BARC). Dimon’s warning comes amid a period of uncertainty in the cryptocurrency space after several reports suggested that Chinese regulators were planning to shut down local cryptocurrency exchanges. “China’s central bank, working with other regulators, has drafted instructions banning Chinese platforms from providing virtual currency trading services”, the Wall Street Journal said Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. China’s largest bitcoin exchanges, however, have been reluctant to elaborate on the matter as no official notice has been received from regulators. The latest crackdown on cryptocurrency activity in China comes a week after the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, imposing a ban on individuals and businesses from raising funds through initial coin offerings (ICOs). An initial coin offering ICO is a means fundraising via the use of cryptocurrency in which a company attracts investors by releasing its own digital currency which can appreciate in value if the business is successful. The string of recent measures proposed by China to curb the use of cryptocurrencies has unsettled investors as strong demand from Far East has been a key factor supporting cryptocurrency growth. Bitcoin Cash fell $23.69, or 4.27%, to $531.21, while Ethereum fell 3.13% to $287.91.

32542,2021-10-21 18:09:53,One Last Pullback to $53K Before Bitcoin Targets $90K?,"Two weeks ago, seehere, whenBitcoin(BTC) was trading at $55K, I concluded, “the preferred view remains BTC is now in a new bull run to new all-time highs, with an ideal target of $90K+“. However, I was looking for to rally to top out at around $57-60K, followed by a drop to approximately $51K and then another rally to the long-term target of $90K+, which btw will still not be “THE TOP.”
Fast forward, BTC reached $66980 yesterday and is seeing a solid reversal today. Thus my (red) intermediate wave-i top target was a bit off as quite the margin exceeded it. The exceedance is, based on the “Elliott Wave Principle (EWP)waves, because the cryptocurrency experienced a subdividing, 3rdand 5thwave. See Figure 1 below.
Figure 1. Bitcoin daily charts with detailed EWP count and technical indicators.
Such extensions can always happen, must be anticipated, but cannot be known with certainty beforehand. They fall under the good old “in bull markets upside surprises and downside disappoints” theme. How to trade that? Don’t sell your entire position in anticipation of a pullback, but raise stops and maybe take some chips off the table, but not all. For example, my crypto trading alert bot service does just that. For instance, it went long on October 1 at $48165. It sold ¼ positions in three batches on the way up, and now its subscribers to it are still only holding ¼ of the original position, with a stop at $49502 and depending on the trading system signals, this easy trade netted so far an easy +18%.
A break below Sunday’s $59016 low is needed to confirm wave-ii to ideally $53K.
Figure 1 shows several technical indicators, and one of the most important ones is IMHO the Money Flow Indicator (MFI14) at the bottom of the page. It has been highly overbought over the last several days, meaning everyone has bought BTC. And when everybody has bought, only selling is left. In addition, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index sits currently at 84: extreme greed.
Thus, some selling would be typical to take care of these powerful Bullish readings. Besides, such strong MFI readings tell there’s plenty of liquidity going into the cryptocurrency, and liquidity is what drives markets. In over 9 out of 10 occasions where the MFI14 gets this overbought, we can expect a pullback and then higher prices again.
These readings fit with the preferred EWP count that wave-ii of wave-3 of wave-V of Cycle-3 is about to commence. See figure 1 above. Since (black) major wave-2 did a 50% retrace of wave-1, I (logically?!) expect wave-ii to also retrace about 50% of wave-i in the coming days. That will bring BTC’s price back to around $53K, which is horizontal support. From around that price level, I expect wave-iii of wave-3 to start targeting $90K+ideally. Mypremium crypto trading membersknow the exact target zones, even for all of wave-3 and Cycle-3. A break below Sunday’s $59016 low is needed to confirm wave-ii to ideally $53K is underway.
Bottom line:Bitcoin’s rally to yesterday’s all-time high (ATH) surpassed my initial anticipation of a local top around $57-60K as the 3rdand 5thwave of the larger wave-i I was tracking extended. However, the anticipated pattern of a “rally, pullback, rally” remains intact.
The first “rally” came and likely went, and now I anticipate the “pullback.” Money flow and sentiment are extremely overbought/bullish, suggesting some selling should be expected. I expect this pullback to reach around $53K+/-2K before the rally to $90K starts. BTC will have to break below $48K to begin to suggest something much more bearish is afoot, whereas continued ATHs will mean the mother of all cryptos is already in wave-iii of 3 and ready to target $78K more directly. Neither option, albeit possible, is my preferred path.

Transparent PnL Reporting The platform shows PnL as Net PnL, providing a clear and honest view of a trade’s outcome, after accounting for any fees. Traders can see the actual fees before opening a trade and see the fees while the trade is open. Gross PnL is shown as well. Understanding Fees and Real Yield Swych PDEX operates on a real yield fee system, designed to sustain the platform while rewarding its users. This system not only ensures the smooth operation of the exchange but also contributes to the generation of real yield for the investors. Here’s a breakdown of the fee structure and how it ties into the concept of real yield. Exchange Fees Explained The fee structure of Swych PDEX is carefully adjusted to balance the need for operational sustainability to reward its users. It’s a model that reflects the platform’s commitment to creating a mutually beneficial ecosystem for all its stakeholders. Position Fee: Swych PDEX charges a 0.1% fee for perpetual trading. This fee is applied to each trade. Liquidation Fee: A nominal charge of $5 is levied as a liquidation fee. This fee is incurred when a position is liquidated, which usually happens when the market moves against a leveraged position beyond a certain threshold. Dynamic Borrowing Fee: This fee is calculated as (assets borrowed) / (total assets in the pool) * 0.01%, with a cap of 0.01% per hour at full pool utilization. This fee structure is for managing the liquidity and risk associated with leveraged trading. Execution Fees: Swych PDEX maintains minimal execution fees, set between 0.0025 as the minimum and maximum. These fees are essential for executing trades on the platform and are kept minimal to encourage trading activity. The Concept of Real Yield The real yield on Swych PDEX refers to the actual earnings users receive from the exchange, derived from the various trading fees collected. Unlike hypothetical or projected returns, real yield represents tangible income generated from platform activities. This yield is a crucial aspect of Swych PDEX’s business value proposition, as users not only engage in trading activities but also become beneficiaries of the platform’s success through real yield distribution. Revenue Distribution Swych PDEX implements a strategic fee revenue distribution system, ensuring operational sustainability while rewarding its community and investors. This approach reflects a commitment to balance operational needs with the benefits provided to platform users. Here’s an overview of how the fee revenue is allocated: Allocation of Collected Fees Treasury: 5% of the fees are allocated to the protocol’s treasury. This is for the ongoing maintenance and development of the platform, ensuring its smooth operation and continuous improvement. Lottery: 10% of the collected fees are directed towards the lottery mechanism. This feature adds an element of excitement and additional earning potential for the platform’s users. Investors: Swych PDEX allocates 35% of the fees to its stakeholders. This distribution underlines the platform’s commitment to providing real yield and returns to those who invest in it. Liquidity: 50% of the fees are allocated back into the exchange itself. By reinvesting this portion into the platform’s liquidity, Swych PDEX ensures robust market health and ongoing liquidity provision. This is important for maintaining efficient market operations and enhancing the platform’s overall performance between trading pairs. Focused on Balanced Growth This distribution model is a cornerstone of Swych PDEX’s strategy to create a sustainable and thriving ecosystem. It balances the need to cover operational costs and invest in future development to provide tangible benefits to its community and stakeholders. Note that the percentage weights above may change and move more rewards towards stakeholders. As the platform continues to grow, this approach positions Swych PDEX as a forward-thinking player in DeFi, prioritizing both platform stability and user rewards. Trading Incentive Program Swych PDEX will soon introduce another initiative, designed to reward traders based on their trading volume. This volume-based promotion is a feature that incentivizes active trading on the platform, providing tangible rewards for traders who engage frequently in market activities. Here’s a closer look at how this program works: Mechanics of the Volume-Based Promotion Incentive Structure: For every $25,000 in trading volume, the trader is rewarded with $10 in USDT. This reward system is designed to encourage higher trading activity, offering a direct monetary benefit to active users. Calculation of Trading Volume: The trading volume is determined by the formula: volume = collateral x leverage. This means the volume is calculated based on the amount of collateral a trader uses, multiplied by the leverage applied to their trades. Example Let’s consider an example to understand how this works in a practical scenario: Scenario: Ia trader decides to open a position in ETH. They use $1,000 of collateral and apply a leverage of 10x. Volume Calculation: In this case, the trading volume would be $1,000 (collateral) x 10 (leverage) = $10,000. Incentive Accrual: Since the trader has generated $10,000 in volume, they are partway to reaching the $25,000 threshold for the reward. Once their cumulative trading volume reaches $25,000, they would receive $10 in USDT. There is no cap as to how many times a user can qualify for the $10 reward. This program is especially appealing to high-frequency traders or those who trade with significant volumes, as it offers an additional financial perk on top of potential trading profits. It’s an innovative approach that not only fosters increased trading activity on the platform but also adds an extra layer of reward for Swych PDEX users.

Those customers included nine cryptocurrency exchanges, 88 institutional investors and 38 other types of crypto customers. Q1 net income was $12.7 million, up 40% over Q4.
Crypto firms are often a rich source of low-cost deposits for the few banks that openly serve the sector. In Q1, Silvergate’s average cost of deposits was 0.00%. In contrast, average deposit costs for mid-cap commercial banks are normally around 0.75% to 1.25%.

86230,2025-01-29 14:18:00,"Got $3,000? Buy These 2 Cryptocurrencies Right Now.","With an ongoing crypto bull market and widespread interest in the asset class among everyone from retirement investors to the government, now's a great time to think about starting a position in some of the sector's leaders.
If you're looking to make a medium-size cryptocurrency investment on the order of $3,000, many options are out there, but two in particular stand out for the balance between risk and reward they offer. Let's analyze each and appreciate why they could be worthy of your investment.
Many investors are familiar with the Solana platform, which is becoming widely known as the place formeme coininvesting.
But rather than merely trying to find the meme coins that will take off, most investors would probably be better off holding the chain's mainSolana(CRYPTO: SOL)coin. It's been a lucrative holding recently: The coin's value is up 176% in the last three years, dramatically outperforming most of the other top cryptocurrencies.
More importantly,several catalystsin the coming year or so could send its price soaring, including the potential approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold the Solana coin. The potential inclusion of the coin in a U.S. cryptocurrency reserve is another juicy possibility.
Even if those catalysts don't come to be, there's still a strong investment thesis for holding Solana. Investors need to buy the chain's main coin to speculate on meme coins or decentralized finance projects on it, both of which are highly popular and likely to become even more so as more people enter the ecosystem. They also need to hold it to pay for non-fungible token (NFT) minting fees and transactions on the chain, not to mention any smart contracts or programs they want to implement. And the volume on the chain, worth around $5.4 billion as of Jan. 25, makes it clear that a lot is happening there, even during weekends and other periods when volume is traditionally lower.
Then there's the fact that Donald and Melania Trump recently launched meme coins on Solana, drawing many thousands of new users and their dollars to the platform. If that's not an endorsement of the chain's merits, particularly its approachability and ease of use, not much is.
It's true that the Solana coin's price can be volatile. But if you're willing to hold for a handful of years to get the boost from these potential catalysts and the adoption of the chain, the day-to-day volatility shouldn't bother you much.
If you don't already holdBitcoin,(CRYPTO: BTC), there's no time like the present to get involved, even if you're only going to allocate half of your $3,000.
In addition to being exposed to many of the same catalysts as Solana, Bitcoin is likely to be included in any government cryptocurrency stash because it's the oldest, largest, and most widely distributed crypto asset. The idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve was floated before the wider idea of a national cryptocurrency repository took hold.
The biggest reason to invest in Bitcoin is that it's a currency that should retain its purchasing power regardless of inflation, as there's a hard cap on the number of coins that can be created. Its value may also withstand financial disruptions, though that idea hasn't been tested.
Furthermore, given that its price has exhibited a cyclical pattern of downs followed by ups due to regular halvings of the mining reward, it's highly likely that it will continue to gain in value over the long term. While investing in Bitcoin right now makes sense, if you're a bit leery, it's also a perfect candidate for dollar-cost averaging, which would grant you the full benefit of long-term price appreciation while mitigating the risk of weekly price fluctuations.
In other words, you don'thaveto invest your full Bitcoin allotment today. You could invest a little bit every week or every month until you've reached your target position size, then sit back and hold it for years and years.

45796,2022-09-22 10:10:19,Crypto Shakeout Engulfs the C-Suite as CEOs Start Stepping Down,"(Bloomberg) -- The cryptocurrency industry’s epic shakeout, having cost thousands of jobs and set off a round of consolidation, is reaching the corner office.

Crypto exchange Kraken announced on Wednesday that co-founder Jesse Powell will step down as CEO, to be replaced by Chief Operating Officer David Ripley. The reshuffle comes shortly after Genesis’s Michael Moro and Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor, along with Sam Trabucco of Alameda Research, relinquished top positions.
The raft of successions sets the stage for a changing of the guard in the roughly decade-old industry. Many of crypto’s most prominent leaders, like Powell, are technologists who discovered digital assets early, cultivated devout Twitter followings and didn’t hesitate to engage their detractors in online battles. With the sector reeling from a slump that’s shaved off roughly $2 trillion from cryptocurrencies’ market value and landed some bosses in bankruptcy court, regulators’ cross-hairs or worse, boards are starting to look for different skills.
“If there is a firm in complete crisis and meltdown, you need an adult in the room, and you need that adult in the room to understand regulation and compliance,” said Deepali Vyas, who leads executive search for areas including crypto at Korn Ferry.
Vyas is currently looking for CEOs for a crypto exchange and a crypto miner which she declined to identify, and she expects more C-suite changes throughout the industry in the fall.
Insiders Take Over
This wave of changes started in earnest in early August with Saylor, who founded MicroStrategy in 1989, giving up his CEO title to focus more on Bitcoin -- even after his buying of the token led to a $918 million second-quarter impairment charge. Two weeks later, Moro stepped down as CEO of Genesis, the crypto brokerage stung by exposure to defunct hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.
On Aug. 24, Alameda co-CEO Trabucco announced that he’s stepping down to “prioritize other things.” Like at Kraken, insiders are taking over at MicroStrategy and Alameda, while Genesis appointed Chief Operating Officer Derar Islim as interim CEO while it searches for a permanent replacement.
Powell, 42, said his decision to step down was more than a year in the making, and driven in part by a desire to deal with “personal stuff.” He plans to devote “maybe 40 hours a week instead of 80 hours” to Kraken, he said in an interview, adding that he’ll focus more on products and advocacy and less on management.
“This will allow me to have more time to work on the things that I really enjoy doing and where I’m strongest,” Powell said. “And not do the stuff that I really don’t enjoy, which is managing a huge team.”
Founder-Influencers
In June, the New York Times published an article that said Powell had “ignited a culture war” among Kraken’s employees through comments some saw as “hurtful.” On June 15, the day the Times’s story ran, Powell published a Twitter thread that said, among other things, that about 20 Kraken workers were “totally not on board” with its corporate culture.
Replacing founders carries its own set of risks.
“They tend to have this incredible ability to influence the community or engage developers. That is very important in crypto,” said Stefan Cohen, a partner at Bain Capital Crypto, an investment fund focused on early-stage protocol projects and investor in BlockFi and MakerDAO. “It’s very hard to move these people out and I don’t think you’d really want to.”
Most crypto board members and investors are used to the volatile nature of the asset class and so tend to be less inclined to blame management in a “down cycle,” Cohen said.
That said, crypto is changing in ways that will likely drive further changes in companies’ top ranks. After market calamities ranging from the implosion of a major stablecoin in May to several crypto lenders around the world going bankrupt in the following months, regulators are determined to tame the industry and pre-empt what they perceive as potential risks to the wider financial system.
Crypto Rules Crackdown Looms for $150 Billion Stablecoin Market
Already, some crypto CEOs facing regulatory action are facing restive shareholders. Some investors in Zipmex Pte, the crypto exchange against which Thailand’s securities regulator has filed a police complaint, have urged CEO Marcus Lim to step down, Bloomberg reported in August.
Monetary Policy Threat
Add to that the biggest overhang not just for crypto, but all global markets: Central bankers led by the Federal Reserve who were arguably late in identifying persistent global inflation and are now moving fast to make sure it doesn’t become too entrenched. Their efforts in tightening monetary policy have set in motion the collapse in digital-asset prices that laid bare much of the industry’s hidden risks.
The Fed’s latest salvo came Wednesday. The US central bank raised benchmark interest rates by 75 basis points and signaled no letup in its fight against inflation.
“With the extreme market volatility and what has happened over the last few months, and given the looming macroeconomic conditions, this is a time where you’re seeing a lot of exits,” Vyas of Korn Ferry said.
One job that might need filling in the next few years: running Binance Holdings Ltd., operator of the world’s biggest crypto exchange.
Binance’s billionaire CEO and co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has indicated that he may step aside within five years to become chairman. “I’ve been CEO of Binance for five years. I don’t think a CEO should be longer than 10 years,” Zhao said on a July podcast with Bankless. “So I think somewhere between now and five years later, I should retire.”
A Binance spokesperson told Bloomberg News that Zhao “believes strongly that fresh ideas, especially for top leadership, is essential” and “succession planning and a robust cadre of top leaders is something that CZ has always kept as a priority and Binance has had training programs and strategies around this since the beginning.”
Asked about Coinbase Global Inc. CEO Brian Armstrong’s succession plan, a spokesperson for the crypto exchange pointed to the company’s April proxy statement, which says the board’s nominating and corporate governance committee -- consisting of venture-capital luminaries Katie Haun, Fred Wilson and Marc Andreessen -- regularly evaluates succession planning for senior positions, including the CEO.
FTX declined to comment on succession plans for CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.

45978,2018-09-06 03:58:07,"Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 06/09/18","Bitcoin Cash tumbled by 15.93% on Wednesday, following a 0.37% fall on Tuesday, to end the day at $526.8, the start of September proving to be dire for the majors, Bitcoin Cash in the red on each of the first three days of this month.
Bitcoin Cash had a relatively range bound start to the day, rising to an early morning intraday high $633 before easing back to $620 levels, the first major resistance level at $645.87 left untested on the day.
A late morning broad based market sell-off saw Bitcoin Cash slide through the major support levels to a morning low $553.5 before getting hit by a second wave late in the day, falling to an intraday low $523.1 before steadying.
The slide in Bitcoin Cash and the broader market was attributed to news of Goldman Sachs putting its planned opening of a cryptocurrency trading desk on hold, suggesting that there may be less institutional money on its way into the cryptomarket than previously assumed, negative news doing the damage on the day.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash was down 2.98% to $511, with Wednesday’s sell-off spilling into the early hours, Bitcoin Cash falling from a start of a day morning high $526.8 to a morning low $487.8 before moving back to $500 levels, support at day’s first major support level at $488.93 kicking in.
For the day ahead, a move back through the morning high to $560 levels would support a run at the day’s first major resistance level at $598.83 to bring $600 levels into play, though we will expect Bitcoin Cash to face plenty of resistance on any attempts to break out from $560.
Failure to move back through the morning high to $560 levels could see Bitcoin Cash take another hit later in the day, with a pullback to sub-$500 levels to call on support at the first major support level at $488.93 for a second time in play should sentiment fail to improve later in the day.
Litecoin slid by 14.83% on Wednesday, reversing Tuesday’s 3.66% gain, to end the day at $57.7.
Following a range bound start to the day, Litecoin slid through the day’s first major support level at $65.57 and second major support level at $63.39 to a morning low $60.88 before a second sell-off late in the day saw Litecoin slide through the third major support level at $59.27 to an intraday low $57.41.
At the time of writing, Litecoin was down 3.92% to $55.42, Litecoin sliding to an early morning low $53.79 to call on support at the first major support level at $53.96 before recovering to $55 levels.
For the day ahead, a move back through an early morning high $57.75 would support a run at $60 levels, while we will expect Litecoin to steer clear of the day’s first major resistance level at $64.9 on the day, the broader market needing to settle from the latest sell-off.
Failure to move back through the start of the day morning high $57.75 could see Litecoin take a bigger hit later in the day, with a pullback through the first major support level at $53.96 likely to bring the second major support level at $50.21 and sub-$50 levels into play before any recovery.
Ripple’s XRP fell for a 4thconsecutive day on Wednesday, tumbling 15.49% to $0.27921, with sub-$0.30 levels hit for the first time since 17thAugust.
Tracking the broader market, Ripple’s XRP slid through the day’s major support levels to a morning low $0.29683 before taking a hit later in the day, with Ripple’s XRP sliding to an intraday low $0.278 before steadying.
At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up 2.1% to $0.28474, Ripple’s XRP recovering from a start of a day morning low $0.26698 to a morning high $0.29227 before easing back to sub-$0.29 levels, the moves through the early part of the day leaving major support and resistance levels untested.
For the day ahead, a move back through the morning high $0.29227 to $0.2969 would support a run at $0.30 levels, while we would expect Ripple’s XRP to steer clear of the day’s first major resistance level at $0.3158, with Ripple’s XRP likely to face plenty of resistance on any run at $0.30 levels.
Failure to move back through the morning high to $0.2969 could see Ripple’s XRP reverse early gains, with a pullback through the morning low $0.26698 bringing the day’s first major support level at $0.2603 back into play, sentiment across the broader market to dictate whether more material declines can be avoided.

95425,2024-04-03 18:51:17,Defending Goldman Sachs’ Latest Crypto Criticism,"The crypto ecosystem is quick to condemn public crypto skepticism from under-informed traditional finance experts who should, we reasonably conclude, know better. We’ve seen this happen over the past few days with the reaction to comments given by Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs Asset & Wealth Management, in a recentWall Street Journal interview.
I’m not going to add to the criticism here, satisfying as that may be. Instead, I’m going to try to defend her statements. To be clear, I deeply disagree with most of them – but I also believe that better understanding opposing views makes us stronger advocates for crypto’s potential. Plus, it brings down the irritation level, which is good for overall well-being. And it’s a fun mental exercise.
Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading, and host of the CoinDesk Markets Daily podcast. This article is excerpted from herCrypto Is Macro Nownewsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.
Let’s start with the bigger picture and some background.
First, Mossavar-Rahmani has an impressive investment pedigree – including 31 years at Goldman Sachs – that can’t have been easy, and deserves respect.
Second, she does not represent all of Goldman Sachs, which has about 40,000 employees around the world. She is the head of the Asset & Wealth Management Division, which is distinct from Sales & Trading and Investment Banking, both of which are involved in the crypto ecosystem.
Third, some crypto media outlets are shrieking that Goldman Sachs is now “under pressure” or “facing heat” because of Ms. Mossavar-Rahmani’s comments. I very much doubt that Goldman Sachs cares about crypto outrage, and its wealth management clients can find crypto exposure elsewhere, if they want it.
Yet, since her voice does carry weight among investment managers, especially those looking for an excuse to not bother learning about crypto assets, her statements in a Wall Street Journal interview deserve some discussion.
In order of appearance:
As I stressed above, by “we” she does not mean Goldman Sachs, just the Asset & Management Division.
An easy reaction here is to scoff at her limited understanding of digital assets, because obviously theyarean “investment asset class” in that they trade on active markets, and people invest in them. But it turns out that the official definition of the term can vary. ChatGPT’s definition coincides with many others I looked up:
“A group of financial instruments that have similar financial characteristics, are subject to the same laws and regulations, and are typically traded in the same financial markets.”
It could be that Ms. Mossavar-Rahmani was referring to the lack of regulatory standards around crypto assets, at least in the U.S. If that second prong is indeed part of Goldman Sachs’ definition, then crypto assets do not fit. For now, anyway.
Also, “similar financial characteristics” is a bit of a stretch. Stablecoins are very different from BTC, which, in turn, is very different from AVAX, BONK and a long list of others.
We should bear in mind that she could be speaking about the category characteristics and not about whether or not crypto is investable.
This one is easy to take strong exception to, because we all know that you don’t have to have specific values in mind to believe something will go up or down. We also all know that you cannot accurately value crypto assets, for too many reasons to go into here. But there is no shortage of bulls and bears. So, obviously and provably false, right?
Hmm. For now, let’s try and put ourselves in Mossavar-Rahmani’s shoes. She runs an investment advisor division, one that is subject to considerable scrutiny and bureaucracy. She didn’t survive over 31 years at a particularly cutthroat organization by taking hard-to-explain risks with other people’s money. Old-school investment advisors need to be able to justify decisions to their clients, they need to “show their work” in case an investment goes badly. If her team can’t assign a model-based value to BTC, they can’t make buy or sell recommendations.
Most of us don’t have Goldman Sachs-level constraints. For me, “up” is good enough, and I have a ballpark number at which I might take some profits, based on “feelz.” Other investment advisors I’ve spoken to have come up with target levels, but they’re not based on any validated method.
I will allow myself the observation that Goldman Sachs has many very smart investment analysts who surely can come up with a justifiable model. Other big-name firms have done so, and even if there is little agreement, what matters is the reasoning. Leaving that task aside, I think we have a right to expect more from a firm that has styled itself as a pillar of Wall Street. That there is no “official” model seems like lazy thinking.
But, Mossavar-Rahmani’s job is to play it safe. In that context, her comment is not out of line.
Okay, this one is really hard to defend. Crypto assets offer a wide range of services and use cases, which have value. Even if we narrow the discussion to BTC, it clearly has value for those struggling with currency depreciation or limited financial access.
But it turns out that “value” is a very misunderstood word, even among investment professionals. Most of us assume that the concept has to do with utility, appreciation, satisfaction, belonging, and a host of other touchy-feely benefits. Art has “value,” so do flowers and friendships.
But, maybe, Mossavar-Rahmani was referring to the “assigned value” we looked at in the previous section. Maybe she meant that if there is no established model spitting out a number, there is no value?
Nope, I give up. This one is indefensible and demonstrates a lack of understanding which I can only attribute to laziness since no-one is doubting her intelligence – “absolutely” no value?? “In any shape or form”? Sigh. I tried.
In this one, actually, she’s kinda largely right. I would definitely suggest adding a qualifier – “someofthe main decisions end up being,” or “the main decisionson some networks canend up being.” But, on the whole, I agree that “decentralization” is an often misused word.
Then again, “decentralization” is not a binary condition. There are varying degrees. And many networks are gradually working towards greater decentralization, as they promised.
Now we come to what is possibly the most revealing quote from the interview.
Goldman Sachs has a long history of not recommending gold, and one theory is that it is because the investment banking division can’t make money issuing gold, whereas they do make a lot of money helping firms issue stocks and bonds. I’m not sure I buy that, but it is extraordinary to see a large investment manager ignore such a significant asset.
Perhaps it’s because gold also does not spin off any concrete “value”? Gold doesn’t have any cash flow or dividends. And, if it doesn’t have any concrete value, how can advisors be bearish or bullish, right? And does gold actually “create” value, does it make anything, does it spin off a yield? No.
I think this statement reveals much about the others. It highlights Mossavar-Rahmani’s definition of “value”, as something that needs to be created. It could be that, for her, value requires a concrete output.
It also highlights her limited understanding of how crypto assets work. Manydohave concrete output. And pretty much all are possible to hold and store.
I’m tempted to point out this comment also suggests a limited view on gold investment, as few institutional or high-net-worth gold investors actually hold their own bars.
But, stepping back, the point of this exercise was to show that not all crypto critics are wrong about everything, and it’s useful to understand exactly where the barriers to acceptance stand. It’s also useful to acknowledge that conflicting views make a market, and that they don’t actually matter much in the longer term.
Even more important, it’s satisfying to think of all the people we personally know who also rejected crypto concepts at first. Smart, educated people steeped in financial lore, who eventually decided to put in the work to better understand what we see – and they all eventually changed their mind.
Maybe Mossavar-Rahmani will change her mind one day, too. Or maybe not. It doesn’t matter. If our once-skeptical friends can approach our viewpoint with an open mind, then we should try to approach our critics with the same. At the very least, it will help us better understand just where we need to focus our explaining efforts.",66042.55,-0.02,66001.35,-0.08,65794.05,-0.39,65845.45,-0.32,66054.4
8067,2017-11-26 06:58:31,"Oil Price Fundamental Weekly Forecast – Pipeline Shutdown, OPEC Production Cut Extension Key Market Drivers","U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures hit a two-year high last week and international-benchmark Brent crude oil hovered near a multi-year high as investors reacted to the partial closure of the Keystone pipeline connecting Canadian oilfields with the United States. The news was bullish because it contributed to the tightening of U.S. supplies.
January WTI crude oil settled at $58.95, up $2.24 or +3.95% and February Brent crude oil finished the week at $63.47, up $0.92 or +1.47%.
The oil spill that shutdown the Keystone pipeline helped flip prices into backwardation. This is a condition when front-month prices rise above those for future months, indicating an undersupplied market. January WTI crude oil is now trading 4 cents above the February futures contract, a condition not seen in about 3 years.
The Keystone spill on November 16 reduced the usual 590,000 barrel-per-day flow to U.S. refineries, driving down inventories at the main futures storage hub at Cushing, Oklahoma.
In other news, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. crude inventories fell 1.9 million barrels in the week to November 17 to 457.14 million barrels.
U.S. energy companies this week added oil rigs, with the monthly rig count rising for the first time since July. Drillers added nine oil rigs in the week to November 22, bringing the total count up to 747, according to General Electric Co.’s Baker Hughes energy services firm.
This should be an active week for crude oil traders. The key market driving events will be the Keystone Pipeline problem and the OPEC meeting on November 30.
WTI crude oil futures should continue to remain underpinned and prices could continue to rise the longer it takes to bring the Keystone pipeline back on line. Some traders are estimating the pipeline may be out for another two weeks.
On November 30, OPEC meets in Vienna, Austria. It is expected to extend the deal to cut production from March 2018 to December 2018.
According to Bloomberg, OPEC and Russia have outlined the framework for an extension. However, at this time the details remain unclear and the news report says there is no final agreement yet.
The majority of OPEC members are endorsing an extension, however, Russian support is the key risk.
In October, President Vladimir Putin indicated that Russia backed extending the deal to the end of 2018, but comments by officials and in Russian media have created uncertainty since then.
As far as the price action is concerned, the pipeline shutdown is bullish news. The announcement of an extension can cause a volatile two-sided trade because it has already been priced into the market. Anything less than a 9-month extension should be bearish. The absence of Russia from the extension will also be bearish news. If the OPEC-led group decides to extend and expand the production cuts then this news will be extremely bullish.

50360,2022-11-09 18:33:17,Bitcoin Falls to Two-Year Low as Market Reels From FTX Fallout,"The price of Bitcoin is now below $17,000—the first time that the asset has dropped that low since November 2020.
It’s been a volatile week for crypto assets, as the market reacts to the news that one of the biggest exchanges on the planet, FTX, was apparently insolvent. Binance, the world’s biggest digital asset exchange by volume,announced yesterdaythat it had agreed to acquire FTX in what would amount to a bailout for the company founded by Sam Bankman-Fried.
The markets have swung wildly in the hours since. Bitcoin today has traded for nearly $18,000 but is now firmly below the $17,000 mark, according to CoinGecko, currently trading for just $16,700. That’s a 17% dip over the last seven days.
The asset’s price is now 75% lower than its all-time high of $69,044 that it touched in November 2021.
Every other coin and token is in trouble, too. Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is worse off than Bitcoin, having dropped 16% in 24 hours—priced at just above $1,100.
And most other cryptocurrencies are in the red. In the past day, the worst performing are FTX’s native token, FTT, and Solana (SOL), which has now fallen to sixteenth on the list of most valuable cryptocurrencies by market cap. Solana stood in the top five for most of the latter half of 2021 and had remained in the top 10 until earlier this week.
FTT has dropped 62% in 24 hours and is worth $3.44; SOL is currently priced at $14—40% lower than it was 24 hours ago.
Apart from the crypto news, the digital asset market has other macroeconomic issues to factor in: the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer price index (CPI) drops data tomorrow, showing the latest figures on inflation in the American economy.
The last time hot inflation figures were revealed, the price of Bitcoin dipped along with the stock market.
U.S. equities were down at the time of writing as investors make sense of the midterm elections and which party will control Congress next week as results continue to dribble in.

6290,2019-06-13 13:38:47,Bakkt Reveals Bitcoin Futures Contract Details Ahead of July Test Date,"The Intercontinental Exchange’s pending bitcoin platform Bakkt plans to begin testing its two futures contracts on July 22 of this year.
Ina blog postthat likened Bakkt’s launch to the Apollo 11 moon landing, chief operating officer Adam White wrote Thursday that the platform will “initiate user acceptance testing” for its bitcoin futures contracts, which will be listed and traded by its parent company. Bakkt announced last month that it wouldbegin testing in July, though it did not provide a specific date at the time.
In addition to the date, ICE provided new details for Bakkt’smonthly contract, as well as updated the contract specifications for itsdaily contract.
Bakkt Sets July Test Date for Bitcoin Futures
Both contracts will see a minimum price fluctuation of $2.50 per bitcoin (with each contract containing one bitcoin). Trades may be executed at $0.01 per bitcoin, with a listing cycle that can last for as long as 12 months (for the monthly contract) or 70 consecutive eligible contract dates (for the daily contract).
Final settlement for both contracts will be at the Bakkt Warehouse.
Stepping back, ICE announcedlast yearthat it would be launching physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts. Unlike cash-settled contracts, such as what CME Group offers, customers receive an actual bitcoin on the contract’s expiration, and not the fiat equivalent to bitcoin’s price.
On Thursday, White wrote that Bakkt’s mission is “ to support the development of trusted infrastructure for securely transacting in the new market for digital assets.”
Regulators Ready to Approve Ethereum Futures, CFTC Insider Says
The exchange initially announced potential launch dates last year and January of this year, thoughbothweredelayeddue toa lack of regulatory approvals. The delay appears to stem in part from Bakkt’s plan towarehouse its own bitcoinand clear trades through the ICE clearinghouse.
Bakkt has not yet announced a final launch date.
The company first revealed last month it was self-certifying its futures contracts, which included a daily contract that was previously announced and a monthly contract that was not.
“This is no small step,” White wrote Thursday. “This launch will usher in a new standard for accessing crypto markets.”
He added:
“Compared to other markets, institutional participation in crypto remains constrained due to limitations like market infrastructure and regulatory certainty. This results in lower trading volumes, liquidity, and price transparency than more established markets like ICE’s Brent Crude futures contract, which has earned global trust in setting the world’s price of crude oil.”

75724,2022-12-13 23:04:35,5 Cheap Growth Stocks That Are Too Good to Ignore,"The bear market of 2022 has not been kind whatsoever, and it has been especially unkind to growth stocks. These stocks have been hammered this year, with many equities falling by 65% to 80% or more. As a result, investors are looking for cheap growth stocks to buy.
At the same time, that’s a difficult game to play, given the current environment.
In a bear market, cheap growth stocks can always get cheaper. Once these stocks are in a downtrend, virtually nothing can save them. Strong earnings, reasonable valuations and insider buying mean nothing to the Street during bear markets.
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Valuation and insider selling cannot stop these stocks during a roaring bull market, and the opposite trends cannot support stocks in down markets, either.
With those caveats out of the way, let’s look at a few cheap growth stocks to buy.
[{""NFLX"": ""AMD"", ""Netflix"": ""Advanced Micro Devices"", ""$321.70"": ""$71.94""}, {""NFLX"": ""PYPL"", ""Netflix"": ""PayPal"", ""$321.70"": ""$74.23""}, {""NFLX"": ""DOCN"", ""Netflix"": ""DigitalOcean"", ""$321.70"": ""$29.09""}, {""NFLX"": ""CRM"", ""Netflix"": ""Salesforce"", ""$321.70"": ""$135.53""}]

A few months ago, I wrote about whyNetflix(NASDAQ:NFLX) appears to be undervalued.
If anything, Netflix went from growth stock to value stock in just six months. In that span, the shares fell more than 76%, reducing its market capitalization by hundreds of billions of dollars.
It was a stunning fall for the world’s largest streaming video service. However, it created a buying opportunity.
Despite the fall, Netflix has been the best-looking FAANG member from a technical perspective over the last few months. In fact, it has rallied more than 80% off its low.
Admittedly, that has made Netflix stock less cheap, as the shares now trade at roughly 30 times analysts’ average 2022 earnings estimate rather than the sub-20 times valuation that it carried earlier this year.
Still, the company isgrowing its top and bottom line, and it has a reasonable valuation. Keep an eye on Netflix when it dips.

It seems like everyone is forgetting aboutAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ:AMD) but that’s a huge mistake. The company provides building blocks used in many types of growing technologies and is increasingly playing a larger role in critical parts of the tech sector.
Whether it’s in cloud computing, gaming, graphics, machine learning, deep learning or otherwise, AMD’s chips are being widely used.
Like its peers though, the company’s demand is now slipping slightly. At some point, that modest dip will be reflected in the shares after they lost two-thirds of their value. After that decline, AMD is stunningly cheap.
That’s particularly true because analystscontinue to expectAMD to grow going forward. And at its recent low, the shares were changing hands for less than 16 times the company’s earnings.
That’s dirt cheap for a high-quality company like AMD, especially as CEO Lisa Su continues to not just boost its revenue, but nearly all of its financial metrics.

I couldn’t help but take a stab at buyingPayPal(NASDAQ:PYPL) stock in after-hours trading a few weeks ago. I rarely buy or sell stocks in after-hours trading, but the stock was plunging after PYPL reported its earnings on Nov. 3.
The stock was retesting its 52-week low after the report, and I fully expected it to continue falling for a number of additional days. However, I was a buyer for the simple reason that PayPal became one of the cheap growth stocks that were too hard for me to ignore.
The company’s Q3earnings and revenue beatanalysts’ mean outlooks. Interestingly though, PYPL slightly lowered its 2022 revenue guidance whileboostingits earnings outlook. Since the shares were trading at about 16.5 times its 2022 EPS guidance, the stock was too tempting to pass up.
I don’t know when PayPal will get back to sustainable, attractive growth and/or be loved by the Street again. However, I do know that it is too good a company to ignore at this valuation. It’s worth buying in the $70s or even $80s. That’s especially true for investors who plan to hold the shares for multiple years.

I know people will critique this pick because cloud infrastructure companyDigitalOcean(NYSE:DOCN) trades at 38 times this year’s earnings estimates. However, I believe that it’s still a cheap growth stock that’s worth buying.
My reasoning is based on the company’s growth outlook.
It’s hard to find names that are growing rapidly but trade at low or reasonable valuations. So sometimes it’s worthwhile buying the stocks of companies that are growing rapidly, even if their valuation is a bit high.
In the case of DigitalOcean, analysts, on average, expect its revenue to climb 34% this year and 29% next year. On the earnings front, the mean estimate calls for 141% growth this year and a 40% increase next year.
So the shares are trading at just 27 times next year’s mean EPS estimate. (DOCN’s new fiscal year begins in just six weeks).

I had a good feeling that buyers would get a chance to scoop upSalesforce(NYSE:CRM)in the $120s. My confidence about that grew when the shares were trading in the mid-$130s.
But now, with CRM trading above $160, it’s possible that investors may not get a chance to buy the name in the $115 to $125 range.  Sometimes a strategy of waiting and waiting for lower prices doesn’t work out. However, Salesforce should not be ignored.
While analysts’ average estimate calls for the company’s earnings to be flat this year, the meanoutlookcalls for double-digit-percentage revenue growth in each of the next four years. That’s not a surprise, since the companyforecastrevenue of $50 billion for fiscal 2026.
That’s significantly ahead of analysts’ mean sales estimate for this year of $31 billion and was about $5 billion more than analysts, on average, were expecting for FY26.
Even at Salesforce’s current prices, its valuation isn’t that obnoxious. In the past,  CRM was viewed as one of the most overvalued stocks in the market. That was a huge mistake, as the shares have exploded higher over the last decade.
Despite CRM’s recent rally, the shares trade at “just” 33 times the company’s earnings.

64728,2021-02-07 11:00:47,Reddit Investors Who Played GameStop Are Now Upvoting Silver,"This article was originally published onETFTrends.com.
Those of you with kids and grandkids may at some point have stepped inside a GameStop. If so, you might be familiar with the video game retailer’s tagline: “Power to the players.”
The same slogan could just as easily be the rallying cry for the millions of millennial and Gen Z Reddit-users who took to Robinhood last week to drive up the share price of the beloved yet struggling GameStop.
(Fun fact: Ross Perot was one of the earliest seed investors in GameStop’s predecessor, Babbage’s, which first opened its doors in Dallas, Texas, in 1984.)
By now you’ve likely heard the full story. But just in case: A number of hedge funds, including Melvin Capital and Maplelane Capital, took out short positions in GameStop, whose sales were lagging even before the pandemic killed foot traffic. In response, anti-Wall Street organizers on Reddit urged readers to buy GameStop options en masse to catapult its shares “to the moon.” This in turn forced Melvin and others to buy GameStop shares at much higher prices to cover their positions, leading to multibillion-dollar losses. According to reporting by the Wall Street Journal, Melvinlost more than half on its investments in January.
GameStop, meanwhile, surged from around $19 a share to $325—a more-than 1,600% increase. The stock traded a head-spinning $100 billion worth of shares last week, more than Apple and Amazon,according to Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas.
To traders who genuinely care about the company’s survival, I would suggest they consider supporting it by spending their money there this weekend.
The Reddit-fueled rally has drastically impacted price discovery in not just GameStop but other underdog stocks as well. Shares of movie theater operator AMC Entertainment, home goods retailer Bed Bath & Beyond, BlackBerry and Tootsie Roll Industries have also popped. Even Blockbuster’s liquidation holding company saw surreal levels of trading, its daily volume jumping from zero just a month ago to nearly 24 million shares on Thursday.
Today, the price of silver also surged on the back of Reddit forums, touching an eight-year high of $30 an ounce in intraday trading.
Gil Scott-Heron, considered by many to be the first rap artist, informed us back in 1971 that “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.”
That may be so, but it will be tweeted, shared on Instagram, upvoted on Reddit and traded on commission-free Robinhood using decentralized Bitcoin and Ethereum. “Power to the players” indeed.
No matter where your opinion falls in all of this, you can’t deny that it’s historic. To my knowledge, nothing like this has ever happened before in capital markets, where millions of small traders, many of them using their $600 stimulus checks, worked in tandem to cripple wealthy institutional investors, leveraging their very own trading strategies against them.
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), in fact, hasreportedly acquired the film rightsto an as-yet unpublished book about the Reddit-GameStop saga. The book’s working title?The Antisocial Network.
In the process, a number of GameStop traders have made life-changing amounts of money.
Let me be very clear: I’m in favor of Robinhood’s mission to democratize capital markets and finance, but like democracy itself, things can sometimes get messy. What the Redditors are doing is not investing. This isn’t the same asRobinhooders buying airline stocks last Mayafter Warren Buffett dumped his positions in the big four carriers.
It isn’t even speculation. It’s activism—think of it as a type of anti-Wall Street “Arab Spring”—and I fear that some young people may get hurt when the bottom falls out.
Robinhood clearly felt the same when it halted trading in some of the heavily shorted stocks (and, on Friday, as many as 50 other stocks). The online broker, whose tagline is “Investing for Everyone,” tried to clarify its decision in an email last week, saying the temporary restriction “was not made on the direction of any market maker we route to or other market participants.”
Robinhood also emphasized its longstanding mission to open the capital markets up to a greater share of people, including younger and nontraditional investors:
That brings me to Bitcoin, Ethereum and the crypto ecosystem in general, which is likewise helping to democratize finance. When you use a card to pay for your Starbucks, there’s a third party standing between you and the transaction. With Bitcoin and Ethereum, payments are peer-to-peer, open and free to move across borders.
For this reason and more, Ray Dalio last week called Bitcoin “one hell of an invention.”
In ablog postdated January 28, the Bridgewater founder wrote that it’s an “amazing accomplishment” that Bitcoin has been “rapidly gaining popularity as both a type of money and a storehold of wealth.” He added that, to him, Bitcoin looks like an attractive long-term option that he could one day put money in.
Dalio’s comment, I believe, underscores the reality that cryptos are rapidly going mainstream—as an investment, as stores of value and as currencies. It’s no longer just speculators who are participating, but well-known, highly respected investors and organizations.
The week before last, in fact, inflows into cryptocurrency funds and productshit a new record of $1.31 billion,according to CoinShares. So far this year, Bitcoin has seen average daily trading volume of $12.3 billion, up significantly from $2.2 billion last year.
Another sign that Bitcoin is growing in popularity: The number of Bitcoin wallets that contained a positive balance reached a new record high in 2020, according toCoinbase’s 2020 in Review.An estimated 33.2 million wallets held Bitcoin, an increase of 16.8% from the previous year.
Decentralized finance (DeFi) also continued to grow in 2020. In short, DeFi has the potential to completely upend the traditional financial services industry by providing “global, programmatic, decentralized, 24/7/365 markets” for services as various as taking out loans, investing in derivatives, trading assets and buying insurance contracts. For the first time, financial product development has been put “directly in the hands of engineers, who no longer need to work at a bank and ‘ask permission’ to create products.”
According to Coinbase, there were 1.2 million DeFi users around the world taking advantage of these open-source systems. The number will only continue to grow.
I think one of the biggest signs that open-source technology is giving traditional finance a run for its money is that, today, a single Bitcoin is enough to purchase between 100 and 150 shareseachof the big four U.S. banks. Compare that to five years ago, when one coin could only buy you about one share each.
Having said all that, I couldn’t be prouder to have helped bringHIVE Blockchain Technologiesto market more than three years ago. It remains the only crypto miner that mines both Bitcoin and Ethereum.
Today, I’m pleased to say that HIVE ranked number four on the2021 OTCQX Best 50,a ranking of top performing companies on the OTCQX Best Market based on 2020 total return and average daily dollar volume growth.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission has approved 11 Bitcoin-spot exchange-traded funds in a major advance for crypto adoption.
The move allows retail investors access to cryptocurrencies without having to hold them directly.
A number of firms on the approved list say they plan to launch the ETFs as soon as tomorrow.
Rajeev Bamra, SVP, Digital Finance, Moody’s Investors Service, said: ""The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs by the SEC has the potential to simplify and secure Bitcoin investments for a broader investor base, which may reshape the dynamics of cryptocurrency investments.
""It could lead to substantial inflows from institutions interested in entering the cryptocurrency market as it may provide a reliable and transparent price discovery mechanism. This could result in a more stable and liquid crypto market, representing a positive development for the digital finance ecosystem.""
But Brett Hillis, Partner at Reed Smith, said: ""The US is late to this party: European investors have been able to access products providing similar exposure for several years.
""However, in the UK, these products are subject to legacy restrictions that mean they cannot be offered to retail investors.
""The SEC’s move may help to provide financial regulators in Europe and elsewhere the basis to broaden access to these products to retail investors.”

The average 5-year fixed rate mortgage fell to 4.68% by the end of December, according to the latest data published by the Bank of England, drop of 0.2 percentage points compared to the previous month.
That rate looks set for an even steeper fall by the end of January, afterseveral high street banks began offering sub-4% deals earlier this week.
5-year mortgages peaked at a rate of 5.71% in July.

BrewDog is cutting hourly pay rates for its new London hires despite upping them in the rest of the UK.
In a letter to staff, BrewDog Bars CEO James Brown said all new workers would now be paid £11.44 per hour nationwidezhe national living wage. That represents a cut of more than 4% compared to existing London staff, who are paid £11.95 per hour.
Bar staff outside London would see their pay go up by around 5% -- while existing London staff would have their hourly pay frozen, a real-terms cut.
Almost all national employers pay a premium to London-based staff, to make up for higher-than-average living costs. London rent costs are more than double the UK average.

Andrew Bailey says Bitcoin is 'not taking off' as a financial service.
He said: “It’s not taking off as a core financial service. For example, using bitcoin as a payment service is pretty inefficient.”
“So I don’t think the integration into the financial system has kept up the momentum.
“But we have to keep a very close eye on it.”

Asked why the UK's top banks made record profits in the last year, Andrew Bailey said a major reason was that savings rates have not risen as quickly as the Bank Rate.
He said: ""I think it’s a number of things. We have much more benign credit conditions than previously anticipated. Banks were provisioning for much larger Covid losses, and conditions turned out to be better. Banks are now adjusting to that.
""We’d obviously gone through a period where our interest rate was near zero. And the banks would typically set their deposit rates just below ours. But when our rates went to zero, banks wuld typically put their rates just above ours. With our interest rates rising, banks put them back below our rates, which led to some widening of margins.""

The Bank of England’s deputy Governor for fiscal stability Sarah Breeden says Chinese property risks are ‘crystalising’, but that this hasn’t hit UK banks yet.
“It’s clear that vulnerabilities in the Chinese property market are crystalising, and have been since mid-2021.
“What we’ve been focused on from a financial stability market is whether that will spread to the Chinese economy as a whole, or to the Hong Kong property market, where some of our banks are more exposed.
“We haven’t seen that happen yet.”

Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said transport and utilities firms might be more affected by higher interest rates.
When asked about whether companies that are highly levered, and therefore more at risk from higher interest rates, were clustered in certain sectors, he noted there were a few where this was the case.
“If you look at this country in leveraged lending, there’s transport, utilities… water companies,” he said.

Marks Electrical has seen its shares plunge after warning over profits as it suffered during the festive season amid a competitive market and as shoppers remained “highly price-conscious”.
Founder and chief executive Mark Smithson said he is “personally frustrated” that, despite record peak trading, the firm was unable to boost its profit margins as prices came under pressure.
Shares in the group plunged by more than 27% in Wednesday trading as it said the hit is now expected to see annual underlying earnings fall to between £5 million and £6 million.
This would mark a steep drop from the £7.5 million underlying earnings it notched up in 2022.

OK, it’s early days, but so far this year the number of companies saying they will not list their shares in London outnumbers those that will.
Irish unicorn Workhuman has apparently ruled out London after a bitter row with its private equity shareholder Intermediate Capital Group.
Meanwhile the board of travel giant Tui has recommended delisting its shares from the London stock exchange. So that’s two. At the time of writing I am not aware of any IPOs in London being announced since the start of 2024. That is a sobering statistic — it could well be a dry January for the London IPO market.
Things should get better as the year unfolds. But when? In an interview with Bloomberg this morning Erin Platts, the boss of the lender formerly known as Silicon Valley Bank UK — now HSBC Innovation Banking — said she did not see any imminent resurgence, in the tech sector at least. She thought things will start to get better in the fourth quarter, but will not be really motoring until 2025. That feels a long time for the market and its eco-system of advisers and enablers to wait.
She said there were “good conversations” going on about improving the culture and reducing red tape to make London listings more attractive, but “we are not there yet”.
There are multiple talking shops examining the new listings drought that will presumably all come up with recommendations: hopefully not contradicting each other, but who can say.
The response from the Stock Exchange and the City of London Corporation has been, and I paraphrase, “Nothing to see here. The London stock market has been going for 300 years, this is a blip and listings will return.”
Let’s hope so. Platts sees it a bit differently, pointing to a trend that goes back two decades, not 12 months. On the surface the City seems in reasonably good health, but the IPO market is both a global shop window and a litmus paper test of its appeal compared with rival centres. For now at least that is badly lacking.

Housebuilder Persimmon today hailed green shoots in the market as easing mortgage rates boost sales after a “challenging” 2023.
The company said forward sales are 11% ahead of last year though market conditions “remain highly uncertain...particularly for first time buyers”.
The average selling price in the forward order book is £266,100 compared with £255,750 last year.
However, a trading update also underscored how hard the company was hit last year by the impact of soaring mortgage rates and the withdrawal of the Government’s Help to Buy scheme.
Persimmon completed 9,922 new homes in 2023, down a third on the previous year, but slightly better than guidance after a stronger then expected fourth quarter. Chief executive Dean Finch said Persimmon “performed well in challenging market conditions”.
Andy Murphy, director of financials & industrials at investor relations firm Edison Group, said the trading statement showed Persimmon’s “resilience”: “The previous forecast of 9,500 new home completions were surpassed, the average selling price was up by 3% to £255,750 and current forward sales was up 2% to £1.1 billion.”

Japan's stock market continues to outperform after the Nikkei 225 today passed the 34,000 threshold for the first time since January 1990.
It rose another 2% as the yen weakened on bets the country’s ultra-loose monetary policy is unlikely to change in the near term.
The performance also reflects AI-led momentum, with technology companies behind today’s latest strong session.
Shares in heavyweights Sony and Nintendo also rose 4%, but the mood elsewhere was more subdued as Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index closed 0.6% lower and the FTSE 100 index fell 12.23 points to 7671.73.
The lacklustre showing followed Wall Street’s jitters ahead of tomorrow’s December inflation reading and a flurry of banking sector results the next day.
In London’s top flight, Marks & Spencer and Tesco declined 1% on the eve of their trading updates while B&M European Value Retail retreated 6.2p to 560.8p after yesterday’s quarterly sales growth figure missed City hopes.
The FTSE 250 index rose 38.55 points to 19,332.57 after strong sessions for heavyweights Greggs and Persimmon.
Oil services firm Hunting improved 3% to 8.5p to 282.5p after its year-end update delivered on sales and margin targets and showed 12% order book growth in the quarter.
Among small-caps, Costain built on its strong 2023 by announcing a contract with Northumbrian Water to deliver its infrastructure upgrade programme. Costain jumped 7% or 4.7p to 67.3p as it also revealed forecast-beating levels of cash generation.
Vimto drinks firm Nichols is another stock on the front foot but guidance pointing to annual profits slightly ahead of hopes left shares 5p cheaper at 1125p.
Elsewhere on AIM, shares in online household goods retailer Marks Electrical tumbled 26% or 23.5p to 68p after it revealed significant margin pressure.
Quarterly revenues rose 17.8% to £35.1 million as the company increased market share, but with customers still highly price conscious it has warned of a material blow to full year profit guidance.
Fellow electrical retailers AO World and Currys fell 2.75p to 88.5p and 0.9p to 48.1p respectively in the FTSE 250 index.

The boss of Greggs today prophesied another year of bumper growth after the Newcastle-based baker closed out 2023 with a 20% jump in sales.
“We are nowhere near peak Greggs,” CEO Roisin Currie declared in an interview with the Standard.
“We have significantly more shops to open in the UK. Geographically it’s about getting to locations we don’t cover. We’re very focused on the UK – however we should always look beyond the UK to see what the opportunities are.”
Greggs said it will open up to 160 new sites in 2024, adding to the 145 net openings last year to bring its total store count to as high as 2,900.
Total sales climbed just shy of 20% to top £1.8 billion for the year, helped along by a fresh partnership with delivery firm Uber Eats which is now operational in more than one quarter of its estate.
Currie added that inflationary pressure had fallen considerably and that there were no planned price rises ahead.
Greggs shares leapt 7.5% to 2,660p, which remains below its 2023 peak of 2,904p.

That has helpedaverage membership numbers grow 8% to 872,000 in 2023 while total sales grew18% to top £200 million for the first time. But final membership numbers fell backto 850,000 at year-end.
Gym Group’s net debt shrunk from £76 million to £66 millionas the company said revenue growth had offset utility-driven cost inflation andleverage is expected to remain within the range of 1.5 to 2.0x.
CEO Will Orr told the Standard: “We continue to see gooduptake of our memberships at both ends of the spectrum.
“I think there’s a lot of growth to come in the future, thefundamentals are fantastic as well as the appetite from consumers who are gettingmore well-informed about health and fitness.”

London cocktail bar operator Nightcap saw revenue rocket to a record £7.4 million in December, its best ever month.
The strong month for the owner of Blame Gloria and The Cocktail Club meant revenue for the six months to 31 December also surged, by 40% to £32.7 million.
The group was boosted by the addition of Dirty Martini, which it bought out of administration in June.
Boss Sarah Willingham said: “I could not be prouder of the entire Nightcap team as we continue to build the UK's leading premium bar group.
""2023 has been a volatile year, particularly in terms of the macro-economic impact on the hospitality sector.”
She said she expected growth in 2024 as lower inflation and interest cuts boost the disposable income of Nightcap customers.
Shares rocketed by 19% to 6.1p today, after tumbling in the last four months of 2023. They’re still down more than 80% from their peak in 2021.

Shares in Sainsbury’s have given up recent gains, dipping 4% or 12.7p to 293.2p after the retailer’s Christmas update highlighted sales pressure at Argos.
Tesco also retreated 5.9p to 294.6p ahead of its own update tomorrow, with the pair the leading fallers in another downbeat session for the FTSE 100 index.
London’s top flight lost 13.90 points to 7670.06 in a session when Marks & Spencer and BT Group also fell by around 1% and AstraZeneca dipped 66p to 10,836p.
The FTSE 250 index edged up 24.44 points to 19,318.46, assisted by Persimmon after the housebuilder rose 3% or 42p to 1433.5p following its end-of-year trading update.

New home completions tumbled by 33% at Persimmon in 2023, but the housebuilder sees signs of improvement in 2024.
Completions fell to 9,922, though average selling prices remained steady at £255,750.
Dean Finch, Group Chief Executive, said: ""Persimmon performed well in challenging market conditions, delivering completions ahead of expectations in 2023 alongside enhanced quality metrics of our already five-star homes. Persimmon's offering is resonating well with customers with sales rates relatively robust throughout the year. We have successfully balanced our need to control costs, whilst investing in the business to position it for sustainable growth when conditions improve.
""I would like to thank our colleagues, sub-contractors and suppliers for their commitment and support. Their hard work has helped ensure that Persimmon remains well positioned to serve customers across the UK who seek high quality, sustainable homes at a price they can afford.""
Looking ahead, the firm said private sales are up so far this year when compared to 2023 but “market conditions will remain highly uncertain during 2024”.
“However, mortgage rates are beginning to ease, and the response to our recent Boxing Day campaign has been positive, generating a substantial number of leads for our sales teams. Encouragingly, build costs continue to moderate which will benefit completions in 2024,” it added.

Greggs has rolled into 2024 with another year of growth as the baker plans to open up to 160 new stores by the end of December.

Total sales for 2023 stood at £1.8 billion, an increase of 19.6% compared with 2022. Like-for-like sales in company-managed shops were 13.7% higher than those seen in 2022.
The firm also welcomed that ""inflationary pressures are reducing and with good forward cover on food, packaging and energy we anticipate a more stable cost base in the coming year.""

FTSE 250 utilities firm Pennon Group has bought SES Water, which serves parts of London as well as nearby counties, from its parent company Sumisho Osaka Gas Water as it promised to improve the supplier’s ‘financial resilience’.
SES supplies water to 750,000 people in London, Surrey, West Sussex and Kent.
The purchase price is £89 million, but this implies an enterprise value of £380 million after accounting for SES’s debts.
Pennon said the deal has already been completed, but must still be approved by the CMA with Ofwat input.
Pennon boss Susan Davy said: ""SES Water is a fantastic fit for Pennon as we further expand our presence in water supply across Southern England, building on our successful similar acquisitions of Bournemouth Water and Bristol Water alongside the adoption of water supply in the Isles of Scilly.
“The business is a proven, high-quality water operation. We are particularly impressed by the innovation and technology-led solutions implemented by SES Water.
“As part of the Pennon Group, we will enhance SES Water's financial resilience and better position the business to serve its customers and all stakeholders, as has proven to be the case with our acquisitions of Bournemouth Water and Bristol Water.”
The deal comes at a time of turmoil for the water sector, which has faced criticism for the amounts of sewage that has leaked into rivers.

Sainsbury’s sold a record number of pigs in blankets, mince pies and sparkling wine over Christmas as it today reported a strong festive period that lays down a challenge to rivals.
It is holding profit guidance for the full year to March at between £670 million to £700 million, at which point the three-year plan from CEO Simon Roberts will be at an end and a new strategy will be unveiled.
Since Sainsbury claims to be taking market share from all the other large grocers, investors are likely to want to keep Roberts despite some rumblings about his pay of towards £5 million last year.
Sainsbury, which is one of the biggest private sector employers with 152,000 staff, has just put £200 million into the staff pay pot to ensure all get the real living wage.
Sales rose 9.3% in the third quarter and 8.6% over the Christmas period. That dip was down to falling inflation not lower volumes of sales, it insists.
It has a price promise on 550 essential products with Aldi, not quite a complete at Asda’s pledge to price match with both Aldi and Lidl.
The grocer says its Nectar card saved customers £16 on an average £80 shop over Christmas.
The share open today at 307p – they are up 25% in the past year.

37848,2019-05-10 11:00:36,"A Multi-Factor ETF Idea to Tap Low Volatility, Quality, Value","This article was originally published onETFTrends.com.
The current market environment could be appropriate for theSPDR MSCI Quality Mix USA ETF (QUS) , an exchange traded fund with exposure to the low volatility, quality and value investment factors.
QUS tracks the equally-weighted MSCI USA Quality Mix A-Series Index, which is a combination of the MSCI USA Value Weighted, MSCI USA Minimum Volatility and MSCI USA Quality Indexes.
The quality factor is a point of emphasis for a growing number ofstrategic beta exchange traded funds. Though there has been debate surrounding defining quality as it pertains to factor-based investing, quality companies and dividend-paying stocks often go hand-in-hand because those dividends are seen as signs of stable earnings and thoughtful management.
“From a smart beta factor perspective, quality has led all year and is the best-performing factor over the past three and 12 months,” said State Streetin a recent note. “This trend reinforces the late-cycle narrative, where investors are placing a higher emphasis on balance sheet sustainability and cash flow generation—two traits inherent within the quality factor.”
Right Time For A QUS Query
Among factor-based strategies, low or minimum volatility and quality are again proving popular with advisors and investors in 2019.
The low-volatility factor investments work on the idea that they help cushion against market turns, limiting drawdowns that investors experience while providing upside potential. Consequently, the low- or min-vol strategies may produce better risk-adjusted returns over the long haul, which has been backed by extensive academic research.
“Diving a bit deeper to see the interplay between factors, the higher preference for caution is reinforced,” said State Street. “Low beta, defensive, and growth exposures—where half of the stocks in the Russell 1000 Growth Index can be found within the quality factor index from MSCI, have outweighed the more cyclical components of the market. Even with morecyclicalpositioning as of late, high beta, dynamic, and small caps are all still underperforming on a one-year basis.”
Home to nearly $265 million in assets, QUS holds 620 stocks. QUS allocates 24.41% of its weight to technology stocks and nearly a quarter of its combined weight to the financial services and healthcare sectors.
“Growth is coming at a high price, given that growth stocks trade in the top decile relative to their 15-year history, based on price-to-earnings,” according to State Street. “Consider targeting inexpensive firms with sustainable cash flows and quality balance sheets to combat higher valuations while still positioning for growth.”

20813,2019-03-18 09:00:38,Coinbase Pro increases fees in market structure update,"US-based crypto exchange Coinbase is “implementing a set of changes to further optimise the market health of our platform,” it announced in a Medium post . The aim is to increase liquidity, enable better price discovery for trades, and to make price movements smoother, with changes including a new fee structure, turning off stop market order and adding market order protection points. XLM Earlier this week, we reported that Stellar Lumens (XLM) had officially been listed on Coinbase Pro. XLM, which is the seventh-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap, will not yet be available on the Coinbase retail platforms including Coinbase.com and the mobile apps. Stellar was launched in 2014 by Ripple Co-Founder Jed McCaleb, with all XLM tokens being premined. Coinbase claims that: “Stellar aims to connect banks, payment systems, and individuals quickly and reliably. Since its launch in 2014, its vision has been to unite the world’s financial infrastructure so that money can flow quickly and cheaply between banks, businesses, and people. The internet connected the world’s computers so that information could be shared globally. Stellar aims to do the same for money.” Despite being cautious in 2017 by only listing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, Coinbase has been exercising a gung-ho attitude of late, with the likes of Loom Network, MANA, XRP, Dai, Golem Network, and Zilliqa all finding their way onto the exchange. This change in approach could suggest that regulatory pressure is waning, which would tie in with SEC chief Jay Clayton’s recent statement confirming that Ethereum “is not a security.” The post Coinbase Pro increases fees in market structure update appeared first on Coin Rivet .",3988.83,-0.0,3989.16,0.0,3978.2,-0.27,3974.27,-0.37,3988.99

See related article: XRP triumphs over SEC, but crypto clarity remains in the shadows Fast Facts: The SEC will no longer pursue claims that Ripple’s Garlinghouse and Larsen aided the company in violating securities laws related to its XRP transactions. According to Thursday’s filing , the parties agreed to voluntarily dismiss the aiding and abetting charges with prejudice, meaning that the charges can’t be filed again. The filing added that the SEC will continue pursuing its claims against Ripple. In July, Judge Torres ruled Ripple Labs’ programmatic sales of the XRP token to retail investors did not qualify as financial securities.

35297,2018-06-11 13:47:44,"Want a Bigger Retirement Nest Egg? Get $24,000 More With 1 Simple Move","When it comes tosaving for retirement, procrastination is the enemy. One of the most popular benefits of using IRAs for retirement savings is that you're allowed to make contributions at the last minute before filing your tax return and still receive a tax deduction. As a result, many people end up waiting until April of the following year before adding to their retirement accounts.
Unfortunately, that delay can be costly. Because of the special benefits that IRAs provide as well as the power of compounding, the longer you wait to get money into your retirement account, the less you'll have. Conversely, those who make just a single easy move can reap big rewards.
Image source: Getty Images.
You can read a lot at The Motley Fool about how along-term investing mentalitycan make such a huge difference in your portfolio's results. The power of compounding can turn even modest amounts of money into immense wealth. Over time, the longer you can wait, the more your money can grow. That makes it essential to put time on your side as quickly and often as possible.
In the moment, it's easy to think that putting off an IRA contribution for a few months won't make a massive difference. But the impact can be a lot bigger than you'd think.
As an example, say that you make $48,000 a year and decide to set aside 10% of your salary in an IRA. Being a procrastinator, you wait to make your annual $4,800 contributions until April of the following year, just in time to get a tax break. Over the next 25 years, you successfully earn an average of 8% each year on your portfolio investments.
Using this strategy, you'd have about $369,000. Your contributions would add up to $120,000, and you'd essentially have tripled your money through investment returns.
Now let's see what happens if you make one simple change in the way you think about retirement savings. Instead of waiting until April of the following year to make your IRA contributions, say that you put that $4,800 to workright away each Januaryas soon as you're allowed to make contributions for the given year. When you run the numbers there, you'll get almost $408,000 after 25 years -- $39,000 more, even though you make exactly the same amount of contributions to your account. All it took was giving your contributions that extra 15 months every year to work for you -- putting time on your side to boost your returns.
Admittedly, not everyone can come up with a $4,800 payment right at the beginning of the year. But there are more realistic alternatives that will still lead to a significantly bigger nest egg.
One of the most painless ways to save for retirement is just todo it automatically through regular withdrawalsfrom your paycheck or bank account. Taking the same amount month in and month out will get you used to the idea of putting money toward saving as a priority, and eventually, you won't even miss the money going into an IRA.
To see how it works, take the example above and change it slightly. Rather than doing a $4,800 annual contribution all at once, say instead that you contribute $400 each month. When you run the numbers, you'll get a final nest egg of about $393,000 -- $24,000 more than you'd get if you waited until the last minute.
The sooner you start putting money aside for retirement, the better off you'll be. IRAs are a great way to save, and the best way to make maximum use of IRAs is to make contributions as soon as you can. The difference could be a lot bigger than you'd ever imagine.

The fund is a Hong Kong corporation that has been set up to legally accept and disperse funds and would be provided funding for six months to support Bitcoin Cash infrastructure. The plan is to implement this proposal into Bitcoin Cash's May 2020 protocol upgrade. The fund would receive approximately 112.5 BCH per day and about 20,588 BCH over the six months. Based on the current prices of BCH, the fund would receive roughly $7.1 million in total.
The proposal has garnered support from other large mining pools part of Bitcoin Cash, which includes Antpool,BTC.com, ViaBTC, andBitcoin.com. These five pools represent 34.5% or a little more than a third of Bitcoin Cash’s hash rate.
The blog states that this proposal may be controversial, and some in the community may have reservations toward it; however, the plan would move forward regardless. “To ensure participation and include subsidization from the whole pool of SHA-256 mining, miners will orphan BCH blocks that do not follow the plan.

DeCurret, which joins anofferingfrom e-commerce giant Rakuten in launching on the domestic market, will begin trading on April 16.
Together with Rakuten Wallet, previously known as Everybody’s Bitcoin, next month will mark the debut of new-to-market Japanese exchanges approved under newlicensing laws.
“With the concept of ‘connecting and exchanging all values and making transactions simple,’ DeCurret aims to become ‘a major financial servicer for digital currency’ that sets standard [sic] for secured and convenient digital currency transaction,” DeCurret summarized in the press release.
The news coincides with statistics shared with cryptocurrency-focused news and data resourceBitcoin.comby Japan’s financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), which show the true extent of interest in the expanding market.
According to the data, over 140 entities have approached the FSA regarding approval of an exchange since March 2018. Of those, 23 have submitted documentation to initiate the process, which is actively underway with a total of seven applicants.
Rakuten and DeCurret represent the only two to have gained formal registration and approval from regulators to launch.
As Cointelegraphreported, the coming year should see that number increase significantly. Among those eyeing a piece of the industry is Yahoo! Japan, which earlier this week said it hoped to launch its part-owned exchange in May.

After the recent spike beyond $9,000 and dramatic fall back to Earth, the market clearly is doing its best to go higher.

“This BTC action looks aggressive. Makes me think that we may blow through 10k and test $12k very soon; but $12k is a very heavy resistance level, so I would expect consolidation around the $10k level for some time if $12k is (likely) rejected.”

91147,2024-08-21 13:21:00,Is It Too Late to Buy Carvana Stock?,"The next time you look up ""volatility"" in a dictionary, you might be met by aCarvana(NYSE: CVNA)logo.
I'm kidding, of course, but the car-buying, vending-machine operator really is a paragon of extreme volatility.
The most erratic member of theS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)market index (where Carvana doesn't have a seat) is oil and gas explorerAPA Corporationwith a beta value of 3.26. The next four names on that list of highly unpredictable stocks are casinos and cruise lines. Carvana has them all beat with a 3.43 beta.
That means Carvana's stock tends to move in the same direction as the broader stock market, but each jump or dip is about 3.43 times as large as the S&P 500's. When the market is down, Carvana dips even lower. And when Wall Street is doing fine, Carvana's stock tends to soar.
I'm looking at one of those extreme swings right now. Carvana's shares are exploring fresh, 52-week highs right now, up from a deep dive in the inflation crisis of 2022.
And it is indeed a soaring peak. Going beyond the S&P 500, there are 880 stocks on the American market with market caps larger than $9 billion. Carvana is smoking that entire field with a 518% gain from its annual lows. In second place on that list, you'll findBitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC)buyerMicroStrategy(NASDAQ: MSTR)at a 353% rebound from recent lows.
Carvana makesan extra-risky Bitcoin investmentlook relatively calm. That's either impressive or terrifying, depending on how you feel about making risky investments.
So Carvana is soaring sky-high right now. Is it too late to buy the stock or does this chart have room to run even higher?
As one might expect from an ultravolatile stock like Carvana, the current yearly-price top is nowhere near the stock's all-time highs. That would be $370 per share, recorded in August 2021. Today's price stands 57% below that record reading.
So Carvana's stock has a history of reaching nosebleed valuations when times are good. But does it have enough fuel to get back there again?
The recent gains were hard-won. Carvana's revenue growth didn't just slow down in 2022; it turned negative for several quarters. The company also posted negative free cash flows in every quarter from its 2016 initial public offering (IPO) to the spring of 2023. The cash burn intensified as the stock chart crumbled in 2022. The company made it through that cash crunch by taking on more debt -- in an environment of rising interest rates.
That trial by fire is the reason why Carvana's stock has been so jumpy in recent years.
The company is doing better nowadays. Carvana reported bottom-line profits in three of the last four quarters, and the stalled revenue line is pointing back up again. Wall Street analysts hold overwhelmingly bullish opinions of this stock now, with 10 out of 14 firms calling it a ""buy"" or better.
Now, Carvana's stock used to be a stone-cold bargain trading at 0.03 times sales near the end of 2022. That valuation ratio is up to 2.5 now, far removed from the earlier pricing which tends to be reserved for businesses on the brink of bankruptcy. With solid earnings, refueled sales growth, and robust cash flows, Carvana appears to have exited that risky category.
It should be said that used car prices and vehicle sales volumes are coming down from the record highs they saw in 2021, just a couple of months after Carvana's stock chart turned sour. The used car market is normalizing after a COVID-19-inspired boom. Carvana's management is adjusting to this reconfigured market, which also is leaning away from old-school internal combustion vehicles in favor of electric cars.
It's a lot to take in, and Carvana has mismanaged the market's sea changes before.
Yet, the company looks quite robust nowadays. Carvana is consistently profitable in 2024, with the most glaring asterisk being a large and expensive debt load. Interest expenses soared to $664 million in the last four quarters, up from $176 million for the 2021 fiscal year. Even so, the company is generating enough profits to start paying down that irksome debt balance.
Where does that put Carvana on the spectrum from ""busted comeback"" to ""surefire turnaround?"" Somewhere near the middle, I think -- the company has a lot left to prove.
So Carvana isn't my favorite growth stock to buy today, but I do expect its jumpy stock chart to calm down as the company continues to improve its operations and wrestles down the mountain of debt papers. Any other growth stock trading at 2.5 times sales would be a screaming buy in my book, and maybe Carvana will get there, too. For now, I recommend staying on the sidelines for a while. This turnaround story could still go wrong in many ways.

15423,2019-07-23 08:00:12,Silk Road profiteer arrested on suspicion of laundering drug money,"Silk Road profiteer Hugh Brian Haney was arrested by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in the US last week for allegedly laundering money illicitly obtained through drug trafficking. The announcement was made by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) on its website. Haney, 60, was arrested near Columbus, Ohio on the belief that he had gained proceeds from trafficking narcotics on the controversial dark web site known as the Silk Road. The Silk Road was a marketplace where illegal drugs and illicit goods were sold frequently by the sites vendors and customers. US attorney Geoffrey Berman said: Working side by side with our law enforcement partners, our office has shut down the Silk Road, the secret online marketplace for illegal drugs, hacking services, and a whole host of other criminal activity. As alleged, Hugh Haney used the Silk Road as a means to sell drugs to people all over the world. Then he allegedly laundered his profits  more than $19 million  through cryptocurrency. Todays arrest should be a warning to dealers peddling their drugs on the dark web that they cannot remain anonymous forever, especially when attempting to legitimatise their illicit proceeds. One prominent narcotics vendor on the Silk Road was known as Pharmville. During a judicially-authorised search of Haneys house in 2018, HSI agents found evidence that Haney was a high-ranking member or administrator of Pharmville involved in large-scale narcotics trafficking. In 2017 and 2018, Haney allegedly transferred Bitcoins representing narcotics proceeds he had earned through his control of Pharmville to an account held by a company involved in the exchange of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. In correspondence with this company, the DOJ has said Haney falsely claimed that he obtained the Bitcoins through his own personal mining endeavours and from individuals [he] met online. Story continues The DOJ continued to claim that the Bitcoins were obtained through transfers from the Silk Road. After Haney transferred the Bitcoins into cash  worth more than $19 million  Homeland Security Investigations seized the money from a custodial account at a bank located in the Southern District of New York. Haney is being charged with one count of concealment of money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and one count of engaging in a financial transaction in criminally-derived property, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

""Clearly, today's 75-basis-point increase is an unusually large one, and I do not expect moves of this size to be common,"" said Powell during his afternoon press conference.

66094,2022-05-16 07:50:30,FOREX-Dollar perched at 2-decade high on weak China data,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar consolidated gains near a two-decade peak on Monday as poor Chinese economic data hurt cyclical currencies including the British pound and the Australian dollar lower.
While expectations of a hawkish Federal Reserve have been instrumental in fuelling a dollar rally that has seen a broad index gain nearly 10% so far this year, the latest episode of dollar gains has been driven by extended lockdowns in China.
China's retail and factory activity fell sharply in April as wide COVID-19 lockdowns confined workers and consumers to their homes.. The offshore Chinese yuan held near a September 2020 low of 6.8380 yuan hit last week.
""Increasingly, the risk is that zero-COVID (policy in China) may stay in place even past the party conference in the third quarter and into the winter season,"" Barclays strategists said in a note downgrading its forecasts for the euro and the yuan for the rest of 2022.
""As such, it may lead to persistent mobility restrictions, as Omicron is notoriously difficult to contain.""
The dollar index was at 104.57, having briefly crossed the 105 level on Friday, its highest since December 2002, after six successive weeks of gains.
The euro was at $1.0395 on Monday morning, slightly lower, and only just above the $1.0354 level it hit on Thursday, its lowest since early 2017. Analysts expect the $1.0340 level as a crucial level of support for the euro.
HSBC strategists expect the euro to fall to parity against the dollar in the coming year. ""Much weaker growth and much higher inflation leave the ECB facing one of the toughest policy challenges in G10 (central banks),"" they said.
Moves were sharper in the Australian dollar, which fell 0.68%, which is most exposed to the Chinese economy.
Crypto markets, which trade around the clock, had a quiet weekend after turmoil last week driven by TerraUSD, a so-called stablecoin, broke its dollar peg though it retraced its gains in early trading on Monday
Bitcoin was trading at around $29,500, down more than 5%, having dropped to $25,400 on Thursday, its lowest since December 2020.

19046,2021-09-28 16:59:39,Regulation doesn't pose 'existential threat to crypto': Blockchain Association head,"Regulators around the world have been cracking down on cryptocurrency trading, and exchange operators have been retrenching. Binance said on Monday that users in Singapore won’t be able to trade on its main platform . Chinese crypto exchange Huobi will stop taking new mainland customers . And U.S. Securities and Exchange Chair Gary Gensler said at a conference this week that “people will be hurt” if crypto markets remain unregulated. But crypto insiders say that by its very nature, decentralized finance and crypto will find ways to survive and thrive. “I don’t think there is an existential threat to crypto markets” from regulation, said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, at Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit Plus: Crypto Investing. “Decentralization is incredibly powerful and these networks can exist in many different places. China has attempted to crack down on crypto multiple times now. They may be getting more aggressive on that front, but as long as the internet persists, crypto networks will persist as well.” Concerns over regulation have hit crypto prices as of late. Bitcoin, for example, has fallen to below $42,000 from a high in early September of over $50,000 . Volatility isn’t unusual in crypto markets, and investors are still expressing confidence, with inflows into crypto products and funds continuing for a sixth straight week , according to CoinShares. Even in China, some buyers remained undeterred by recent governmental rhetoric. Nic Carter, co-founder at CoinMetrics and general partner at Castle Island Ventures, has faith that free markets will prevail. “When markets and the state clash, generally speaking the market will win eventually,” he said at Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit Plus. “There are countless examples throughout history of countries trying to ban currency conversion, and they always failed ... It just so happens, cryptocurrency behind virtual, being something that is peer-to-peer by its very nature, something you can take full ownership of on a smartphone, is uniquely resistant to state control.” Carter and Smith acknowledge that more regulation in the U.S. is probably inevitable, even necessary in some cases. Smith, whose role is to engage with policymakers on behalf of crypto and blockchain companies, said it’s not as though the space is entirely unregulated now. “To say this space is the Wild West is simply not true,” she said. “I want to remind people, a lot of entities acting as intermediaries in the crypto space are registered. They have state money transmitter licenses.” Story continues Smith said there’s a disconnect between the SEC and the industry on how securities law is applied to crypto. This was thrown into the spotlight by a series of tweets from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong , who derided what he called “sketchy behavior” by the SEC. Ultimately, Coinbase said it would propose a regulatory framework and try to work with policymakers. “We have a lot of work to do” when it comes to regulation, Smith said.

35189,2018-06-10 21:00:00,Why Micron Is So Excited About Artificial Intelligence,"Memory specialistMicron(NASDAQ: MU)sells both DRAM, a type of computer memory that's used in virtually every kind of computing device, and NAND flash, which is rapidly gaining traction for high-performance data storage applications as it's quicker and more efficient than hard disk drive-based storage.
Micron's business has continued to benefit from what seems like an insatiable amount of demand for both DRAM and NAND in applications such asmobile phonesand data center servers.
Image source: Micron.
One of the sub-segments within data center servers is the market for servers that handle machine learning, commonly referred to as artificial intelligence, processing tasks. That sub-segment is small today, with data center chip giantIntelestimating the market at around 7% of total data center server shipments in 2016, but it's also, according to Intel, the fastest growing.
The companies thatmake the processorsthat perform these machine learning computations are clearly very excited about the artificial intelligence opportunity as it means they'll get tosell a lot more computing power over the years. It's not surprising, then, that Micron, which makes the memory chips those processors will rely on to handle those computations, is also excited by this opportunity.
Let's go over what Micron had to say about its view of the artificial intelligence opportunity at its most recent analyst day .
Micron says that a typical machine learning training workload will require six times the amount of DRAM that a ""standard cloud server"" needs and twice as much solid state drive capacity. Those are pretty huge memory content increases.
In a graphic that Micron included in its analyst day presentation, it conceded that ""AI-capable"" servers made up just a small fraction of overall server shipments in calendar year 2017. However, it expects that percentage to grow substantially by calendar year 2021 and to get close to half of all server shipments by 2025.
It's important to keep in mind that making predictions is hard and the chances that those predictions will be wrong go up the further out they are. While I think investors should believe Micron's general prediction that ""AI-capable"" servers will become more ubiquitous over time, don't put a ton of stock in the predictions about the exact percentage that such servers will make up.
Ultimately, Micron's opportunity within artificial intelligence is just one (albeit increasingly important) part of its overall data center opportunity. According to the company, in calendar year 2017, Micron's total addressable market for data center memory products, which includes DRAM, NAND, and 3D XPoint, was worth around $29 billion. By calendar year 2021, the company estimates that the opportunity will swell to $62 billion.
Micron isn't the only company that sells DRAM and NAND, but if the company's estimates are even close to correct, then a rising tide in this case should raise all boats. If Micron simply keeps its data center memory share flat through 2021, then its revenues from that segment could be poised to more than double.
If Micron is able to gain share -- and given the company's improved technology execution over the years, I think that's certainly possible -- then Micron's data center memory business could significantly outpace the market and more than double in size.
It's hard not to be excited about Micron's opportunity in artificial intelligence and, more importantly, in the data center. In fact, if I were to pick my favorite reason to buy Micron stock, it'd be the company's data center opportunity.

Authorities in Hamilton, Ontario issued abrief statementon July 5 indicating that recent reports of an investigation into two Canadian teens ""did not occur.""
A spoofed email from an alleged representative from the Hamilton Police first contacted news outlets reporting the fake crime.
""Hamilton Police can confirm this investigation did not occur and the email did not originate from the Hamilton Police Service,"" it reads.
The story, first published and now updated byCBC Hamilton, indicated the twoallegedly defrauded a U.S. man of $4.2 million inBitcoinandEthereumin a scam known as a “spear phishing” attack.
It also indicated that the Hamilton Police were engaged in a joint investigation withthe FBI and the United States Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force.
""The Hamilton Police are investigating into the email source that created and sent out this information,"" reads authorities' statement. ""Impersonating a police officer is a criminal offense.""
From Twitter bots to AI-generated CEOs, crypto scammers have been hard at work duping users.
In 2020, authorities arrested Graham Clark of Tampa Florida for executing one of thelargest hacks on Twitterthat Summer. The attack targeted various high-profile accounts, including Joe Biden, Uber's company account, and Kim Kardashian. Each began spewing a common Bitcoin scam in which users thatdonatedcrypto to an address would earn double the amount.
This year NatWest, a large British bank,issueda report revealing how much money its clients had lost to fake celebrity ads that promoted a crypto scheme. A spoofed Jeff Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon, took the cake, luring in one victim to the tune of nearly $200,000.
Artificial intelligenceis also playinga key role in crypto scams. The California Department of Financial Protection & Innovation issued a slew of cease and desist letters to five different companies making false promises to investors.
One firm, Maxpread Technologies, is alleged to have “attempted to trick investors about the identity of the CEO using a fake, AI-generated avatar programmed to recite a script.”",30679.98,0.08,30692.0,0.12,30523.54,-0.43,30443.99,-0.69,30654.0
32578,2018-05-21 16:08:40,Why MB Financial Stock Is Soaring Today,"Shares ofMB Financial, Inc.(NASDAQ: MBFI)are up by roughly 13% as of 11:45 a.m. EDT after the company announced it would be acquired byFifth Third Bancorp(NASDAQ: FITB). Fifth Third shares were down by nearly 8% in active trading today, suggesting that its shareholders aren't as enthusiastic about the acquisition.
MB Financial shareholders are slated to receive $5.54 in cash plus 1.45 shares of Fifth Third for every MB Financial share they own. At recent market prices, that values MB Financial at about $50.26 per share.
Acquiring MB Financial is a way for Fifth Third to grow itsretail bankingpresence in the Chicago market. After the acquisition, the combined company will have total Chicago deposit market share of 6.5% and become the second-largest bank in the area by middle market business relationships.

Fifth Third Bancorp said in a presentation that it sees the opportunity to cut $255 million in annual expenses, or 45% of MB Financial's non-interest expenses. Approximately 70% of MB Financial's branches are within two miles of a Fifth Third branch, which gives the combined company the ability to consolidate and close branches to save on costs.
The market clearly views this deal as being better for MB Financial shareholders than owners of Fifth Third. The acquisition places a high price on MB Financial, valuing it at more than 16 times consensus earnings estimates in 2019, and at nearly 2.8 timestangible book value. In contrast, Fifth Third Bancorp shares traded for about 2 times tangible book value at market close on Friday.
For its part, Fifth Third said that it valued MB Financial at less than 10 times earnings estimates for 2019 based on fully phased-in cost savings. But investors are right to be skeptical, as history suggests that synergies are easy to forecast, but difficult to realize.

3239,2019-05-28 14:11:35,Kik is Crowdfunding $5 Million in Crypto to Help Fight SEC,"Canada-based messaging app firm Kik has launched a crypto crowdfunding campaign to support a likely court battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over its 2017 initial coin offering (ICO).
Announced by Kik founder and CEO Ted Livingston and Patrick Gibbs, a partner at law firm Cooley LLP, on theUnChained PodcastTuesday, the campaign is being launched in the hopes that “a lawsuit would eventually result in a newHowey testfor crypto tokens, to determine which ones are a security.”
A dedicatedwebsite– dubbed Defend Crypto – has already been set up allowing supporters to contribute to the fundraising effort, that its founders say is not only in support of Kik but many crypto firms that face potential action from the U.S. regulator. The site offers donation options in 19 cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and XRP, as well as less standard options like augur (REP), DAI and, of course, Kik’s kin (KIN) token.
Public Perceptions of the Bitcoin Spot Market Are Wrong, Says Bitwise
While Kik maintains that its token is used as a currency, the SEC has expressed concerns that kin might be a security and the regulator mayseek an enforcement actionagainst the firm.
Indeed, SEC chairman Jay Clayton has previouslysaid: “I believe every ICO I’ve seen is a security.” He added: “I want to go back to separating ICOs and cryptocurrencies. ICOs that are securities offerings, we should regulate them like we regulate securities offerings. End of story.”
On the new website, Kik states:
“After months of trying to find a reasonable solution, Kin has been unable to reach a settlement that wouldn’t severely impact the Kin project and everyone in the space. So Kin is going to take on the SEC in court to make sure there is a foundation for innovation going forward.”
SEC Sues Alleged $26 Million ‘Crypto’ Ponzi Scheme Operator
Arguing that the case would set a precedent for how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the U.S., Kik said the Defend Crypto campaign would help ensure the funds are in place “to do this the right way.” The firmclaimsit’s already spent over $5 million on the case and is now committing another $5 million in BTC, ETH, and KIN “to fight this out on behalf of the industry.”
Noted crypto investor Fred Wilson indicated in ablog postthat he’s already donated to the cause, and said: “It is my hope, and Kin’s hope, thatDefendCrypto.orgwill be an inspiration for the many other important crypto projects that are silently battling with the SEC to come public and raise capital from the crypto sector for their fights.”
Kik is encouraging other supporters to fight this “innovation tax” by donating cryptos that will held in a Coinbase account and only be used once Kik’s $5 million has been spent. Unused funds will be allocated to “other initiatives.”
Livingston told CoinDesk earlier this month:
“In the last month alone, over a million people earned kin from 40 different apps, from 40 different companies. Over a quarter million people used kin, making it the most-used cryptocurrency in the world, and they’re not even willing to say that’s not a security.”

The payment as a service via a cloud-based platform covers the entire value chain.The vendors can collaborate with e-commerce entities, banks, financial institutions, fintech, insurance companies, and telecommunication companies for online payment service gateways. These organizations can integrate their services with PaaS platforms through open APIs, depending on the business needs. PaaS offerings provide cost-benefit to customers, accelerate service commercialization, and are scalable with availability.For financial institutions; banks; and other organizations, payment-as-a-service has a multitude of benefits across the entire payment value structure. PaaS has reduced financial institutions’ costs as PaaS providers have their own hardware and software. It has also helped organizations to reduce management costs and optimize technology costs.COVID – 19 Impact AnalysisThe Payment-as-a-service industry has been positively impacted by COVID-19. This is because of the increase in the adoption and utilization of online payment methods among consumers worldwide. As consumers are becoming aware of the payment structure, the payment-as-a-service market has seen massive growth. The rising trend of digital payments during the pandemic has boosted industry growth. A certain degree of shift in consumers from traditional payments to digital payments has been observed ever since COVID-19 started. This is largely because of the worries associated with the transmission of coronavirus through cash transactions.Market Growth FactorsRising adoption of digital paymentsThe rising smartphone penetration and massive use of the internet with technological developments have increased the demand for online payment gateways across various countries. Customers are using online payment channels more often as banks and financial institutions offer real-time payment services. This immediate payment mechanism allows customers to use varied features of online bill payments. These services have resulted in a change in consumer behavior patterns from cash payments to online payments with easy access to the internet.Increasing e-commerce transactionsE-commerce business over the last few years has grown significantly owing to the rising number of smartphone users, and the increasing internet penetration. E-commerce provides an online platform for goods & services to consumers from businesses directly. Consumers are progressively shifting towards online purchases for a number of goods and services like groceries, health, beauty, apparel, accessories, computer & electronics, and books. E-commerce platforms provide individuals with ease of ordering and receiving at one’s doorstep.Market Restraining FactorsSecurity issues while making digital transactionsOnline payment gateways are prone to severe external threats despite rigorous measures like symmetric encryption to make online payments secure. Scammers are ascribing to phishing attacks to steal the personal and financial information of people through their e-wallets. Moreover, online payments are also weakened by insufficient authentications. Other people can also use e-wallets, and cards of other people if unique identification measures like biometric or facial recognition are not adopted.Component OutlookBased on component, the payment as a service market is divided into platform and services. The service segment covered a substantial growth rate in the payment as a service market in 2021. The main reason behind the service segment’s growth is the ability to enhance the customer experience and fulfilling the additional demands of the customers. These services become very important because they are directly associated with customer relationship engagement. Further, all pre and post-deployment solutions are managed with the help of these services.Service OutlookOn the basis of service type, the payment as a service market is fragmented into managed and professional. In 2021, the professional segment registered the largest revenue share in the payment as a service market. The major factor for the rise in the growth of the segment is the acceptance of professional services worldwide to provide API-based services for digital payments. The use of professional services also assists businesses to comply with multiple tax requirements, self-service accounts, tracking financial performance, and easy online payments.Industry OutlookBy industry, the payment as a service market is segmented into retail & e-commerce, healthcare, travel & hospitality, BFSI and others. In 2021, the retail & e-commerce segment witnessed the highest revenue share in the payment as a service market. The flourishing online shopping platforms through e-commerce along with exceptional internet connectivity have driven the growth of the sector. Payment as a service has facilitated online vendors, and retailers to receive payments from consumers using numerous methods like internet banking, credit/debit cards, and digital wallets.Regional OutlookRegion wise, the payment as a service market is analyzed across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and LAMEA. In 2021, the Asia-Pacific region recorded the highest revenue share in the payment as a service market. The governments’ encouraging digitization and promoting the use of online payment technologies has imputed the growth of the payment as a service in the region. The Asia-Pacific is witnessing huge investments in the e-commerce industry which rises the usage of digital payment apps. With this rising digital savvy consumers paying digitally for goods and services, the payment as a service market would expand in Asia-Pacific.The major strategies followed by the market participants are Partnerships.

35371,2021-04-02 16:21:59,How Cryptocurrencies.AI Combines Is Creating The Ultimate Trading Platform,"Both centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have distinct benefits and drawbacks, but with the introduction of Cryptocurrencies.AI, users no longer have to settle for one over the other. With the 'AI' standing for Actionable Insight,Cryptocurrencies.AIhas created a highly advanced hybrid platform that makes trading easy for users at any level. It combines the best features of CEXs and DEXs while working to eliminate bottlenecks, crafting an overall better trading experience. The Best of Both Worlds
No matter what your needs are as a trader or investor, Cryptocurrencies.AI aims to cover them. From the centralized side, they offer spot andfutures tradingacross various assets, smart trading, trading view alert integrations, and easy to comprehend trading performance analysis. One of the most important aspects of a successful exchange is a robust selection of tradable assets; Cryptocurrencies.AI offers dozens of individual trading pairs, with many assets paired with US-pegged tokens for added convenience.
With Cryptocurrencies.AI’ssmart trading features, users can test out highly technical models and trading patterns through advanced order types and different levels of automation. This includes the option to create multiple differing buy and sell orders, implement stop-loss orders to protect against downside risk, and take profits with advanced trading options, all with a single transaction. When you add trading performance analysis into the mix, enabling users to meticulously comb over analyzed trading data and further develop their strategies, the Cryptocurrencies.AI CEX has a lot to offer.
A Lightning-Fast DEX
In a world of many DEXs, the vast majority suffer from network congestion and high fees due to Ethereum scalability issues. For Cryptocurencies.AI, building their DEX on Solana eliminated high fees and created what is essentially one of the fastest, if not the fastest, DEX on the market. This was critical to the company as they sought out to create the best DeFi experience for users.
Cryptocurrencies.AI’s DEX also comes with a rich set of features, making trading without the oversight of a third-party easier and safer than ever. Like the CEX, Cryptocurrencies.AI's DEX has a wide range of available trading pairs listed. The DEX does not offer futures trading, only spot trading, but as noted above, the centralized exchange hosts futures if that’s what you’re seeking. They also offerin-depth analytics; when you go to the DEX and click on the 'Analytics' button, you are presented with a plethora of graphs, charts, and market data covering daily trade count, average trade volume, and market caps.
Another noteworthy feature available on the DEX is theautomated trading view alerts. Users can automate their trading decisions around different price level alerts, automatically executing the trade when a predetermined price threshold is reached. This can encompass a transaction like a stop-loss order, but also allows users to set trades based on price movement in either direction.
Finally, you have the decentralized wallet and the address book. Cryptocurrencies.AI's DEX is available through multiple different web browser wallets, making it highly accessible. When you click on the'Wallet'tab, you have the option to create a new wallet or restore an existing wallet using your seed phrase. Cryptocurrencies.AI offers its own native wallet, making it extremely easy to access the platform safely with just a password to unlock.
The Cryptocurrencies.AI wallet can support a wide variety of assets and can conduct transactions with negligible fees because it’s built on Solana’s scalable blockchain. The address book is another valuable bonus feature, making it easy to automatically send cryptocurrency to any preexisting address that you have linked the account with.
Creating a Better Cryptocurrency Exchange Experience
All-in-all,Cryptocurrencies.AIis accomplishing its goal of serving the entirety of the cryptocurrency investor market. By offering both CEX and DEX, it can offer all the features that traders crave, all hosted on a single platform. Through the introduction of deep liquidity pools, extensive trading pairs, and technical analytics, Cryptocurrencies.AI places the tools for successful trading in the hands of novice and experienced traders alike.

49823,2021-05-06 20:00:48,Goldman launches cryptocurrency trading team: memo,"(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Friday revealed details on its cryptocurrency trading group, according to a staff memo seen by Reuters.
The trading group, whose formation Reuters reported in March, has been buying and selling bitcoin futures on CME Group and non-deliverable forwards, according to the memo.
The announcement is further evidence that Wall Street is accepting and adopting the digital currency. It follows rival bank Morgan Stanley's move to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds in recent months.
The two derivatives the trading group is handling allow investors to take a view on bitcoin's future price. The contracts are settled in cash and Goldman does not have to deal with the physical asset, which it ""is not in a position to trade,"" according to the memo.
The trading group will be a part of Goldman's global currencies and emerging markets division and will report to Goldman partner Rajesh Venkataramani, according to CNBC, which first reported the memo on Friday.
Bitcoin remains highly volatile. On Friday, bitcoin was up roughly 2.4% at $57,305.

53915,2021-05-18 06:37:00,GBP/USD Daily Forecast – Test Of Resistance At 1.4180,"GBP/USD Video 18.05.21.
GBP/USDhas recently made an attempt to settle above the resistance at 1.4180 while the U.S. dollar remained under pressure against a broad basket of currencies.
The U.S. Dollar Index has managed to settle below the support at 90.30 and is trying to get to the test of the support at 90. In case the U.S. Dollar Index declines below 90, it will move towards the support at 89.75 which will be bullish for GBP/USD.
The UK has just reported thatClaimant Count Changedecreased from 10,100 in March to -15,100 in April compared to analyst consensus of 25,000. Unemployment Rate report for March showed thatUnemployment Ratedeclined from 4.9% in February to 4.8% in March while analysts expected that it will remain unchanged at 4.9%. Both reports indicated that the UK job market continued to recover.
Today, foreign exchange market traders will also have a chance to take a look at the latest housing market data from the U.S. Analysts expect thatBuilding Permitsdeclined by 0.9% month-over-month in April after growing by 2.7% in March.Housing Startsare projected to decline by 2.8%.
It should be noted that Building Permits and Housing Starts stay near multi-year high levels so some correction on a month-over-month basis does not signal any notable weakness.
GBP/USD managed to get above the resistance at 1.4150 and is trying to settle above the next resistance at 1.4180. In case GBP/USD manages to settle above this level, it will head towards the resistance which is located at February highs at 1.4240.
A successful test of the resistance at 1.4240 will open the way to the test of the resistance at 1.4280. If GBP/USD gets above this level, it will head towards the next resistance at 1.4345. It should be noted that GBP/USD has not visited this territory since 2018 so it remains to be seen whether previous levels will be relevant for today’s trading.
On the support side, the previous resistance at 1.4150 will serve as the first support level for GBP/USD. If GBP/USD manages to settle below this level, it will move towards the support at 1.4120. A move below this level will open the way to the test of the support at 1.4080.

It can be difficult to pick winners in such a saturated space. Insider has asked several experts about where they see the biggest opportunities in altcoins. See more stories on Insider's business page . Cryptocurrencies have exploded in popularity over the last several months. Of course, the most popular remains bitcoin . But some other smaller cryptos are gaining serious steam as well, as the concept of digital currencies continues to seep into the public consciousness. However, it can be difficult to know which cryptocurrencies to invest in, or whether you should in the first place. There are currently thousands of different types of coins on the market. And some - like dogecoin, which was founded as a joke - don't appear to be serious. Others, like some built on the Ethereum blockchain, appear to have better use cases. And overall, there are legitimate concerns over whether the altcoin boom is unsustainable and will soon come crashing down. Crypto is an esoteric domain - its intricacies can be difficult to understand, especially for those new to the space. To help cut through the noise, Insider has talked to several experts about which altcoins - cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin - they believe have the best upside. These experts also described the fundamentals and technicals that make these altcoins attractive. Their views are shared in the articles below. img hed with link and appendage blurb Coach JV, crypto investor and founder of 3T Warrior Academy.

77131,2024-12-04 10:04:00,"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF, ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF, MicroStrategy and Coinbase Global","Chicago, IL – December 4, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF IBIT, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF FBTC, ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF ARKB, MicroStrategy MSTR and Coinbase Global COIN.
Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stockCoinbase Globaloperates the largest crypto exchange in the United States by trading volume. Coinbase benefits from global crypto adoption with its widespread sweet of unique crypto offerings.
After COIN debuted during the “crypto winter” of 2021, shares suffered amid falling crypto prices and the demise of its largest competitor, FTX. However, the company’s shares and fundamentals are rebounding rapidly amid widespread global crypto adoption, innovations, and a robust balance sheet. Below are some reasons why the momentum in Coinbase will continue.
A significant roadblock in the crypto industry has been converting fiat currency into crypto seamlessly. Monday, Coinbase announced an initiative to smoothen the process. The Coinbase website wrote, “Today, we’re excited to announce the launch of ApplePay for all fiat-to-crypto purchases via Coinbase Onramp, the easiest tool to build onramps into your existing products.”
Earlier this year, Coinbase also announced a strategic partnership with payment giant Stripe to “expand global adoption.” The Stripe and Apple deals represent a landmark moment for Coinbase, which appears to be the de facto choice for legacy payment giants. These deals put COIN in the poll position to take advantage of further global crypto adoptions.
Coinbase arguably benefits from the Donald Trump presidential victory more than any other stock on Wall Street. President-elect Trump announced during his campaign that he plans to fire Securities and Exchange head Gary Gensler on day one. Gensler has been enemy number one of COIN because he has failed to provide regulatory clarity to Coinbase on whether certain assets should be treated as securities or commodities.
Though Trump has yet to step foot back in the White House, investors are bidding up “alt coins” with vengeance in an effort to discount the future. For instance, Ripple, a crypto locked in legal battles for years, is up more than 300% since the election.
The robust price action and flurry of volume are major catalysts for Coinbase which charges hefty commissions, ranging between 0.5% to 4.5% depending on the coin.
Thus far, the performance and flows into Bitcoin ETFs such as theiShares Bitcoin Trust ETF,Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETFandARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETFhave been unprecedented. The company stands to benefit Because Coinbase acts as the custody servicer for most crypto ETFs. Meanwhile, COIN may benefit further as public companies look to mirrorMicroStrategy’swildly successful “Bitcoin Standard.”
After breaking out on election day, COIN shares are coiling in a picture-perfect bull flag pattern. Meanwhile, heavy-handed, long-term-focused call option buyers continue to enter the market, providing conviction to the current chart pattern.
Coinbase boasts a sparkling balance sheet and a growing cash hoard despite the crypto industry’s “Wild West” reputation.
Coinbase is the true market leader in the crypto industry. The stock should benefit from global crypto adoption, strategic partnerships, and a strong balance sheet.

Coinbase (COIN)
Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Coinbase Global is the leading cryptocurrency exchange in the United States. Coinbase allows users to buy, sell, and trade various cryptocurrencies. Since going public in 2021, COIN investors have endured a crypto winter, an equity bear market, and scrutiny from regulators.
Catalysts
Bitcoin is strong and is ready to break-out
Like most crypto-related stocks, COIN is correlated to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has shown relative strength as of late. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s volatility has fallen sharply – a hint that a big move may be around the corner.
Image Source: TradingView
ETF Approval
Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, recently said it is a“question of when, not if”Bitcoin ETFs get approved. Because COIN is the custodian exchange listed forBlackrock (BLK)and for every ETF listed, this is a significant catalyst for the firm.
COIN Is likely to win the lawsuit against SEC
Last month, a US judge ruled that XRP token purchases via exchanges were not securities transactions. The ruling was a surprise win for XRP parent Ripple and a hint that COIN will likely win its ongoing legal battle versus the SEC.
Strong Balance Sheet
In an uncharacteristic statement, legendary value investor Seth Klarman recently stated,“Coinbase is sitting on $5 billion in cash, has less than that in debt, and is doing some smart things.”

Tesla (TSLA)
Tesla is the pioneer and leader in the electric vehicle (EV) market. The company’s EVs gained widespread acclaim and adoption because of their performance, range, and advanced technology.
Exponential EV Growth
The EV market is growing at a blistering rate and is expected to continue growing. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), between 2020 and 2022, the share of electric car sales rocketed from about 4% to 14%.
Image Source: IEA
Rising oil and gas prices and a more extensive charging network should also spur growth.
Buybacks and Investments
At the start of 2023, Tesla CEO Elon Musk was concerned about a potential recession. However,Bank of America (BAC)analysts and other Wall Street juggernauts are flipping and expect that the economy is likely to avert a recession and have a” soft landing.” With recession concerns in the rear-view mirror, Musk is likely to put the growing cash hoard the company has to use in the form of stock buybacks or investments.
Cybertruck Launch
Tesla will soon start mass production of its one-of-a-kind Cybertruck. If the Cybertruck is anything like the other Tesla vehicles, it will be a hit (its high margin, too!).
Baidu (BIDU)
Baidu is China’s largest search engine and the equivalent of China’sAlphabet (GOOGL).BIDU owns 75% of the search market in China, however, it is growing beyond just search.
Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Baidu is the Chinese leader in AI and is bound to take advantage of being the “first mover” in the Chinese market. The search giant is launching an “Ernie Bot” AI service that the company claims is more powerful thanMicrosoft (MSFT)and OpenAI’s wildly popular ChatGPT. Regardless of whether or not that’s true, Baidu enjoys the fact that US websites are blocked in China.
Rebounding Economy
Between a sinking economy and a government crackdown, BIDU and other public Chinese companies have endured the proverbial “kitchen sink” being thrown at them. However, recently, the government is showing signs of becoming more business-friendly and is hinting at government stimulus into year-end. BIDU is benefitting from rising equity prices in China. For example, theiShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI)is up more than 20% off its 2022 lows.

By Robert Ross
Bitcoin celebrated its 11th birthday on January 3. And what a party it's been, with the world's first and most famous cryptocurrency now trading near $40,000.
Warren Buffett famously referred to Bitcoin as ""rat poison squared."" The Oracle of Omaha might never own the King of Cryptos. But even he has to admit that it is charting a path higher… one that is as unique as the asset itself.
Bitcoin once shot up 1,882% in a little under a year. It went from $998 in January 2017 to $19,783 in December 2017. One year later, itdroppedaround 83% to $4,935.
Now we’re back in a Bitcoin bull market. Since the March 2020 lows, Bitcoin’s price has rallied over 500%. And there are plenty of reasons to believe it's going to go a lot higher.
Most people can’t stomach that much volatility and risk. And you don't have to. Nor do you have to miss out on the next leg of the Bitcoin bull market.
Even better, you don't have to spend as much as a base-modelTesla (TSLA)on a single stake.
You are familiar with financial exchanges. These are companies that facilitate the buying and selling of stocks, bonds, commodities, and now—you guessed it—bitcoin.
Some of these exchanges support futures trading. At its simplest level, futures contracts let people bet on how much the price of something will rise or fall.
Now, I'm not recommending you trade Bitcoin futures. But you can make money off the trading action. That's because the exchanges charge fees for these transactions.
When trading volume goes up, like it is now, so does the bottom line of the exchanges.
And now, so can yours…
CME Group (CME)operates the leading Bitcoin futures exchange. And business is booming.
The company reported record volume on its Bitcoin futures exchange on May 13. It processed 33,700 contracts, equal to $1.35 billion.
And this is a sliver of its $5 billion-per-year business. That's why CME Group can pay a safe and stable 1.6% dividend.
Then there’s the cherry on top: The company has a history of paying aspecial dividendevery year. So a special dividend could more than double CME’s dividend yield.
The second company on my list isIntercontinental Exchange (ICE).
The company introduced its bitcoin exchange in September 2019. It’s been a huge hit, as the company saw 16,000 contracts trade on a single day in September 2020.
That was 36% more than the previous record set in July 2020.
While ICE’s dividend is small at 1%, it’s rock-solid. The company has strong free cash flow and has a five-year average payout ratio of 27%.
I think Bitcoin is going to smash a lot more recordsin the future when it comes to the price of this cryptocurrency and the trading volume on exchanges like CME and ICE.
Both of these stocks are trading in the triple digits. Not only do they offer a less expensive way to bet on big-ticket Bitcoin, but they pay you to wait for the King of Cryptos to trade even higher.
My brand-new special report tells you everything about profiting from “sin stocks” (gambling, tobacco, and alcohol). These stocks are much safer and do twice as well as other stocks simply because most investors try to avoid them.Claim your free copy.

68534,2023-05-19 23:13:36,"The Bitcoin Price Didnt Hit $1 Million in 90 Days as Predicted, But New Crypto ICO Copium Hit $8 Million in 5 Minutes","New York, NY --News Direct-- Finance News Former Coinbase CTO and crypto expert Balaji Srinivasan made headlines earlier in 2023 with a bold Bitcoin price prediction - that the flagship cryptocurrency would embark on another bull run and hit $1 million within 90 days. Bullish Bitcoin Price Prediction Fails, Meme Coins Take the Spotlight Srinivasans Bitcoin prediction was made in March, and with the deadline on his three-month Bitcoin target just around the corner, he has now conceded on the bet, according to Forbes . However, interest in crypto has still reached a fever pitch - it just hasnt been directed at Bitcoin. Instead its new meme coins that have taken centre stage, with a much lower market capitalization than BTC giving them room to explode by a much higher percentage in a shorter period of time. With a small meme token, a 5,000% gain is not uncommon, which is what Bitcoin would have needed to rise from around $20,000 to $1,000,000. Copium Token ICO Leads to Huge Pump This week Copium token exploded by several hundred percent following its initial coin offering (ICO) on Uniswap, reaching an $8 million valuation within the space of five minutes. $COPIUM joins a long list of meme coins hoping to be the next $PEPE, which rose over 100,000% in a single month in 2023 since its own ICO. New Crypto ICOs vs Investing in Bitcoin Investing in new cryptocurrency projects early in their roadmap, at the initial coin offering or initial DEX offering (IDO) stage - sometimes simply called the initial exchange offering (IEO) is a high risk, high reward strategy. If a new crypto project delivers on the promises of its whitepaper, buying at such an early point often has much more potential upside in the short term than investing in Bitcoin. The Bitcoin price so far in 2023 for example, rose 87% from trough to peak - with a yearly open of $16,540 on Binance and reaching a high of $31,000 in April. Early investors that take a gamble on a new crypto coin, from the presale or ICO stage, can outperform that rate of return in a matter of minutes, even in seconds. While the Bitcoin price is down 8% in May, new meme coins have still been exploding, as buyers seek out the latest new meme crypto project. Story continues Bitcoin has a market cap of $520 billion, relative to new crypto projects which often launch with a market cap of well under $1 million. The Copium Club Project Following in the footsteps of assets like Pepe (PEPE), Sponge (SPONGE), Wojak (WOJAK) and Generational Wealth (GEN), that are based around recognizable internet memes - known by millions around the world even outside of cryptocurrency investors - Copium token adopts the simple MS Paint style wojak meme often seen on social media including in crypto Twitter circles. Associated with overcoming adversity or rationalizing a position - being told to cope or keep coping - the simple meme is universal and appeals to people regardless of their location in the world, political beliefs or native tongue. The wojak internet meme has become as well-known as the Pepe the frog meme, and is expected to continue to grown in the run-up to the 2024 US elections. The copium.club website tagline is  how hard can you cope , and the growing community in its Copium Club are part of a movement. The homepage describes the project with the introduction: Bought the top, anon? Did your favorite influencer use you as exit liquidity? Were you part of a Ponzi scheme that left your bags worthless while others walked away with generational wealth? We feel your pain, and we're here to help you cope. $COPIUM now has over 2,100 holders and is listed on Uniswap, MEXC, LBank and Poloniex. Currently up approximately 400% from its listing price, Copium token initially rose almost 1,000%, reaching an $8 million market cap within five minutes . Cryptocurrency ICOs Continue to Make Headlines Interest in new meme crypto ICOs was spurred on by news Tron CEO Justin Sun would begin buying and trading promising meme cryptocurrencies publicly. Meme token mania shows no signs of slowing down, noticed by New York Magazine who stated that assets like $PEPE and $SPONGE were even causing big problems for Bitcoin - the high trading volume of meme coins was in part blamed for the recent network congestion issues that caused Binance to pause Binance withdrawals temporarily. It remains to be seen if $COPIUM can achieve the same level of notoriety, but the new crypto project has a strong backing so far, including from cryptocurrency influencers Cozomo de Medici and FaZe Banks .

9255,2017-12-10 17:03:40,"After bitcoin’s wild week, traders brace for futures launch","By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The newest way to bet on bitcoin will arrive on Sunday, when futures of the cryptocurrency that has taken Wall Street by a storm begin trading.
The first bitcoin future trades are set to kick off at 6 p.m. EST (2300 GMT) on CBOE Global Markets Inc's CBOE Futures Exchange.
This has given an extra kick to the cryptocurrency's scorching run this year. Bitcoin's price soared so far this month, but it has made sharp moves in both directions in recent days, falling by almost a fifth on Friday after surging more than 40 percent in the previous 48 hours.
On Sunday, bitcoin was up about 3 percent at $15,000 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange. On the Gemini Exchange, it was at $15,650.
Bitcoin fans appear excited about the prospect of an exchange-listed and regulated product and the ability to bet on its price swings without having to sign up for a digital wallet. Others, however, caution that risks remain for investors and possibly even the clearing organizations underpinning the trades.
The futures are cash-settled contracts based on the auction price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on the Gemini Exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.
""The pretty sharp rise we have seen in bitcoin in just the last couple of weeks has probably been driven by optimism ahead of the futures launch,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.
""You are going to open up the market to a whole lot of people who aren't currently in bitcoin,"" Frederick said.
The futures are an alternative to a largely unregulated spot market underpinned by cryptocurrency exchanges that have been plagued by cybersecurity and fraud issues.
The launch has so far received a mixed reception from big U.S. banks and brokerages, though.
Interactive Brokers Group Inc plans to offer its customers access to the first bitcoin futures when trading goes live but will bar clients from assuming short positions and has margin requirements of at least 50 percent.
Several online brokerages, including Charles Schwab Corp and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp, will not allow trading of the new futures immediately.
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and other large U.S. banks will not immediately clear bitcoin trades for clients, the Financial Times reported on Friday.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Thursday it was planning to clear such trades for certain clients.
VOLATILITY DAMPENER
Bitcoin's manic run-up this year has boosted volatility far in excess of other asset classes. The futures trading may help dampen some of the sharp moves, analysts said.
""Hypothetically, volatility over the long run should drop after institutions get involved,"" said Ophir Gottlieb, chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based Capital Market Laboratories. ""But there may not be an immediate impact, say in the first month.""
Placing futures on an underlying spot market can lend more order to spot trading in the long run by helping to determine the proper price of a security and by allowing investors to express both bullish and bearish biases, said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.
Analysts warn, however, against trying to predict how the futures will perform, given that bitcoin is unlike any other asset.
""This is completely unknown territory,"" said Charles Schwab's Frederick.
Bitcoin's meteoric price rise has raised worries that it could collapse soon, although analysts have little concern that this could hurt broader financial markets because the cryptocurrency lacks correlation with other risky assets and is held and traded largely outside the banking sector.
However, there are still fears of inaccurate pricing and systemic risk to clearing houses, should prices move sharply and clients fail to meet margin calls. Brokers have called for more safeguards to protect against bitcoin's high volatility.
The risk that investors might manipulate the underlying spot market to benefit in the futures market is another big concern.
""Large equity indexes show some volatility around cash settlements, and those are in highly liquid, highly regulated venues,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief options strategist at Interactive Brokers in Greenwich, Connecticut.
""Compare that to cash settlement in bitcoin, and there is a lot more uncertainty on how that would play out.""

MSCI AxJ index eyes 3% drop this week
By Tom Westbrook
SYDNEY, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Asian stocks limped toward a fourth straight weekly decline on Friday and bonds nursed big losses as investors scrambled to catch up with the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate outlook, while currency markets were on edge at the end of a wild week.
Fed members' projections for aggressive hikes and persistently high rates over the next year or so has unleashed another round of dollar buying that put other assets on the run.
World stocks hit two-year lows on Thursday and are down 3% this week. The euro and yen fell to 20-year lows and on Thursday, Japanese authorities stepped in to the market for the first time since 1998 to buy yen and arrest its slide.
The resultant spike has the yen up to 142.20 per dollar and on course for its best week in more than a month and has, for now, tapped the brakes on broader dollar gains.
In regional markets MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.5% to a two-year low. It is down 3% this week. Japan's Nikkei was closed for a public holiday marking the autumn equinox.
Overnight, Wall Street indexes fell and longer-dated U.S. Treasuries were dumped - sending the 10-year yield up about 20 basis points to 3.71% - as traders tried to adjust to the prospect of U.S. interest rates above 4% for some time.
""The 10-year was playing catch up to the newly calibrated cash rate,"" said Westpac's head of rates strategy, Damien McColough, in Sydney.
""If you believe the front-end is going to peak at 4.60% can you really sustain 10-year bond yields at 3.70%?"" he said.
""It's very skittish price action ... I think that this volatility continues in all markets in the near term (until) the rates market settles.""
S&P 500 futures drifted 0.1% higher and European futures rose 0.4% early in the Asia session.
INTERVENTION
Interest rates are rising sharply almost everywhere in the world, with Britain, Sweden, Switzerland and Norway among hikers this week - driving heavy selling in European bond markets, particularly of gilts.
But the Fed's outlook has overshadowed that in the currency market as both safety flows and higher yields help the greenback, while an energy crisis and war on the doorstep weighs down the euro.
Preliminary manufacturing surveys in Europe and Britain's new finance minister announcing his ""Growth Plan"" highlight the day ahead.
The euro was last at $0.9844, a fraction over Thursday's 20-year trough at $0.9807 -- although all eyes are on the yen.
Japan has not disclosed the size or details of its yen buying, but dollar/yen took two large legs lower during late Asia and London trading on Thursday and the risk of another is probably enough to scare off speculators for a while.
""It changes the market dynamic in terms of risks-reward for short-term players,"" said UBS strategist James Malcolm.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars hovered near their lowest levels since mid 2020, with the Aussie last at $0.6638 and the kiwi at $0.5852.
Sterling was parked by its lowest in nearly four decades at $1.1226.
China's yuan, at 7.0964 per dollar in offshore trade on Friday, is near its lowest in more than two years and within striking distance of a record low.
In commodity markets oil is eying a small weekly loss as rate hikes raise demand concerns. Brent crude futures hovered at $90.58 in Asia on Friday.
Gold, which pays no income, has suffered as U.S. yields have gone up and it was last flat at $1,671 an ounce.
Bitcoin has been likewise battered amidst the flight from risky assets and held at $19,322.

• The first grant from the new fund went to Sayl, a customer relationship management platform.
• This comes only a week after the foundation launched a $155 million DeFi fund.
On Thursday,HederaHashgraph announced its latest venture fund, in which it will invest $250 million in HBAR tokens for Metaverse development.
The HBAR Foundation revealed that it has set aside $250 million in a new fund aimed at drawing in both consumer brands and their users to Hedera Hashgraph’s metaverse ecosystem.
The fund also aims to provide ‘a major acceleration force’ for gaming, virtual worlds, fashion,NFTs, consumer brands, social platforms, the creator economy, and enterprises to enter the Hedera ecosystem.
The recent Metaverse fund announcement, made by the HBAR Foundation, comes merely a week after the network launched a $155 million ‘CryptoEconomy Fund’ focused ondecentralized finance (DeFi).
Furthermore, apress releaseby HBAR Foundation highlights that the Metaverse Fund targets both B2C and B2B2C applications that will onboard users at scale into Web3 and de facto into the Hedera ecosystem. Beyond that, the fund focused on the growth of Hedera users and network TVL.
Additionally, the fund also drives the development of NFT markets and SI Partner expertise and hopes to bring users into Web 3 and its ecosystem.
HBAR’s long-term price trend looks largely bearish, as the coin was down 61% from its all-time high set in September 2021. However, the current price action turned bullish amid external developments.
At press time, HBAR traded at $0.22, noting a 3.73% uptick over 24-hours. On a daily chart, HBAR’s price saw a decent push as the news of the new Metaverse fund came out. However, the coin still oscillated below the crucial $0.259 resistance.
In the short term, the coin’s move above the $0.259 resistance could further confirm bullish momentum. For now, since HBAR traded close to the $0.226 support line keeping the price trajectory above the same could act in favor of the bulls.
Hedera is known for its distributed ledger technology (DLT), which was recently madeEthereumVirtual Machine (EVM)-compatible.

The Central Bank of Kenya took out local newspaper ads this week to warn citizens of the dangers of crypto-currencies like Bitcoin. CBK – “Bitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya” #statusquo pic.twitter.com/mdmkxTGMUx — Winter soldier (@Neloversion) December 15, 2015 Among the concerns it raises: Once again, Norway has been voted the best country in the world for humans Virtual currencies are traded in exchange platforms that tend to be unregulated all over the world. Consumers may therefore lose their money without having any legal redress in the event these exchanges collapse or close business. The public should therefore desist from transacting in Bitcoin and similar products. The CBK isn’t just following the lead of other governments that have warned citizens to steer clear of the unregulated virtual currency. It also is wading into a widening spat between the country’s dominant telecom, Safaricom, and an upstart remittances company that uses Bitcoin, called Bitpesa. Bitpesa and another start up, Lipisha, are both suing Safaricom for intimidation and cessation of service without notice for blocking their access to Safaricom’s widely used mobile money platform, Mpesa. The day before the central bank’s ad appeared, a Kenyan High Court judge ruled that Safaricom does not have to grant Bitpesa and its partner access while the court case proceeds. Ironically, the fight is between two companies that are both using technology to improve life for Africa’s emerging but still disadvantaged middle and working classes. Mpesa enables customers—including millions who are “unbanked”—to transfer, use, or store cash on their cell phones. It has helped raise the rate of Kenyan adults with access to formal financial services from to 67% in 2014, up from 41% in 2009. The platform also is being used for a range of other projects, from improving healthcare to giving rural areas access to solar power . Story continues Bitpesa, founded by former development professionals working in micro-finance, aims to reduce the high cost of money transfers for Africans living and working away from home. Africans spend double the global average rate to send remittances. Through Bitpesa, users can transfer bitcoin and then convert it into Kenyan shillings. The two-year-old company has raised more than $1.7 million from investors. “We were fans of the innovation that Safaricom first shared with Kenya and the region back in 2007-2009, and we watched as other companies built upon this first mobile money network, with iterations taking the technology to places Safaricom alone could never go,” Bitpesa co-founder Elizabeth Rossiello wrote in a Dec. 14 blog post . The debate over how to regulate Bitcoin also encapsulates the competing interests of innovation and status quo in a country that is dubbed East Africa’s “Silicon Savannah.” Safaricom, founded in 1997, is one of the country’s most established telecom firms and its largest mobile network provider. It has defended its decision to block Bitpesa by saying the startup does not meet anti-money-laundering laws. (Bitpesa counters that it does not fall under such regulations.) Observers point out the fact that Safaricom is also entering the remittances industry with a partnership between South Africa’s MTN Group and its parent company Vodafone that will allow users in both networks , which covers most of east and central Africa, to transfer money across the region on their phones. One of Bitpesa’s board members and investors, Joseph Mucheru has been nominated to be the country’s cabinet secretary for information and communications technology. He has said that once he is sworn in he will divest from the company, but his views are clear. He told a local newspaper , “It will be a sad day if we fail to embrace this because we are afraid. Kenya cannot be the tech hub of Africa if our own regulations stifle innovation.” But at least for now, Kenya’s central bank seems to think the caution is worth the tradeoff.

69529,2023-08-30 20:36:00,"Bitcoin Slips to $27.2K, Cryptos Dip as Investors Digest Grayscale’s Court Win","Bitcoin (BTC) pulled back from yesterday’s high above $28,000 on Wednesday as investors mulled the implications of Grayscale’scourt victoryover the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The largest cryptocurrency by market cap was down 2% over the past 24 hours to $27,240. Ether (ETH) slightly outperformed, sinking 1.7% in the past 24 hours and hovering just above $1,700..
The broader crypto market mirrored the two leading assets’ move, with theCoinDesk Market Indexdipping 2.4%.
Cardano’sADA, Solana’sSOLand Polygon’sMATICled the decline among major altcoins, falling near 4% during the day and erasing most of their Tuesday advance.
A federal appeals court yesterday ordered the SEC to review its rejection of investment manager Grayscale’s bid to convert its $14 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF),spurring an immediate rallyin digital asset prices and crypto-related stocks.
Market observershailedthe decision as a landmark win that could potentiallypave the wayfor a spot BTC ETF in the future. During the summer, a flurry of investment firms applied or renewed their bid to list such a product, including traditional finance giant BlackRock. Still, yesterday’s rulingdoes not automatically guaranteean approval of Grayscale’s or any other firm’s application.
While it’s too early to tell how sustainable Tuesday’s price jump was, “there are some small signs that we could see a slight reversal,” Clara Medalie, director of research at Kaiko, said in an interview with CoinDeskTV.
Notably, the rally was accompanied by modest trading volumes on exchanges relative to other “mini bull markets,” spiking only to a two-week high, Medalie said. Trading volume represents market participants’ engagement in the market, she explained, thus the lackluster volume figure could signal some weakness behind the move.
However,average BTC buy orders jumpedto the highest since June, suggesting activity from large investors, which Medalie evaluated as “good news.”
“A wave of ETF approvals could definitely be the bullish catalyst the crypto market needs right now,” she said, adding that “we are still in the middle of a tumultuous period for the industry with quite a few bankruptcies and lawsuits ongoing.”
Market analyst Garreth Soloway forecasted further downside for bitcoin’s price in case it fails to break decisively above the $28,000 level where it traded before mid-August sell-off.
“$28,000 is the price level at which the BTC price broke down. It is not uncommon for price to retrace to that level after a correction,” he explained in an emailed note. “BTC is still most likely to break down from the current levels, and the longer BTC trades sideways, the further the probable price decline.”
The support level to watch is around $25,000, the price at which bitcoin sat in mid-June when Blackrock filed for a spot BTC ETF, Soloway added.",27282.93,-0.02,27276.07,-0.05,27266.84,-0.08,27285.59,-0.01,27289.68
86265,2024-07-25 21:16:21,"Jersey City to Invest in Bitcoin ETFs, the Latest Pension to Dive Into Crypto","The municipal pension plan of Jersey City, New Jersey, will soon invest in bitcoin via exchange-traded funds, according to a Thursday social media post from Mayor Steven Fulop.
While it's not likely to be a gigantic sum, the decision is another symbolic win for cryptocurrency on the road toward wider adoption. The move follows a Wisconsin pension making asimilar decisionearlier this year.
Read more:As a Pension Embraces Bitcoin, Hope Grows for Cryptocurrency's Long-Term Prospects Even Among Conservative Pros
Fulop, who has been the mayor of Jersey City since 2013, took to X (formerly Twitter) to announce the forthcoming investment, writing: “Not my normal subject matter in a post but I’ll share anyway – the question on whether [c]rypto/Bitcoin is here to stay is largely over [and] crypto/Bitcoin won.”
Fulop, a Democrat, has thrown his hat into the ring for New Jersey’s 2025 gubernatorial election. Incumbent Governor Phil Murphy, also a Democrat, has already served two terms and is ineligible for reelection.
Fulop added that the city’s pension fund, the Employees Retirement System of Jersey City, is currently in the process of updating paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allocate a percentage of the fund to bitcoin {{BTC}} ETFs. According to Fulop’s tweet, the investment is expected to be completed “by end of the summer.”
Though Fulop did not specify exactly how much of the pension funds' assets under management will be allocated to bitcoin ETFs, he said it would be “similar” to the 2% allocation to bitcoin ETFs made by Wisconsin’s state pension fund earlier this year. Fulop did not specify which bitcoin ETF Jersey City was considering selecting for its investment.
“I’ve been a long time believer (through ups/downs) in crypto but [b]roadly, beyond crypto [I] do believe blockchain is amongst the most important new technology innovations since the internet,” Fulop said.
Interest in bitcoin from public pension funds is growing slowly but surely.
Wisconsin’s public pension plan – the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which has roughly $156 billion in assets under management – is the biggest pension plan to dive into crypto so far, with a $160 million investment into spot bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. Some small pension funds like the Houston Firefighters’ Relief and Retirement Fund, which has about $5 billion in assets under management, have been invested in crypto for several years.
The pensions of Fairfax County, Virginia, also invested in crypto exposure through VanEck's New Finance Income Fund, whichbecame a creditorto crypto firm Genesis as it filed for bankruptcy last year.

Rippled suits?In Matt Levine’s much-awaited return to his opinion-heavy Bloomberg newsletter, Money Stuff, the financial columnistwroteabout the effects of securities fraud action on business environments. In the U.S., he writes, there’s a growing trend that “everything is securities fraud.” Making a bad video game that causes a gaming studio’s stock to drop: securities fraud. Harboring a culture of harassment: securities fraud. Playing up a news release for something insignificant: securities fraud.
Though Levine’s headline calls it a “dystopian future,” his conclusion is a bit more positive. A culture where smart lawyers can find restitution for stockholders affected by negative performance is a “general” way to keep publicly traded firms from doing generically bad things, even if they are not affected by these actions in principle.

“Everything is securities fraud, even things that aren’t actually illegal; anything that gets bad press or moral disapprobation can lead to a securities lawsuit. It is in its way an oddly principles-based form of regulation: You don’t need specific rules against specific types of bad conduct; all you need is evidence that the company did a thing and the stock dropped because of it,” Levine concludes.
There aren’t many publicly traded companies in the crypto industry this trend might apply to, though the attitude – of pursuing legal action for any perceived or real financial loss – still pervades.
Yesterday, one of Ripple Labs’biggest financial backersfiled suit against the crypto incumbent to redeem its investment. Back in 2019, the multi-billion asset manager Tetragon Financial Group led Ripple’s $200 million Series C.
And now that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Ripple for potential securities fraud, Tetragon wants its cash back. Filed in Delaware, Tetragon said it will attempt to “enforce its contractual right to require Ripple to redeem” its preferred stock, Bloomberg reported, and even freeze Ripple’s assets until it pays up.
Ripple rejected the lawsuit, saying its investor can only redeem its equity for cash “if XRP is deemed to be a security on a go-forward basis,” according to a court filing.
While Tetragon isn’t claiming securities fraud on behalf of Ripple, it is an effect of an ongoing securities fraud investigation. The SEC claims Ripple raised $1.3 billion over a seven-year period by sellingXRPto retail investors. Ripple is the primary holder of XRP, though it has claimed over the years the network is sufficiently decentralized like Ethereum and that it is not the crypto’s creator.
Whether XRP is a security is now up for the courts to decide, but the lawsuit has already led to material outcomes.Grayscale Investments(sister company to CoinDesk) and Bitwise both removed XRP from their crypto index funds, while several exchanges have made moves todelistor suspend XRP trading.
One might wonder if XRP is deemed to be a security and Ripple found to have violated securities law, if exchanges might have the right to pursue legal action against the firm. Because, as Levine points out, litigiousness is baked into U.S. business culture.

ETH on-chain analysis (January 2022),"As Ethereum appears poised and ready for a potential breakout, Coin Rivet investigates Ethereum (ETH) on-chain for the month of January and walks you through the Ether charts. Howre things looking on exchanges? To begin unpacking the on-chain sentiment surrounding current ETH price action, the percent balance on exchanges is an ideal starting point  representing how much Ether is currently sat primed and ready in users exchange wallets. The chart below highlights a crucial moment  on December 4  in the aftermath of damaging Fed data and uncertainty around the Omicron variant the entire cryptomarket saw the onset of a bearish trend  market sentiment flipped sideways and Ether rushed back into exchange wallets for the first time since October 10. Percent Balance on Exchanges coin rivet january 2022 Source. A glance at the All Exchange Net Position Change Chart confirms the bearish price action was a turning point for Ethereum flows into exchanges. By January 5, an additional 476,953 ETH (around $1.5bn in value) had been moved into exchange wallets indicating the gunpowder for a significant sell-off in the event that support at $3,000 failed. Ethereum exchange net position change Source. Recent weeks show exchange inflows are now diminishing, with the net position change seemingly set to return to a net outflow in the near future. This provides reassurance that holders feel safe sat above $3,000 as twice-tested support  a strong piece of evidence for a bullish case  and stands indicative of a potential move from a market mentality of panic selling to one of accumulation. Wheres the sell-pressure been coming from? Speaking of panic sellers, a look at the iconic HODL waves chart can give us some insight into how price action ground down to $3,018. The initial sell-off in response to the Fed and Omicron news in early December appears to have been primarily driven by the Class of 17, with holders likely unsettled as TradFi markets started hitting the deck (or perhaps just a little scarred from 2017/8). Ethereum HODL waves January 2022 Source. But the real panic sell-off occurred on January 5 as bears took grip and forced a cascading dump that eventually caught support -23.6% later at $3,018. Sell pressure here came quite aggressively from coins last active three to six months ago. Story continues Ethereum total supply last active 3m-6m Source. A closer look at Total Supply Last Active three to six months ago  which would represent Ether bought between July and October 2021  shows that the majority of these holdings were sold. This will have been motivated by fears of a break below $3,000 as seen in the summer, as three-to-six-month holders opted to breakeven or strategized to buy-back-in lower. The HODL waves further evidence the view taken from the Exchange Balance charts, that Ether markets could be entering an accumulation period again. After all, three-to-five-year holds are growing, indicating no major sell-off from long-term project backers, and there is the glimmer of traction growing among one week to one month holds. All of this is indicative of the supply thaw ending. Read More: Latest Ethereum technical price analysis Has ETH already peaked? Finally, to round it off we ask the question: has ETH topped out yet?

15246,2018-01-26 01:01:00,Microsoft Acquires Avere: What Investors Need to Know,"For those of you new to the cloud, it's kind of a big deal. The overall cloud computing market will grow 22% this year, according to Forrester, and theemerging oligopolyof cloud infrastructure providers is solidifying with each service seeking to enhance its offerings for enterprise clients faced with more IT options than ever before.
That's whyMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT)just bought a small company out of Pittsburgh called Avere Systems. Though terms were not disclosed, here's what we know about Avere and why Microsoft made the purchase.
Image source: Getty Images.
Avere was founded back in 2008 -- when cloud computing was still in its infancy -- initially to make products and services to optimize storage resources in the data center. As cloud computing took hold, Avere expanded its hardware and software technologies as well, now an expert in optimizing storage and compute resources across a variety of locations -- whether they be in an on-premise data center, private cloud, or public cloud. The company's products span hardware, with its FXT Edge filers, software-based ""virtual"" Edge filers for use in public clouds, and its Avere Operating System, which allows clients to simplify their storage needs across a heterogeneous IT environment.
Basically, the company is a storage expert, helping customers increase speed, achieve visibility and simplicity, and save on costs. The cost savings are a big factor, as Avere's optimization of resources means customers won't have to buy more data center space than they need, or any more ""pay as you go"" cloud computing than is necessary. According Avere's website:
Avere FXT Edge filers offload the performance from your existing NAS [network-attached storage], enabling them to be built with cost-effective and dense nearline storage at a savings of 50% or more. [...] When you separate your performance from capacity, your physical costs go down. You need less space, less power, and less cooling even while performance improves. Operating expenses can stop climbing as the infrastructure gains performance in a smaller footprint.
Clients for Avere span media and entertainment, life sciences, education, government, and financial companies. Government agencies like the Centers for Disease Control, the Library of Congress, and even NASA use its services.
In ablog post, Jason Zander, VP of Microsoft Azure, wrote: ""Avere uses an innovative combination of file system and caching technologies to support the performance requirements for customers who run large-scale compute workloads. [...] customers will benefit from industry-leading innovations that enable the largest, most complex high-performance workloads to run in Microsoft Azure.""
Interestingly, Avere is not exclusive to Azure, as its virtual platforms also integrate with bothAmazonWeb Services and Google Cloud Platform. Avere has been integrating with Microsoft Azure since 2015.
It's unclear exactly why Microsoft bought Avere, though obviously the cloud giant thinks Avere's hybrid capabilities and products provide a point of differentiation. Microsoft may think it can expand Avere's offerings, or that a tightly integrated Avere will cause more clients to choose Azure as opposed to other platforms, or perhaps both. With Microsoft's experience in traditional enterprise data-center servers, it does seem best positioned out of the ""big three"" for hybrid cloud environments versus the 100% cloud offerings Amazon and Google bring to the table.
According to Synergy Research, Microsoft isgrowing the fastestof any cloud platform, and is solidly in second place in cloud infrastructure and platform as a service, behind only Amazon. With the Avere purchase, the company appears to be targeting hybrid cloud clients, with no signs of slowing down anytime soon.

83691,2023-02-27 14:30:00,Vortex Announces Investment Campaign To Expand Its Bitcoin Mining Capabilities,"DENVER , Feb. 27, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Vortex Brands, a Bitcoin mining company, has recently announced an ongoing growth and investment campaign to increase its Bitcoin mining power every month for the foreseeable future. By purchasing additional mining equipment, the company aims to increase the Bitcoin rewards earned, which is expected to increase in value as market conditions improve. Todd Higley , CEO of Vortex, said, ""We believe that now is the perfect time to ramp up our mining capabilities. Several variables are in our favor - the price of mining equipment is relatively low after a few years of sky-high prices, markets appear to be regaining momentum, and the SEC has made staking enemy number one - potentially good news for Bitcoin . We are excited to build on the amazing platform we have already established - it will be an adventure."" What Is Bitcoin Mining & How Does Vortex Achieve Success? Unsure how to mine Bitcoin ? Well, here it goes. Bitcoin mining solves highly complex mathematical equations to verify transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. To solve these equations, miners need access to specialist computer hardware equipment  which Vortex invests more money in. A miner's responsibility is to keep the blockchain safe and secure  but in this case, the miner is a computer, not a person. Essentially, it is a race to solve the equation successfully, and whichever miner does it first receives rewards in the form of Bitcoin . The more computing power you have, the greater likelihood you'll be the one verifying a transaction, hence why Vortex wants to increase its Bitcoin mining capabilities. The more reward they earn, the more they can re-invest and share greater profits with their shareholders. Without miners, Bitcoin and its blockchain would collapse and cease to exist. Vortex works alongside professional third-party data centers, known as Bitcoin farms, to ensure the utmost efficiency in mining performance. Here, their equipment is monitored, maintained, and able to function 24/7, with experts overseeing their progress. For a small fee, this takes Vortex's mining productivity to another level. Furthermore, as they collaborate with multiple data centers, they can ensure their equipment's safety. Whereas, if they kept them on their premises, one incident, such as a fire or burglary, could wipe out their entire operation. Story continues Discussion why third-party data centers are essential, Todd Higley said, ""For a Bitcoin mining company our size, it just makes sense. With our vision of continuous expansion, the more hardware we purchase, the larger space we need to operate. We work with partners we trust and know will ensure peak performance and the protection of our equipment. Overall, it saves us rent, 24/7 staff, and ongoing running and maintenance costs. It also removes a lot of hassle and stress."" How To Invest In Bitcoin Mining? To mine Bitcoin , you need specialist equipment and the ability to run it, and it's unlikely to be profitable as a lone miner. Joining a mining pool allows you to collate your power with others and split the rewards proportionally. Alternatively, investing in Bitcoin mining companies like Vortex contributes to expanding mining capabilities and increasing returns as the company grows. According to Todd Higley , Bitcoin mining could be a fruitful investment due to favorable market conditions. The end of the bear market is approaching, and Bitcoin appears to be the most viable and future-proof cryptocurrency .  "" Ethereum , one of Bitcoin 's largest rivals, will be impacted by the news that the SEC is potentially making staking illegal for retail traders."" About Vortex Brands Vortex Brands is a Bitcoin mining company launched by Todd Higley in 2022 that possesses impressive mining potential. The company has launched a campaign to increase the amount of Bitcoin mining equipment it has every month. To learn more about Vortex Brands, contact info@vortexbrands.us or visit vortexbrands.us .

13538,2018-01-16 19:14:00,Which Utility Is the Best Dividend Stock?,"Utilities tend to make excellent income stocks. That's because these companies generate relatively consistent earnings by supplying electricity and natural gas to consumers. With little need for that cash flow, they can return the bulk of it to investors. As a result, most utilities pay an above average dividend.
While there are dozens of publicly traded utilities in the U.S. to choose from, the four largest by market cap areNextEra Energy(NYSE: NEE),Duke Energy(NYSE: DUK),Southern Company(NYSE: SO), andDominion Energy(NYSE: D). Given their large-scale operations, these companies have a lower risk profile than smaller utilities, which is why it makes sense to focus our attention on these four main players to find the best dividend stock in the sector.
Image source: Getty Images.
Despite their large size, all four of these companies expect to grow their earnings and lucrative dividends at or above the industry average of 5% annually over the next several years:
[{""Utility"": ""Duke Energy"", ""Current Yield"": ""4.42%"", ""Earnings Growth Forecast"": ""4% to 6% annually through 2021"", ""Dividend Growth Forecast"": ""4% to 6% annual dividend growth""}, {""Utility"": ""Dominion Energy"", ""Current Yield"": ""4.00%"", ""Earnings Growth Forecast"": ""8%+ annually through 2020 with 5% thereafter"", ""Dividend Growth Forecast"": ""10% through 2020""}, {""Utility"": ""NextEra Energy"", ""Current Yield"": ""2.61%"", ""Earnings Growth Forecast"": ""6% to 8% annually through 2020"", ""Dividend Growth Forecast"": ""12% to 14% through 2018""}, {""Utility"": ""Southern Company"", ""Current Yield"": ""5.13%"", ""Earnings Growth Forecast"": ""5% annually"", ""Dividend Growth Forecast"": ""5% annually""}]
Data Source: Duke Energy, Dominion Energy, NextEra Energy, and Southern Company. Current yield as of Jan. 15. 2018.
That said, as that chart shows, Dominion offers investors the fastest growing dividend, which at a 10% annual clip through 2020, is nearly double the pace of Duke and Southern Company. To put that faster growth rate into perspective, here's what these stocks would yield in 2020 if they meet the mid-point of their dividend growth expectations:
[{""Utility"": ""Duke Energy"", ""Projected 2020 Yield"": ""5.22%"", ""Dividend Growth Assumptions"": ""5% annual growth through 2020""}, {""Utility"": ""Dominion Energy"", ""Projected 2020 Yield"": ""5.40%"", ""Dividend Growth Assumptions"": ""10% annual growth through 2020""}, {""Utility"": ""NextEra Energy"", ""Projected 2020 Yield"": ""3.38%"", ""Dividend Growth Assumptions"": ""A 13% increase in 2018 and 7% annual increases in 2019 and 2020""}, {""Utility"": ""Southern Company"", ""Projected 2020 Yield"": ""5.99%"", ""Dividend Growth Assumptions"": ""5% annual growth through 2020""}]
Data Source: Duke Energy, Dominion Energy, NextEra Energy, and Southern Company, with calculations by author.
As that table shows, Dominion's faster-growing payout would enable investors who buy today to collect a 5.4% yield on that investment in 2020, which would be higher than all but Southern Company. While that might make it seem like Southern Company is the better dividend stock, the yield is only part of the equation.
Image source: Getty Images.
All too often dividend-focused investors only seem to care about a stock's current yield. However, that payout only supplies a portion of their total return on investment. More often than not, a greater percentage of an investors' return comes from an increase in the company's value due to earnings growth, with stocks tending to rise alongside earnings.
This factor is where Dominion rises above the competition since it expects to grow earnings at a more than 8% annual clip through 2020, which leads its peer group. One of the drivers of that forecast is the company'srecently announced plans to acquirerival utilitySCANA Corporation(NYSE: SCG). That deal, if completed, would increase Dominion's earnings growth rate from its current forecast of 6% to 8% annually through 2020, up to more than 8% per year over that timeframe. Driving that acceleration is the fact that Dominion is buying SCANA for a low price due to thatutility's recent struggles, which will enable the transaction to boost Dominion's bottom line immediately.
That higher-end growth rate, however, should help Dominion generate higher total returns for investors over the next few years. For example, by adding the dividend yield to its earnings growth rate, Dominion would produce a 12% total annual return. For comparison's sake, the total return potential of both Duke and NextEra Energy would be in the range of 8% to 10% annually while Southern's would be about 10% annually.
While Dominion doesn't offer investors the highest dividend yield in its peer group, it still has the best dividend overall. That's because the company expects to increase that payout and grow its earnings by peer-leading rates through 2020. That faster-growing income stream increases the odds that Dominion can generate returns that should beat both its peer group and the market in the coming years, making it the top option in the sector to consider owning for the long-haul.

On the upcoming webcast,Meb Faber's Action Plan for International Investing in 2019, Meb Faber, Co-Founder and CIO of Cambria Investment Management, will take the pulse of the current market environment and consider global opportunities where investors may still find real value.
For instance, theCambria Global Value ETF (GVAL)  is the firm’s most popular ETF strategy. GVAL can help investors exploit valuation opportunities in markets outside the U.S. The fund invests in about 100 stocks from the world’s most undervalued markets, targeting the cheapest, most liquid picks in countries where political or economic crisis have depressed valuations.
The strategy tries to play on the historical attribute where future stock market returns tend to be lower when starting valuations are high and future returns tend to be higher when starting valuations are low.
The underlying index begins with a universe of 45 countries taken from developed and emerging markets. The Index then selects the top 25% cheapest country stock markets as measured by Cambria’s proprietary long term valuation metrics, similar to the CAPE ratio. It then uses a valuation composite across traditional metrics such as trailing P/E, P/B, P/S, P/FCF, and EV/EBITDA to screen for the 10 most undervalued stocks out of the top 30 largest stocks by market capitalization within each country.
""The GVAL ETF utilizes a quantitative approach to manage a portfolio of global equities. Global Value is a fundamentally focused deep value strategy with rules that are completely systematic,"" according to Cambria.
Top holdings include Corticeira Amorim 3.4%, Banco Santander Brasil 2.3%, Motor Oil Hellas SA 2.0%, Israel Discount Bank 1.8% and Nice Systems Ltd 1.8%.

66028,2021-02-10 07:00:00,Army Ant Limited Announces the Release of Its Encryption Mixer ANTUSDT,"LONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / February 10, 2021 /Recently, Army Ant has announced the release of its encryption mixer (coin shuffle) ANTUSDT.
""Weak Anonymity"" V.S the ""Black Money"", which one would users prefers? Digital currency is actually not completely anonymous (pseudo-anonymity), so the encryption mixer was born - ANTUSDT.
The digital currency address will not be linked to a real identity in real life, but if it is not done properly, it will. People can trace back to a particular transaction by associating multiple nodes in the blockchain, and then through the analysis of blockchain data and KYC/AML data, people can know who sent the transaction, and even include more details, such as location, reason of the transaction and so on.
The principle of coin shuffle:
What is coin shuffle?
Speaking of digital currency, it is easy to think of its two characteristics, one is decentralization, the other is anonymity. But the anonymity of cryptocurrencies is limited.
Although real-name authentication is not required, and the user's real identity cannot be matched by the address, the transaction on the blockchain is public. If someone deliberately looks for it, some clues can also be found through big data analysis, unless everyone is like Satoshi Nakamoto who is as cautious as possible. However, there is a service that can provide users with sufficiently high privacy protection, that is, coin shuffle services.
Coin shuffle, as the name implies, is to mix coins from different issuing addresses and then send them out. Through this process, the correspondence between the output address and input address of a transaction is cut off, thereby better protecting the privacy of users.
In fact, the process of coin shuffle is like a lot of people throwing coins into the wishing pool. If everyone throws in coins of 1 yuan, then people can know how many 1-yuan coins who throws in at what time, but when the staff cleans these coins and sorts them out, people cannot tell which coin was thrown in by whom.
Since the Bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger, it records every transaction on the Bitcoin network, and after coin shuffle, it is impossible to know which incoming transaction should correspond to which outgoing transaction. It is difficult to find out where and how much the cryptocurrency of the trader is stored, which protects user privacy to the greatest extent.
Under normal circumstances, coin shuffle for multiple times, with a small number of coins each time, is better.
Conclusion:
Coin shuffle is a privacy protection function, and coin shuffle transactions are difficult to track. The funds are mixed with the funds of other users, and a random relationship is created between the existing user's account system and the new account after coin shuffle. This mechanism can realize the anonymity of transactions and the anonymity of all services.
ANTUSDT platform advantages
According to market research, all coin mixers on the market are open to merchants, and ANTUSDT is the only coin mixer that is open to merchants and retail investors.
ANTUSDT's business scope also includes: cryptocurrency collection agenting, payment agenting, coining cash lending, coining currency borrowing, multi-country and multi-platform acceptance, etc.
How does ANTUSDT coin shuffle make profit
Merchants need to use the corresponding currency, retail merchants supply and merchants use, and merchants give corresponding commissions (to ensure that the fund pool has sufficient spare assets to provide and withdraw coins, every coin shuffle requires the user to actively authorize it, only by obtaining the user's authorization can assets can assist in coin shuffle.
Cooperative merchants have paid a deposit equivalent to 25 BTC and a full liquidity deposit of more than 5 times to ensure zero risk in ANTUSDT business.
Introduction of AUTUSDT rules
Ordinary users can earn coin shuffle commissions by participating in two-coin shuffle methods through a single authorization.
ANTUSDT cross-chain coin shuffle
ANTUSDT creates a large-scale coin shuffle pool, which gathers the most circulating currencies on the market.
Join the cross-chain coin shuffle via authorization, their assets will be mixed with hundreds of thousands of cryptocurrencies around the world. Through countless asset interactions, the traces of funds of participating users can be completely concealed to achieve the effect that the ocean can bleach ink.
ANTUSDT has a large number of cooperative merchants. The coin shuffle pool can handle a large number of assets with privacy requirements 24 hours a day, and provide encrypted whereabouts and currency exchange services for assets. Every time ordinary users are authorized to participate in cross-chain coin shuffle, they can obtain the commission earned by the coin shuffle pool.
Reciprocating acceptance coin shuffle
Join reciprocating acceptance coin shuffle via authorization, their assets will be on standby at any time for major merchants to call, during which their assets may switch between various currencies. After applying for the call, the user needs to press the ""Re-exchange"" button in the order on the coin shuffle details page.
Large merchants will restore their assets to the original digital currency within the specified time and pay the corresponding commission.
In the fiat currency world, this problem can be traced back to a real legal case in the 17th century. The conclusion of the case is that-if users receive a banknote involved in theft, the police will later investigate that the banknote was stolen and traded several times before it reaches their hand. In this case, the police have no right to Take this banknote from their account. The same is true for digital currencies. What does it matter if users receive a coin that is not stolen by them?

72357,2024-05-28 09:20:32,Bitcoin price today: Bitcoin dips to $68k with key inflation data ahead this week,"Investing.com -- The price of Bitcoin fell slightly on Tuesday, while a rally in no.2 token Ether cooled, as anticipation over key inflation data this week kept traders largely averse to assets like crypto that are perceived as riskier.
Hype over the approval of exchange-traded funds that directly track Ether also took a back seat while the Securities and Exchange Commission engages with fund managers over their applications to list such products.
Last week, the SEC approved applications from major exchanges to list a spot Ether ETF, triggering a sharp rally in the token and broader crypto markets.
Bitcoin had fallen by 0.5% in the past 24 hours to $68,289.3 by 09:08 ET (13:08 GMT). Ether sank 0.4% to $3,899.26, retreating from two-month highs touched over the weekend.
Fears of higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates remained squarely in focus, especially ahead of the release of the monthlypersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) price indexon Friday.
The reading is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, and is likely to factor into the central bank’s outlook on rates.
Sentiment towards crypto and other risk-driven assets was dented by growing suspicions that the Fed is in no rush to bring rates down from more than two-decade highs. A string of officials from the central bank have recently flagged that they need to see more proof inflation is sustainably cooling toward their 2% target before rolling out any cuts.
The notion has kept Bitcoin comfortably within a trading range established over nearly three months, and has also limited bigger gains in Ether.
High rates bode poorly for speculative assets such as crypto, given that they limit liquidity that can be invested in the space, and also push up the attractiveness of conventional, low-risk investments such as the U.S. dollar and Treasuries.

The 50 day EMA of course has been an area that has been important more than once, and as a result it will be paid close attention to. If we break down below the bottom of the candlestick for the trading session, then we could drop below the 1.18 level, but it is clear that a lot of people are paying close attention to the Federal Reserve and its lack of willingness to raise interest rates.
The next question of course will be whether or not we can turn around a break above the top of the candlestick, because if we do then we will more than likely make another charge towards the 200 day EMA. The markets are going to take a very serious look at whether or not the ECB will do the same as the Fed, or if they will start to dial back bond purchases. Furthermore, there is the German election that looks like it is going to shake everything up, so that is something to keep in mind. When you look at this chart, it shows just how much confusion there is, but if we could somehow get to the upside, it is likely that this thing will take off. In general, I think that you can count on a lot of confusion, but eventually the market would have to make some type of decision.

19908,2020-10-15 13:35:00,Alien Worlds NFTs sell out in first ETH-WAX Dutch auction,"ZUG, Switzerland, Oct. 15, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --via CryptoCurrencyWire--Alien Worlds (alienworlds.io), the NFT DeFi metaverse created by the team that pioneered the decentralized autonomous community (DAC) and tokenized block producer eosDAC, has sold out its inaugural NFT sale in the first-ever Dutch auction on the WAX Blockchain.
Alien Worlds is the only NFT DeFi project cross-denominated on both Ethereum and WAX. Gamers farm the metaversal ERC-20 token, Trilium, using NFT land and tools. NFT cards confer gameplay advantages in mining and fighting, and power is expressed by participants staking the ERC-20 Trilium token to planets, each of which is a DAC with dedicated elected leadership.
The Alien Worlds inaugural Dutch NFT auction concluded on Oct. 10, 2020, and allowed gamers to secure Launch Packs at a range of prices. Launch Packs sold out well in advance of the conclusion of the auction, which was scheduled to run for 24 hours.
Buyers opined on purchasing strategies in the active Alien Worlds Telegram channel during the lively auction and are keenly awaiting the four additional Alien Worlds NFT pack sales that will occur this autumn. Buyers paid the opening Dutch auction prices to secure “first mints,” which are popular among NFT collectors due to their ultra-rarity. As prices moved down through the price range, auction participants were determined to secure Alien Worlds NFT cards with better stats, which make mining and fighting more lucrative within the metaverse and which can later be “shined” for even greater gameplay efficiency.
The upcoming NFT auction schedule will be:
• Oct. 23: Rare Pack Sale – 4,000 packs with greater probabilities of receiving Rare-type cards and some special cards reserved for this sale.
• Nov. 6: Legendary Pack Sale – 3,000 packs with greater probabilities of receiving Legendary-type cards.
• Nov. 20: eosDAC Pack Sale – Sale for eosDAC tokens with bonus probabilities.
• Dec. 4: Special Land Pack Sale – The only chance to obtain Land NFTs.
The auctions take place on theAlien Worlds Sales websiteand offer parallel supply on Ethereum and WAX. NFT holders from Ethereum communities like Decentraland, Gods Unchained, Sandbox, RARI and Axie, as well as the growing WAX-based NFT communities, participate in tandem. Alien Worlds NFTs are available in the upcoming auction series, but the fungible Trilium token can only be obtained in-game through play. Alien Worlds co-founder and blockchain lead Michael Yeates has innovated the first cross-chain Ethereum-WAX methodology, which allows the fungible Trilium token to be recorded and transacted simultaneously across both blockchains.
“The success of Alien Worlds’ first auction tells me our community understands how NFTs complement DeFi so synergistically,” said Alien Worlds co-founder Rob Allen. “People love NFTs because they are digital items you can use in gameplay and collect. People love DeFi because it’s an emerging application of blockchain through which we find sources of potential earnings and arrange those directly with peers. Within Alien Worlds there’s a home for both, because our project relies on both NFTs and the decentralized autonomous community or DAC structure, which allows users to decide how earnings are apportioned.”
Since Ethereum is the home of DeFi and WAX is “the King of NFTs,” Alien Worlds sits at the crossroads of these advances in blockchain by being the first and only cross-denominated project. To strengthen this conjunction, Alien Worlds is reaching out to highly invested Ethereum NFT enthusiasts. The project has dropped Promo Packs of NFTs onto the top 6,400 NFT holders in Decentraland, RARI, Gods Unchained, Sandbox and Axie. Users can check if theymade the cutand claim their Promo Packs via alienworlds.io. Alien Worlds is also seekingETH Ambassadorsto help spread the word.
“We’re excited to see how the community evolves this project, particularly in terms of ‘planets,’” said co-founder Sarojini McKenna. “Users choose where to stake their Trilium, and a planet with more Trilium staked to it will receive more rewards, which that planet can decide how to use – including paying its backers. The fact that each planet is its own DAC makes this truly decentralized, which we know from experience leads to an abundance of energy and creativity; wonderful things you never could have foreseen start happening.”
Alien Worlds is set in a future in which some of Earth’s inhabitants have discovered a way to escape the raging pandemics on Earth through a wormhole revealed to them by an advanced alien race, which sent messages through Bitcoin mining algorithms. To build a fairer economy, everything in the Alien Worlds metaverse was tokenized.
Now, the Alien Worlds “Star Route” or roadmap, published on the project’s website, includes the launch of the beta Unity user interface, the opening of the “shining” functionality in which NFTs can be combined to create rarer items, and the commencement of battling using NFT weapons and minions in the Thunder Dome. Further developments in the metaversal narrative arc, sometimes precipitated by guidance from an Ancient Alien AI, will be ongoing.
About Alien Worlds(alienworlds.io): Alien Worlds is a smart-contract decentralized metaverse combining DeFi farming with NFT card-based strategy play.

94934,2023-11-20 14:00:00,Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Discount Narrows,"The gap between the price of the $23 billionGrayscaleBitcoin Trust (GBTC) and its net asset value narrowed to 11% this week as spot bitcoin ETF hopes reached fever pitch. But GBTC isn’t the only quasi-closed-end cryptocurrency fund seeing its discount drop.
Today, the competing Osprey Bitcoin Trust (OBTC), which has $100 million in assets under management, is only trading 7% below its net asset value, the smallest discount in over a year.
The difference between the price of the $6.1 billion Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and its NAV is now 16%, down from 60% in December, while the gap between the price of the $227 million Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG) and its NAV is now 44%, down from 77% in December.
Meanwhile, the $106 million Grayscale Litecoin Trust (LTCN) and the $70 million Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCHG) are trading withpremiumsof 5% and 2%, respectively, after sporting discounts of around 60% at the start of the year.
Thefast-disappearing discountson these trusts are a reflection of investors’ expectations that the launch of a spot bitcoin ETF is imminent.
A successful ETF conversion would open GBTC up to fund redemptions, instantly bringing its market price in line with its net asset value.
But a potential greenlight forspot bitcoin ETFswould only have a direct impact on GBTC. The ability to arbitrage away the discounts on the other trusts would still be lacking.
Of course, investors probably believe that a spot bitcoin ETF would be followed by spot ETFs tied to other cryptocurrencies.
One can certainly make the case that a spot ether ETF won’t be far behind a spot bitcoin ETF. Ether futures trade on the CME and the SEC recently cleared the way for ETFs tied to those futures contracts. A spot ether ETF isn’t much of a stretch.
What is more of a stretch are ETFs tied to othercryptocurrencies, such as litecoin and bitcoin cash. There are no futures contracts on the CME tied to those cryptocurrencies, so the SEC will likely make the case that these should be treated differently than bitcoin and ether.
It’s hard to imagine a litecoin, bitcoin cash or dogecoin ETF launching anytime soon.
And that’s what makes the price action in LTCN and BCHG ironic. They’ve been acting even better than GBTC and ETHE, even though a conversion of those trusts into ETFs is still farfetched.

38175,2020-04-17 07:52:19,Bitcoin Mining Hardware War Is Heating Up Ahead of the Halving,"Shenzhen-based MicroBT is rolling out three top-of-the-line bitcoin miners amid heated competition with Bitmain ahead of the network’s halving event in less than 30 days.
Chen Jianbing, COO of MicroBT, announced in an online event on Friday that the three new models – the WhatsMiner M30S+, M30S++ and M31S+ – are available via both warehouse inventory and pre-orders that can be delivered in up to 30 days.
The move underscores MicroBT’s neck-and-neckcompetitionin the multi-billion-dollar mining hardware market with major rival Bitmain, which is scheduled to deliver the first batch of its latest AntMiner S19 and S19 Pro miners in May.

At the event, Chen reemphasized MicroBT’s rapid growth in 2019, having achieved sales of 600,000 units of its WhatsMiner M20 series, which, as CoinDeskreportedin February, has chipped away at Bitmain’s longstanding market dominance.
The COO said 2019 sales volume had also doubled compared with 2018, boosting its sold computing power to 35 million terahashes per second (TH/s). That accounted for 35 percent of the Bitcoin network’s total hash rate as of the end of December.
The new models add to MicroBT’s existing M30 product line, which includes the previously launched WhatsMiner M30S and M31S.
With the latest equipment from both major manufacturers soon to start shipping, the bitcoin mining hardware market is now entering what Chen called the “3X era,” referring to a mining efficiency that’s below 40 watts per terahash (W/T).

For context, W/T measures how much electricity a mining machine consumes for each terahash of computing power. Since bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive computing process, a miner with a lower W/T ratio would be able to bring home a higher gross margin.
This metric has become considerably more important given the upcoming bitcoin halving, which will reduce the amount of bitcoin earned by the mining industry in a day from around 1,800 to 900 units.

According to the firm’s specifications, the M30S+ is able to compute at a 100 TH/s with 34 W/T efficiency, while the M30S++ can compute as much as 112 TH/s at 31 W/T. The previously launched M30S is claimed to deliver an efficiency of 38 W/T.
Meanwhile, the M31S+ and the earlier M31S both deliver an efficiency of 42 W/T. However, Chen said the new model has the option to switch to a lower voltage mode in order to improve the efficiency to below 40 W/T.
To put this into perspective, by Bitmain’s specification, AntMiner S19 and S19 Pro machines are said to be able to compute at 95 TH/s and 110 TH/s with an efficiency of 34 W/T and 30 W/T, respectively.
But arguably miner manufacturers are all facing a tough time selling equipment under current market conditions, with mining operations taking a step back to wait and see how bitcoin’s price will play out after halving.
Major manufacturers have had to mark down the prices of their mining equipment followingbitcoin’s price crash on March 12, the largest sell-off since 2013.
Vincent Zhang, MicroBT’s head of sales, said during the launch event the WhatsMiner M30S is now priced at $1,962 – down from around $2,500 when it was initially released. For the new models announced today, the M30S+ and M30S++ are priced at $2,740 and $3,899 per unit, respectively.
Following the recent price cuts, manufacturers such as Bitmain have also had topartially refund customerswho placed pre-orders at the higher price, a policy the firm has had in place for the past several years.
Zhang said MicroBT is now also enforcing such a policy in its bid to keep customers happy. Users who have placed pre-orders at a higher price than the retail value at the time of delivery will be compensated for the difference, like with Bitmain, in cash coupons. These can only be redeemed at up to 10 percent of the value of additional goods purchased by MicroBT.
Although MicroBT gained a large amount of market share in 2019, it had issues delivering devices on the timeline it had promised to customers, suffering up to several months of delays.

Zhang said the firm will now compensate customers in cash coupons worth 0.3 percent of the value of a pre-ordered machine for each day a delivery is delayed beyond the promised date.
Also notably, MicroBT will extend its warranty policy for the M30 series to one year post-delivery – longer than the industry’s average six-month warranty period.

TORONTO, Nov. 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Purpose Investments Inc. (“Purpose”) is happy to announce the launch today of carbon neutral classes for its cryptocurrency funds, Purpose Bitcoin ETF (“BTCC”) and Purpose Ether ETF (“ETHH”). The carbon neutral series of its Bitcoin and Ether ETFs will begin trading today on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the tickers: BTCC.J and ETHH.J, respectively. They are offered as new classes of the existing ETFs and will not impact the existing classes of BTCC and ETHH listed in market.
“We believe in the potential of cryptocurrency, but we can’t ignore the carbon impact of Bitcoin and Ethereum mining. We hope these carbon neutral ETF classes will provide our sustainability-minded investors an opportunity to invest in crypto while addressing the environmental impact this amazing asset can have,” said Som Seif, founder and CEO of Purpose Investments. “We’re extremely proud to offer this innovation and believe it could be the first step toward increased sustainability in the cryptocurrency space, which we care deeply about.”
Purpose launched the world’s first Bitcoin ETF and the world’s first Ether ETF earlier this year to provide investors with convenient ways to hold cryptocurrency in registered accounts without a digital wallet. Now, Purpose has partnered with Patch Technologies Inc. (“Patch”), a leading API-first platform for carbon removal, to give investors the opportunity to sustainably invest in Bitcoin and Ether. Through this partnership, all carbon emissions linked to an investment will be offset to achieve net zero carbon output.
“The crypto community has moved quickly and decisively over the past months to address the industry’s climate impact. Purpose Investments in taking a leading role in this effort,” said Brennan Spellacy, co-founder and CEO of Patch. “We’re proud to support their carbon-neutral crypto ETFs, from measuring their carbon footprint to providing access to high quality carbon offset and removal projects.”
The carbon footprint of investments will be measured daily using Patch’s in-house measurement methodology for both Bitcoin and Ether. Carbon offsets will be purchased on a weekly basis to target net zero carbon emissions at the beginning of each trading week and invested in both traditional and ground-breaking new climate projects around the world that are verified and vetted by Patch.
“We spent a lot of time investigating how we could make cryptocurrency investing more sustainable, which included countless hours of research into the different carbon offsetting programs and providers. We wanted to ensure we found a solution with a practical, fully transparent, and effective approach to carbon offsetting—I’m happy to say we found all this and more in our partnership with Patch. We now have the world’s first dedicated carbon offset purchase option for investors who want to minimize their carbon footprint while investing in cryptocurrency,” says Vlad Tasevski, Chief Operating Officer and Head of Product at Purpose Investments.
“We were one of the first investment firms in the world to embed ESG factors into our core investment processes across our entire investment platform. We are proud of this and care deeply about the potential for crypto, but we want to make sure investors are able to stay true to their values without worrying about their carbon footprint, while still embracing the potential of Bitcoin and Ether,” Seif concluded.

1528,2017-06-23 15:22:00,"John McAfee's latest gambit is mining Ethereum — the cryptocurrency that's up nearly 4,000% this year","(John McAfee.John McAfee)
MGT Capital, the company run by John McAfee, said it would start tomine Ethereum— the bitcoin rival that has surged nearly 4,000% this year — in its latest bid to turn a profit.MGT, which is publicly traded over the counter, has pitched itself to investors mostly as a cybersecurity company. Cybersecurity is where McAfee made his mark as the founder of the antivirus company that bears his name.But McAfee has more recently started to tout cryptocurrencies. He said last month that investments in bitcoin would help put MGTback in the blackby the end of the year.Ethereum is like bitcoin in thatit can be ""mined""by computers that solve complex computations. MGT said Friday that it reached an agreement with Bit5ive LLC to buy up to 60 graphics-processor-based mining computers to help mine for ether.
""We are more convinced each day of the growth and value of digital currencies, and our company is uniquely positioned to be a leading provider of processing power to relevant blockchains,"" McAfee said in the statement.
McAfee's foray into the cryptocurrency space comes when others have been sounding the alarm after a huge run-up in prices.In early June, billionaireMark Cuban said it was evident that bitcoin was a bubble, tweeting, ""When everyone is bragging about how easy they are making $=bubble.""
Days later,Goldman Sachs warned that bitcoin was looking ""heavy""and that a drop to between $2,330 and $1,915 a coin was looking likely. Bitcoin put in a low of $2,076 just a day later after the scaling debate came back into focus as the bitcoin-mining firm Bitmain outlined its ""contingency plan"" for if a hard fork were to occur. Bitcoin has recouped those losses and now trades at $2,708.
Ethereum is up by 3,964% in 2017. As for MGT, its stock is up by 42% year-to-date.

4701,2017-09-29 07:53:07,South Korea Follows China By Banning ICOs,"WhenChina’s central bank banned initial coin offerings (ICOs)at the start of this month, the move helpedtrigger a crash in the value of bitcoin. The cryptocurrency haslargely recovered, but enthusiasts will be on the alert again, as South Korea has now followed China’s lead.
The ICO is a new form of fundraising where, instead of a startup issuing its investors with shares, it gives them digital tokens that are sometimes connected with the new service they’re trying to sell. There are huge risks here, as many of the startups launching ICOs are getting regular people to buy into thin or implausible business plans—or, worse, outrightscamming them with pump-and-dump schemes.
Those risks are what led China to pull the plug, and the same thought seems to have occurred to South Korea’s financial regulators. The country’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) said Friday thatit was banning all ICOsin the country, with a threat of “stern penalties” for those who continue with the fundraising method.
“There is a situation where money has been flooded into an unproductive and speculative direction,” FSC vice chairman Kim Yong-beom said, according toYonhap.
The regulator added that virtual-currency trading needed to be closely monitored and controlled. It’s worth noting that China followed up its ICO ban with a heavily rumored—though never officially confirmed—crackdown on Bitcoin exchanges.
The latest newstriggered a 2% fallin Bitcoin’s value, and a slightly larger drop in the value of Ethereum, the virtual currency that’s used in many ICOs. It remains to be seen how much the Korean ban will affect sentiment in the coming days.
The cryptocurrency community is certainly aware of the risks surrounding ICOs. Ethereum creatorVitalik Buterin earlier this week released a whitepaperhe had co-authored regarding ways to dampen the dangerous hype that sometimes accompanies the offerings.",4109.79,0.48,4090.1,0.0,4120.0,0.73,4116.0,0.64,4090.0
31226,2020-04-03 15:00:00,P2P Exchange Hodl Hodl Takes First Step in Bringing Private Bitcoin Trades to BlueWallet Users,"While the cryptocurrency space has moved well beyond its cypherpunk origins, some platforms are still determined to let users keep their transactions to themselves.
In the works since late 2019,BlueWallet, a non-custodial mobile crypto wallet for iOS and Android, is integrating with Hodl Hodl, a peer-to-peer exchange, to add privatebitcoin(BTC) trades to the app.
Now, the wallet’s users can view available orders on the exchange, but a full integration is coming in “several months,” BlueWallet co-founder Igor Korsakov told CoinDesk. Once complete, BlueWallet users will be able to buy and sell bitcoin directly with other users via the app.

“They have a non-custodial wallet, we have non-custodial trades. Nobody else in the bitcoin space has done this yet,” Hodl Hodl CEO Max Keidun said.
Hodl Hodlis a peer-to-peer exchange that as a matter of principle does not perform know-your-customer (KYC) checks. That’s because the team does not believe providing identification does any good for bitcoiners – on the contrary, it makes their personal data subject to potential hacks and leaks, the founders said.
“We chose Hodl Hodl because it’s the only peer-to-peer marketplace that isn’t doing KYC and isn’t going to,” BlueWallet’s Korsakov said. “This will be very important in the coming battle for privacy in bitcoin.”
That “battle” is between the proponents of pseudonymous, private transactions and the more numerous pro-KYC/anti-money laundering (AML) companies choosing to comply with requirements from global financial watchdogssuch as the Financial Action Task Force. BlueWallet places itself firmly in the first group.

“In 2020, this battle will be in full swing, as the regulators are pressing more and more, and exchanges are easily handing over their users’ data, introducing KYC, working with blockchain analytics firms and rejecting the coins from suspicious transactions,” Korsakov said. This hurts the fungibility of bitcoin and destroys the presumption of innocence for users, he believes.
“We’re not going to do any surveillance,” Keidun agreed. “Plus, virtually any coins could touch the dark web marketplaces at some point.”

Hodl Hodl is serving about 25,000 users globally at the moment, according to Keidun. The marketplace has recentlyjoineda number of other exchanges using the Liquid sidechain byBlockstreamfor faster transactions.
To trade bitcoin on Hodl Hodl, a user needs to find a counterparty and create a two-out-of-three multi-signature escrow (that gives a key each for both parties in the trade, with a third held by the exchange).
The seller locks bitcoin in the escrow and releases it once they see the buyer has sent a fiat currency payment via an agreed method. In case of a conflict, Hodl Hodl can the third key to resolve the dispute and release the funds either way.
“As we don’t store users’ funds, creating a standalone mobile app would be nonsense. As in this case, we would have to create a wallet as well and take care of the funds. So we chose to integrate with already existing wallets,” Keidun said. Hodl Hodl is in talks with other wallets as well, he said, but could not disclose any names.

Building the multisig escrow for a mobile interface is no easy task, Korsakov conceded. At this point, the team is working on making the system user friendly so that “not just geeks” can understand it.

86014,2024-07-25 09:35:13,Bitstamp will return cryptocurrency assets to creditors of Mt. Gox,"The world's oldest cryptocurrency exchange, Bitstamp, is beginning the process of giving back seized digital assets to creditors of Mt. Gox.
Bitstamp received Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Ethereum (ETH) from the Mt. Gox trustees, which will be distributed to Bitstamp users starting 25 July.
After security procedures are completed, recipients will have complete ownership of their assets within a week of delivery.
UK consumers should anticipate receiving their restored during the next few months, even though they will not be part of the first tranche of payments. Further details will be provided as they become available.
Those impacted by the 2014 hacking operation had been waiting for compensation for ten years, but many will now realise significant earnings once a protracted bankruptcy process is over.
When Mt. Gox crashed, the value of one bitcoin was approximately $600. As of right now, it is trading at about £51,600 / $66,800 per coin.
With an emphasis on security and compliance, Bitstamp is one of the most regulated exchanges, holding over 50 licenses and registrations globally.
Moreover, as part of the restoration procedure, nearly 20,000 former Mt. Gox users will get more than $9bn in Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, and Ethereum. Mt. Gox creditors who used Bitstamp as their exchange will get their restored assets in their Bitstamp accounts.
Jean-Baptiste Graftieaux, global chief executive officer at Bitstamp, stated: “As the world’s longest-running crypto exchange, and one of the most trusted, we’re proud to play our part in making the Mt Gox investors whole. It’s a testament to Bitcoin’s value as an asset that, although the Mt Gox investors should never have been unable to access their tokens, many will make a serious profit.
“Nonetheless, the whole situation confirms the absolute importance of choosing an exchange that prioritises security and compliance above everything else. Investing in cryptocurrency carries risk, but savvy investors can still stand to make considerable gains.”
From 2010 until 2014, the bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox was situated in Tokyo.
At one point, it was the only exchange older than Bitstamp and handled over 70% of all Bitcoin transactions. The exchange claimed to have discovered suspicious behaviour in its digital wallets in February 2014, at which point it banned withdrawals. The exchange filed for bankruptcy soon after.

Hackers attacked BNB Chain's Four.meme launch platform, exploiting new meme tokens to drain liquidity by bypassing listing restrictions and creating unauthorized trading pairs on PancakeSwap, siphoning off funds around 04:00 GMT.
The attack preempted Four.meme’s curated token launches, buying small token amounts pre-launch, adding liquidity to PancakeSwap pairs, and rug-pulling them, targeting popular tokens like MubaraKing (87.90 BNB stolen) and others such as EDDY and Cocoro.
Four.meme suspended new token launches and promised compensation for affected users, though no smart contract vulnerability was found. Leaked early transactions enabled the hacker’s front-running, according to analyst Chaofan Shou.
The attack exploited a flawed token function allowing transfers during the bonding curve stage, a recurring flow cell manipulation issue, potentially affecting all Four.meme tokens despite only a few being hit due to their popularity.

16000,2019-02-24 03:32:29,"Bitcoin Cash – ABC, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 24/02/19","Bitcoin Cash ABC rallied by 8.06% on Saturday. Following on from a 0.43% rise from Friday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $152.62.
A range-bound first half of the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall to a morning low $139.8. The day’s first major support level at $139.12 was left untested, The pullback came ahead of a broad-based cryptomarket rally.
Bitcoin Cash ABC rallied through the day’s major resistance levels and 38.2% FIB of $148 to strike a late in the day intraday high $152.6.
The breakout through to $150 levels began the formation of a near-term bullish trend from late January’s swing lo $105.00.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 2.15% to $155.90. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $152.5 to a morning high and new swing hi $155.90. The day’s major support and resistance levels were left untested early on.
For the day ahead, a breakthrough to $156 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $156.89 into play. Support from the broader market could see Bitcoin Cash ABC breakout from $156 levels to bring $160 levels into play before any pullback.
Barring another crypto-rally, we would expect Bitcoin Cash ABC to come up short of the second major resistance level at $161.17.
Failure to break through to $156 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC pullback through to $152 levels in the early part of the week. Holding onto $150 levels would be needed to avoid a slide through $148 levels. A fall through $148 would bring the first major support level at $144.07 into play.
Litecoin rose by 4.32% on Saturday. Following on from a 1.24% gain from Friday, Litecoin ended the day at $51.19.
A bearish start to the day saw Litecoin fall to a late morning intraday low $48.02 before steadying. The pullback saw Litecoin call on support at the first major support level at $48.11.
Tracking the broader market through the afternoon, Litecoin rallied to a late intraday high $51.73 before easing back. The move saw Litecoin break through the first major resistance level at $49.87 and second major resistance level at $50.43.
At the time of writing, Litecoin was up by 2.32% to $52.38. A bullish start to the day saw Litecoin rise from a morning low $51.17 to a morning high $52.61 before easing back. The early move saw Litecoin come up against the first major resistance level at $52.61. Litecoin left Support levels untested early on in the day.
For the day ahead, a hold onto $52 levels through the morning would support a break back through the first major resistance level. Support from the broader market would bring $53 levels and the second major resistance level at $54.02 into play.
Failure to hold onto $52 levels could see Litecoin give up the morning gains. A fall through to $50 levels would be needed, however, to bring sub-$50 levels and the first major support level at $48.90 into play.
Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, we would expect Litecoin to steer clear of sub-$50 levels on the day.
Ripple’s XRP rose by 3.61% on Saturday. Following on from a 0.55% gain from Friday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.34046.
A relatively bearish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP fall to a mid-morning intraday low $0.32402 before finding support.
Steering clear of the day’s first major support level at $0.3220, rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $0.34291. Ripple’s XRP broke through the first major resistance level at $0.3330 and second major resistance level at $0.3375. More notably, Ripple’s XRP held onto $0.34 levels for the first time since 9thJanuary.
At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up by 2.21% to $0.3480. Tracking the broader market, Ripple’s XRP rallied from a morning low $0.33967 to a morning high $0.35178 before easing back. The early rally saw Ripple’s XRP breakthrough the first major resistance level at $0.3476.
For the day ahead, a move back through to $0.35 levels would support another run at the second major resistance level at $0.3547. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, we would expect Ripple’s XRP to struggle to break out from $0.355 levels on the day.
Failure to move back through to $0.35 levels could see Ripple’s XRP pullback through to $0.33 levels before any recovery.
Barring a broad-based crypto reversal, we would expect Ripple’s XRP to steer clear of $0.32 levels and the first major support level at $0.3287.

This is the latest in a series of jurisdictions topauseorslow downthe approval of new crypto mining operations, driven by the worry that the miners' load might adversely affect local communities.
""We can't simply say, 'Well, anyone can take whatever [energy] they want to take and we'll simply build dams',"" Finance Minister Cameron Friesen, the minister responsible for the province's utility Manitoba Hydro, said on Monday, according to reports byCBCandCTV News Winnipeg.
The government will stop new crypto mining operations from connecting to the grid for 18 months. However, the existing 37 mining facilities will not be affected.
Neither the Finance Minister nor Manitoba Hydro responded to requests for comment at the time of publication.
Miners have flocked to Canada for its cheap electricity, with Manitoba having the second-cheapest electricity rates in the country after Quebec, according to reports.
An additional 17 miners have requested to connect to the grid, and their energy demand would total 371 megawatts (MW), the minister said. That 371 MW is roughly half the generating capacity of theKeeyask generating station, which went into full operation earlier this year.
Manitoba Hydro's debt has tripled in the last 15 years as it took on loans to built two new mega projects totaling CAD3.7 billion (US$2.75 billion), Keeyask and the Bipole III transmission line. About 40% of consumers' utility fees go to servicing debt,according to Manitoba Hydro.
Less formal inquiries total 4.6 gigawatts (GW) of power, according to Friesen.

61442,2021-06-07 20:20:04,Top White House tech critic Tim Wu holds more than $1M in Bitcoin,"Tim Wu, a top antitrust expert at the White House, is a Bitcoin millionaire, according to a personal financial disclosure he recently filed. Wu, a tough critic of tech companies’ power, owns between $1 million and $5 million in Bitcoin, as well as between $100,001 and $250,000 in Filecoin, which is a storage platform for cryptocurrency, according to the disclosure. His investment in Bitcoin is his largest holding in his financial portfolio. Wu joined the Biden administration in March as special assistant for technology and competition policy to the president at the National Economic Council. While Wu will not have any involvement in developing policies about cryptocurrency in that role, the disclosures show that one of Big Tech’s most prominent critics is also invested in an asset class that is a major tech world obsession. Wu hasn’t always been a fan of Bitcoin. In 2017, he called it a “bubble” and posed the question “is it really worth anything at all?” “Bitcoin isn’t backed by any sovereign, and unlike a stock or a bond, it gives you a claim to nothing other than Bitcoin itself,” he wrote, although he added that that “illusory quality” describes most forms of money. While he cast doubt on the practical value of consumers using Bitcoin to pay for everyday purchases because of its large price swings, he did say the cryptocurrency “might work fine as a store of value that you can sell.” He also said Bitcoin reflected a trend of social trust moving away from human institutions to systems based on code. Wu, who coined the term “net neutrality” and served in the Obama administration, declined to comment for this story. A White House official said in a statement that “Tim is recused from any particular matters involving bitcoin or cryptocurrency generally because of his financial interest, and has not worked on any such matters.” The official requested anonymity to discuss personnel matters. Wu went on leave from his position as a law professor at Columbia University to join the Biden administration. At Columbia, he made $617,500 over the 16 months before he joined the White House. Story continues Based on Bitcoin’s current price of about $34,000, Wu holds between 29 and 146 actual Bitcoins. Bitcoin is off more than 40 percent from the height of its value, but has done relatively well in 2021, up around 20 percent so far this year. Overall, Wu is worth between nearly $4 million and $11.5 million, with much of the rest of his money tied up in Vanguard mutual funds. The Bitcoin investment constitutes between 25 and 43 percent of his assets. Wu’s disclosure reveals that his other investments include condos in Washington, D.C., and Buenos Aires, Argentina that he owns with his wife and between $15,001 and $50,000 in gold bars. It also shows he received income from payments for articles, speeches and book royalties. Those payments include $24,800 last year as a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, earning $1,550 per article, as well as $12,285 doing the same thing for Medium (roughly $650 per piece). He also has made $15,400 doing speeches, including for the Tommy G. Thompson Center on Public Leadership and the University of Hawaii. Wu, who has written four books including “The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age” and “The Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside Our Heads,” also made between $75,205 and $181,000 in book royalties. The financial disclosure was provided to POLITICO by the Brown Institute for Media Innovation at Columbia University, which requested the document from the White House.",35468.78,-0.05,35492.28,0.02,34371.99,-3.14,34054.47,-4.03,35486.34
18637,2018-02-12 23:02:49,"Why MercadoLibre, Inc. Stock Popped 23% in January","Shares ofMercadoLibre Inc.(NASDAQ: MELI)climbed 23% in January, according to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence, as multiple analysts offered encouraging notes on the Latin American e-commerce giant.
No less than three Wall Street firms weighed in on MercadoLibre's prospects last month, starting with reinstated coverage and a hold rating from Deutsche Bank on Jan. 4. At the time, analyst Masha Kahn lauded MercadoLibre's history of innovation, customer focus, and proven ability to generate value for shareholders. Furthermore, Kahn noted the company is poised to benefit from ""a large addressable market opportunity [...] in both e-commerce and online payments in Latin America.""
Image source: Getty Images.
But Kahn also cautioned that competition is on the rise, and worried that MercadoLibre's valuation at the time left little room for execution errors. To be sure, MercadoLibre stock doubled in 2017, including amore-than-30% popin the final two months of the year following its stellar third-quarter report in early November.
Less than a week later, however, Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju continued to spur MercadoLibre higher by reiterating his outperform rating and increasing his per-share price target from $380 to $385 (shares trade at roughly $354 as of this writing). To justify his increased optimism, Ju cited a higher-than-expected unit volume growth forecast in Brazil, particularly as MercadoLibre's investments in free shipping subsidies enable it to take market share from competitors.
Then later in the month, Stifel's Scott Devitt followed by maintaining his buy rating and raising his per-share price target to $415 from $350. Devitt largely echoed Ju's sentiment, speculating that MercadoLibre enjoyed continued strong sales momentum in both Brazil and Mexico through the holidays thanks to its shipping, customer loyalty, and marketing initiatives.
Time will tell whether Wall Street's optimism is merited; investors will receive their next update to that end when MercadoLibre announces fourth-quarter 2017 results late next week. But in the meantime, it was no surprise to see the stock continuing to soar last month.

199,2013-12-06 13:24:00,PRESENTING: The Most Powerful Bitcoin Miner In The World,"Rob Wile/Business Insider
Mining a Bitcoin, which involves directing large amounts of computing power at solving complex equations, doesn't come cheap.
Werecently told youabout the gonzo sales Stockholm-basedKnCMinersaw on Black Friday for its Neptune device, set to be the most powerful Bitcoin mining device in the world when it's released.
It won't be available until next year, and you won't be able to get it right away unless you're a pre-existing KnC customer. And it will cost $13,000.
We got our hands on the next best thing: KnC's Jupiter miner, currently the world's most powerful. You actually can't purchase one of these now either — KnC has promised all customers who bought before August that it wouldn't sell anymore so as not to disrupt the Bitcoin mining difficulty rate. Bitcoin is designed so that the more people mining, the more power is required to mine a single Bitcoin.
But yesterday, Alex Lawn, KnC's English head of technical communications, stopped by our offices to demonstrate a Jupiter model.
Check it out:
Lawn carried around the miner in this box, which helped land him an hour's audience with JFK customs officials.
Rob Wile/Business Insider
Lawn removed the casing right away so we could check out the inside. The casing isn't much to look at anyway, although you can get a sense from the branding that KnC,which started out as a corporate IT shop, is not some fly-by-night operation.
Rob Wile/Business Insider
And here's what he wanted us to see: four circuit boards with fans stacked on top. Don't laugh: It took four-and-a-half months and more than $3.5 million dollars to build.
Rob Wile/Business Insider
Right now, at the current rate of mining difficulty, one of these babies can print one Bitcoin in three days. By comparison, it now takes the average miner about two months to do so. (We weren't really able to mine any because we weren't mining for long enough.)
Rob Wile/Business Insider
The real star of the show actually fits in the palm of your hand: a 28 nanometer application-specific integrated circuit. These are usuallyfound in the iPhone 5s. Now they're used to power printing presses.
Rob Wile/Business Insider
The key to the 28 nm ship is its power efficiency: It uses 40% less power than a 40g computer. However they do still eat up a lot of electricity — this machine alone would add $4 a day to your electric bill — which is why you need the fans blasting.
Rob Wile/Business Insider
Here's what you would see on your mining monitor if you actually had one up and running for real. It shows how well your machine is performing ((avg. hash rate""), and the current mining difficulty rate.
Alex Lawn/KnCMiner
And this is what you'll see when the miner is operating — ""accepted"" means it's solved one of the complex equations:
Alex Lawn/KnCMiner
Lawn would not reveal how many Jupiters they've sold, only to say that each of their batches have sold out, and that individuals in 120 different nations, including Swaziland, have purchased a unit.
Rob Wile/Business Insider
Again, their is a commitment to branding: the company's motto is, ""The whole world, only one block apart"" — referring the ""blocks"" of Bitcoin the miners must unlock.
Rob Wile/Business Insider
At $5,000, these don't come cheap — though you'd only be able to get your hands on one second hand anyway. Things move fast in Bitcoinland.

ASIC -based cryptocurrency mining hardware solutions are used to process and record the transaction of cryptocurrencies efficiently and are built to solve a single hash algorithm. For instance, a Bitcoin mining ASIC -based hardware solution can only mine Bitcoin . Though customization restricts the use of ASIC -based hardware solutions to specific cryptocurrencies , it makes the process of mining cryptocurrency quicker. For instance, a dedicated ASIC -based Bitcoin mining hardware solution can process hashes 100,000 times faster than a high-end general-purpose processor, and it is also several times faster than customized cryptocurrency mining GPUs. The growth of this segment is mainly attributed to the rising adoption of the Cryptocurrency Mining Hardware Market by residential consumers, which is driven by an increase in the global demand for the cryptocurrency mining hardware industry.

Cryptocurrency Mining Hardware Market - Market Dynamics Key driver The profitability of cryptocurrency mining ventures is a major factor driving the global cryptocurrency mining hardware market growth. For every successful transaction, cryptocurrency miners earn a small profit in cryptocurrency based on the quantity of work, which comprises the processing power used by the mining hardware. Mining cryptocurrency is a slow and cumbersome process and not profitable on a small scale. Thus, to increase the profits of their ventures, cryptocurrency miners set up large-scale dedicated rigs. The adoption of cloud cryptocurrency mining is increasing. Moreover, in cloud cryptocurrency mining, customers invest in a cloud-hosted cryptocurrency mining venture, which shares a certain percentage of the earned cryptocurrency with its customers. The cloud-hosted cryptocurrency mining venture uses the investment to enhance the process of mining by buying CPU power from a data center that uses its own equipment to mine cryptocurrency . Therefore, the profitability of cryptocurrency mining ventures will lead to the entry of several small-scale cryptocurrency mining operators that will adopt cloud mining, which will fuel the growth of the market growth during the forecast period. Major Trend The acceptance of cryptocurrency by retailers is an emerging trend shaping the cryptocurrency mining hardware market growth. The primary factor is the acceptance of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether has increased daily transactions among the public, retailers, and merchandisers. Also, the growing use of cryptocurrencies by significant retailers will enhance public perception and the use of cryptocurrencies for financial transactions. Cryptocurrencies have been used to purchase vehicles and order food and groceries in the past. Currently, companies are accepting cryptocurrency payments only in partnership with third-party exchanges such as iPayYou, which handle the cryptocurrency -to-cash conversion. For instance, bitcoin value grows at a more rapid rate than that of inflation and enables enterprises to have adequate savings for unprecedented events. Therefore, for small businesses and retailers alike, it is crucial that they should accept cryptocurrency as an alternative form of payment. Thereby, such factors will drive the market growth during the forecast period. Significant Challenge The volatility in the value of cryptocurrency is a major challenge impeding the cryptocurrency mining hardware market growth. The value of cryptocurrency is extremely volatile. Consequently, low-risk investors do not include cryptocurrency in their financial portfolios. Due to the significant share of cryptocurrency held by a few number of people who buy and sell high volumes on trading platforms and trade exchanges, there is volatility in the value. Other factors, such as lack of transaction charges, position charges, trade posting fees, and regulations on trading platforms, also cause fluctuations \in the value of cryptocurrency . Therefore, people who hold a major share of cryptocurrency influence the value to grow their profits without making any actual investments. Hence, several investors have refrained from including cryptocurrency in their financial portfolios, which is expected to hinder market growth during the forecast period.

Dubbed Metal VC, the $1 million dollar fund will focus on micro and angel investments, primarily in early-stage companies involved in banking and decentralized finance. The fund will allow the startup to align with partners as it expands globally, according to Metal CEO Hayner.
The Metal subsidiary closed its first deal last month, with an undisclosed stake in the Binance-backed startup Yellow Card, which provides a cash-to-crypto on-ramp for emerging markets.

A week after the deal, Finman told CoinDesk he may be close to closing on another startup. This time, an app created by a YouTuber to compete against the video hosting giant that features an in-app currency that could be converted into crypto.
“With Metal VC, our vision is simple, if we see something we like and believe in, we will invest and send MTL Coin right then and there,” Hayner said, adding:
“We view each investment as a partner to Metal.”
Though the amount of time spent advising each firm will vary, Metal is willing to contribute resources including developers or admins depending on a startup’s needs, according to Finman.

The fund is looking to invest seed funding in anywhere between 25 to 100 startups at various stages of development. With an eye towards leading the round “when we can,” Finman said. Metal VC will stake anywhere between a minimum of $25,000 and a maximum of $250,000 in each project.
The fund is self-funded by Finman and Hayner, without outside contributions.
As “the VC fund for misfits,” Finman said he and Hayner are considering company metrics that traditional investment funds may ignore, such as an engaged Discord channel. A founder’s personal quirks also play to Finman’s ear, citing the “super young” and ambitious, or leaders of hacking collectives. Said Finman:
“The more of a misfit, the better job you can have in pitching me.”

Good morning, and welcome to First Mover.I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.
• Price point:Bitcoin trades flat and Polygon's MATIC surges 25%. We take a look at why MATIC is outperforming BTC.
• Market moves:A dive into how Fed Chair Powell was challenged by senators on Wednesday on inflation and crypto regulation.
Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading flat over the last 24 hours, currently around $20,500. Altcoins outperformed BTC overnight, with MATIC, ATOM and AVAX all gaining ground.
Polygon’s MATIC rallied 25% on the day after a series of announcements and product launches. On Wednesday, Polygonannouncedthe launch of Polygon ID integration. Polygon ID is a self-sovereign identity solution powered byZK cryptographythat brings huge potential forDAOgovernance, according to the company.
Polygon, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, has also recently claimed to have obtained a major carbon neutrality (a balance between emitting and absorbing carbon) milestone, which could be contributing to the price uptick. Polygonannouncedearlier this week that it had partnered with KlimaDAO (a decentralized collective of environmentalists, developers and entrepreneurs) as part of its environmental initiative.
Polygon’s MATIC has been trading in an upward trajectory over the past seven days.
Some analysts are also attributing MATIC’s recent rally to a few weeks of whale accumulation. Santiment, the on-chain data provider,tweetedthat sharks and whales holding MATIC have been in a large accumulation trend for the last six weeks.
“The tiers of holders ranging from 10K to 10M coins held have collectively added 8.7% more to their bags in this time span,” tweeted Sanitment.
Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk that the rallies for MATIC, ATOM and AVAX are being held up on low volume.
“Because of this we would expect that any decent drop in equities will lead to a sell-off in alts,” said Dibb.
He also noted that bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), or how much of the total market cap of crypto is comprised of bitcoin, has dropped considerably in the past few days from its high at +48%.
Dibb explained that this is because there has been relative strength in ether as well as litecoin versus bitcoin that has led to BTC dominance losing some ground.
“Our expectation is that should a further sell-off occur, we will see BTC.D continue to head north to short term highs,” added Dibb. “We see this as a temporary situation.""

Fed Chair Powell Says Soft Landing Will Be 'Challenging,' Calls for Crypto Regulation
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that the U.S. central bank must ""go ahead"" and keep raising interest rates to get inflation down, even if that means that the economy faces higher unemployment and a potential recession.
During a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday, Powell said that a soft landing “is going to be very challenging,” and that a recession is “certainly a possibility.” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) called Powell the “most powerful man” in the world right now.
Three senators, including Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), challenged Powell with questions on crypto, specifically regulation, accounting treatment of digital assets and the current crash in the crypto market.
“We are tracking those events very carefully,” said Powell, but the central bank is “not really seeing significant macroeconomic implications, so far.""
He also repeatedly highlighted that there’s a need for a better regulatory framework for crypto.

6343,2018-12-30 01:45:48,E-mini S&P 500 Index (ES) Futures Technical Analysis – Renewed Pressure Could Drive Market into 2419.75 to 2395.50,"March E-mini S&P 500 Index futures finished lower on Friday on late session profit-taking ahead of the week-end, Monday’s holiday shortened session and Tuesday’s bank holiday. Heightened volatility continued to be the highlight of the session. There were no changes in the fundamentals so all of the price action was likely fueled by technical factors and value investors responding to grossly oversold conditions.
On Friday,March E-mini S&P 500 Indexfutures settled at 2486.00, down 9.00 or -0.36%.
The main trend is down according to the daily swing chart. However, momentum has been trending higher since the formation of the closing price reversal bottom on December26 and the subsequent confirmation the next session.
The main trend will change to up on a trade through 2690.50. A move through 2316.75 will negate the closing price reversal bottom and signal a resumption of the downtrend.
From the top down, the main range is 2819.00 to 2316.75. Its retracement zone at 2568.00 to 2627.25 is the primary upside target.
The intermediate range is 2690.50 to 2316.75. Its retracement zone at 2503.75 to 2547.75 provided resistance on Friday.
The short-term range is 2316.75 to 2523.00. Its retracement zone at 2419.75 to 2395.50 is the primary downside target.
Based on Friday’s price action, the direction of the March E-mini S&P 500 Index on Monday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the 50% level at 2503.75.
A sustained move over 2503.75 will indicate the presence of buyers. The first target is Friday’s high at 2523.00. Taking out this level will indicate the buying is getting stronger with the next target the Fibonacci level at 2547.75, followed closely by the main 50% level at 2568.00.
Since the main trend is down, any rally is likely to be labored. So look for fresh selling pressure to come in on a test of each retracement level.
A sustained move under 2503.75 will signal the presence of sellers. The daily chart is wide open under this level so don’t be surprised by an acceleration to the downside. If sellers come in hard then look for a possible break into the short-term retracement zone at 2419.75 to 2395.50.

61733,2021-09-20 15:49:51,Natural Gas Price Fundamental Daily Forecast – Weaker on Forecasts Calling for Lower Cooling Demand,"Natural gas futures are edging higher at the mid-session after clawing back earlier losses. The market was under pressure on the opening after weather-driven demand eased over the weekend. Bespoke Weather Services reported declines in both projected cooling degree days (CDD) and heating degree days (HDD).
At 15:22 GMT,December natural gas futuresare trading $5.297, up $0.039 or +0.74%.
Natural Gas Intelligence (NGI) reported that liquefied natural gas (LNG) feed gas flows were down 0.5 Bcf/d early Monday amid planned maintenance at the Cove Point LNG facility in Maryland, analysts at EBW Analytics Group said.
According to NatGasWeather for September 20-26, “A weather system with showers and thunderstorms will exit the Northwest and track across the Midwest/Great Lakes mid-week, then stall over the Ohio/Valley and East late in the week. Highs with this system will be mild to nice with highs of 60s to 70s, locally upper-50s.
The nation’s strongest demand will be from California to Texas as high pressure brings hot highs of 90s to near 100F. National demand will drop to very light levels late this week and next weekend as highs of upper 60s to 80s rules most of the U.S. and with very little coverage of 90s. Overall, national demand will be moderate Monday, then low-very low after.”
Thursday’s U.S. Energy Information Administration storage report is expected to come in slightly above historical norms. NGI’s model is calling for an 82 Bcf injection into natural gas stocks for the week-ended September 17.
Last year, the EIA recorded a 70 Bcf injection for the similar week, and the five-year average injection is 74 Bcf.
The daily chart indicates December natural gas futures are getting close to shifting momentum to the downside. We expect to see one more rally to test the resistance at $5.79. Our first objective is $5.434.
If sellers come in at $5.434 then look for new pressure to drive the market into at least $4.867 to $4.649.
“Weather-driven demand for natural gas could slip as cooling demand halves by Thursday, however, while shut-in Gulf of Mexico supply trickles back and technical analysis suggests deeper tests of support,” the EBW team said. “Continued price weakness may be likely later this week.”
Bespoke Weather Services added, “At some point, one would think our prices here in the U.S. can move according to changes in fundamentals and soon enough, changes in weather forecasts.”

9242,2017-12-10 13:45:01,Deutsche Bank warns a 'bitcoin crash’ is among the market's most significant 2018 risks,"Could the market's new darling become its next black swan event ? The bitcoin (Exchange: BTC=) craze could pose a real risk to the broader market next year, Deutsche Bank warned last week, ahead of the cryptocurrency's launch on futures exchanges, scheduled to take place Sunday. Torsten Slok, the firm's chief international economist, sent to clients a list of significant risks to the market in 2018. Included on that list: A crash in the price of bitcoin, higher inflation and the threat of North Korea. Bitcoin has emerged as a financial phenomenon this year as the digital currency sees $1,000-plus swings within hours. At this juncture, as the cryptocurrency has advanced quadruple digits this year, Slok said the markets have not correctly priced in the broader impact bitcoin could potentially have. Deutsche Bank's risks to the market in 2018 ""It is something that I think financial markets so far have been discounting as a small issue,"" the economist said Thursday on CNBC's "" Trading Nation ."" He said he worries about whether bitcoin and its wild price swings could become ""more systemic"" next year if the current trends continue. ""The worry, of course, that one can have is that it's catching on quite substantially. And of course with the speed with which prices are going up, then you do wonder where prices will be even by the end of 2017. But we do think that in 2018, this, of course, will continue to be a topic, and there are a number of questions that remain unanswered,"" Slok said. While bitcoin has more than its share of true believers — many of whom have sent its price on a dizzying rally to around $19,000 just last week — the digital currency's volatility and lack of transparency has earned it a fair number of critics. Last week, ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer likened bitcoin trading to ""an abstruse casino game that seems to have only winners and no losers. You've got to like that, right? I think, though, that could change,"" Cramer said. Specifically, questions persist around regulation of the cryptocurrency and transparency in what exactly investors hold, according to Deutsche's Slok.

Created in December 2013, Dogecoin has been a crowd favourite among the cryptocurrency space. The likes of Tesla CEO Elon Musk even gave it praise on social media earlier this year. The listing by Binance sparked a 32% rally in the price of Dogecoin, which currently has a market cap of $512 million. Binance issued an update to say DOGE trading pairs will be made available to customers at 12:00pm UTC on Friday, July 5.

Itâ€™s pretty cool.” The tweet gained more than 10,000 replies, likes, and retweets. The overwhelming response prompted Musk to change his Twitter profile to state he was the “CEO of Dogecoin” in a frankly bizarre turn of events.

72484,2024-05-28 13:38:11,Trump and the Libertarian case for crypto,"There's nothing surprising about a presidential nominee addressing a party convention ahead of an election—unless, that is, the party is not the one they're leading. That's why it was curious to read of former President Donald Trump, the current head of the GOP ticket, addressing the Libertarian party convention on Saturday.
Trump did not exactly win over the crowd, which booed him repeatedly. Still, the appearance was a shrewd political move since, as Trump himself noted, the Libertarian party regularly pulls in 3% on Election Day, and winning over even a few of those voters could make the difference. Trump also used the event to tout his recent conversion to crypto,tellingthe crowd he would ""keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your Bitcoin"" and promising to commute the sentence of drug kingpin Ross Ulbricht (a.k.a.Dread Pirate Roberts) on his first day in office.
These remarks reportedly elicited loud cheers, which is not surprising given that libertarians have supported crypto since day one. This includes theFree State crowdthat helped make New Hampshire an early hotbed of Bitcoin, and Erik Voorhees, the radical libertarian who built the influential OG crypto projects Satoshi Dice and ShapeShift.
The libertarian view—as best as I can make it out—is that the government has no business in any part of our lives, aside from national defense, and that society should be organized entirely around private contracts and the free market. It's a compelling idea. After all, many of us would like to live our lives with less meddling from government-backed factions of the progressive left and the religious right. Alas, the libertarian vision also feels unworkable in this day and age. Do we really want to leave things like highways, schools, policing, and pollution entirely to the market? Ditto with crypto.
It's neat in theory to imagine a world where anyone can mint and circulate their own currency. But the reality is the government has a legitimate interest in preserving the supremacy of the U.S. dollar. History teaches us it rarely ends well when a country's leaders can no longer control its money supply. In this context, Trump's recent words should be viewed as simple political pandering rather than a decision to go full-metal libertarian on crypto or anything else.
I look forward to hearing about more of this at Consensus in Austin, where I'll be interviewing Tom Farley, former NYSE president and current Bullish CEO. The annual crypto confab will also feature a keynote speech from Voorhees, and apolitical debatebetween Trump convert Ryan Selkis and Uniswap's top lawyer—and staunch Democrat—Marvin Ammori. If you're on the ground, come say hello.

In late hours, Tesla Inc. soared as the electric-vehicle giant said it will accelerate the launch of more-affordable models — and chief Elon Musk struck an upbeat tone. The stock halted a seven-day plunge that drove it to “oversold” levels, climbing alongside other members of the “Magnificent Seven” cohort of megacaps on Tuesday. Texas Instruments Inc. gave a bullish revenue forecast — a good sign for the chip industry.
Tesla Stock Soars on ‘Not as Bad as Feared’ Results: Street Wrap
After notching several record highs this year, equities lost traction in the past few weeks amid signals the Federal Reserve will hold rates higher for longer. The slide made stocks more attractive as it removed market froth, with investors now focused on earnings, according to Citigroup Inc. strategists.
“We would view the recent pullback as a buying opportunity,” Citi’s Mihir Tirodkar and Beata Manthey said. “Bullish positioning has unwound and now looks more neutral, particularly in the US. The current earnings season could refocus investor attention on solid underlying fundamentals.”
The S&P 500 notched its best back-to-back rally in two months. Nvidia Corp., the poster child of the artificial-intelligence boom, led a surge in chipmakers. United Parcel Service Inc. — an economic barometer — reported profit that beat estimates. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. closed at an all-time high.
Treasuries briefly extended gains after a solid $69 billion sale of two-year notes — but quickly returned to levels seen ahead of the auction — with 10-year yields little changed.
Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson said the bar is high for US firms to deliver on earnings, particularly for megacap technology names, which face tough comparisons from the growth they showed last year.
But more interesting to him will be how shares react to the results.
Equities extended a rebound after a selloff that sent the S&P 500 down over 5% in April through Friday.
The most-important aspect of the market set-up heading into this week’s earnings was its “oversold” condition, according to Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott.
“Thus, if earnings come in strong over the days ahead, stocks are effectively spring-loaded for a bigger counter-trend rally than we have seen thus far,” he said.
Based on the median and average pullbacks, downside from current levels would be limited to somewhere between 2% to 5% — which would also correspond to S&P 500 levels where there’s strong technical support, said Keith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services.
“Pullbacks are the admission price to the market,” he noted. “The weight of the evidence in our work suggests the market’s risk/reward has improved following the recent setback. Therefore, we view the recent pullback as an opportunity for those investors who have excess cash or are underweight equities relative to their target allocations.”
Ahead of a busy period of quarterly earnings, Bank of America Corp.’s corporate clients stepped up purchases of their own stock.
Buybacks accelerated in the five-day period through April 19 — and are tracking above typical seasonal levels for the seventh consecutive week — quantitative strategists led by Jill Carey Hall wrote Tuesday in note to clients.
Besides Tesla, Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are also due to report earnings this week. And stakes are high.

Profits for the “Magnificent Seven” group — which also includes Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Nvidia Corp. — are forecast to rise about 40% in the first quarter from a year ago, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.
The group of tech megacaps is crucial to the S&P 500 since the companies carry the heaviest weightings in the benchmark. After this year’s advance, valuations have gotten lofty. After the latest selloff, the Magnificent Seven still traded at a combined 31 times forward earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
To Seema Shah at Principal Asset Management, the group will likely be able to extend its positive performance.
“After all, the strong balance sheet characteristics and secure competitive market positions of the Magnificent Seven imply that a significant correction is unlikely, despite their valuations drawing comparisons to the 2000s tech bubble,” she noted.
And despite all the macroeconomic fears, tech balance-sheets may shelter the sector from elevated rates, according to BI strategists led by Gina Martin Adams.
“While tech stocks have above-average and median duration relative to the rest of the market, the group also carries relatively little debt and maintains a far superior interest-rate coverage ratio to the rest of the index’s sectors,” they noted.
“Big Tech is carrying S&P 500 earnings growth this quarter, but the other 495 companies in the index will have to come into their own starting in the second quarter,” said Nicholas Colas at DataTrek Research. “Markets clearly believe this will occur, which is why large caps have held in fairly well, even as rates and geopolitical risks have risen.”
Brace for more declines in stock markets, warns Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s tactical specialist Scott Rubner.
Answering a barrage of questions from clients on whether the pullback in stock markets meant enough equity exposure was reduced last week, Rubner said “my reply is no.” He noted that Goldman clients have been reducing exposure on any uptick in stocks.
Goldman’s trading desk estimates that commodity trading advisers, or CTAs that surf the momentum of asset prices through long and short bets in the futures market, are modeled to sell stocks over the next week, no matter which way markets go.
To Mark Newton at Fundstrat, the stock rebound doesn’t mean the lows are in — but they look close — and breadth looks to have bottomed out.
“Technology has pulled back to good support, and should stabilize/rally post earnings,” he noted. “Value has taken a temporary lead over growth — which should prove temporary.”

91180,2025-03-08 14:00:00,Worried Another Inflation Surge Is on the Horizon? One Excellent Crypto to Buy Right Now and Hold for Decades.,"If you bought something for $100 in 1995, that same product would likely cost roughly $208 today. That's because inflation, which rose at an average rate of 2%-3% over the past three decades, consistently erodes the dollar's purchasing power.
The latest inflation spike, which started in 2021, was largely caused by volatile commodity prices, rising labor costs, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical conflicts. Increased government spending during the pandemic exacerbated that pressure.
Some investors touted cryptocurrencies as a hedge against inflation. But the interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, which were necessary to counter inflation,drove investors awayfrom cryptocurrencies and other speculative investments.
For now, cryptocurrencies might not seem like a reliable hedge against inflation. YetBitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC), the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, could consistently rise over the next few decades and stay ahead of inflation.
Bitcoin is mined with the energy-intensive proof of work (PoW) mechanism, which currently requires dedicated miners running on application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips. Nearly 20 million of Bitcoin's maximum supply of 21 million tokens has already been mined, and its last token is expected to be mined by 2140.
The rate of mining Bitcoin is slowing down because its mining rewards are cut in half every four years in scheduled ""halvings."" Bitcoin's most recent halving occurred last April, and each halving makes it more difficult to mine for a profit.
That increasing scarcity makes Bitcoin more comparable to gold than other cryptocurrencies, which are often staked through the more energy-efficient proof of stake (PoS) mechanism instead of being digitally mined. That's why the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that can be classified as a commodity instead of a security.
Bitcoin's bulls claim those qualities make it ""digital gold"" for the 21st century. If that's true, then it might be a great long-term hedge against inflation. If you had invested $100 in gold at the beginning of 1995, your investment would be worth about $740 today -- which would have easily offset the aforementioned inflation of the past three decades. If you invest in Bitcoin today, it might just go on the same inflation-beating trajectory over the next few decades (although there are no guarantees).
That outlook seems bright, but Bitcoin must overcome three major challenges before it's considered an inflation-beating investment. First, its price needs to stabilize. Over the past 52 weeks, its price has swung wildly between a low of $49,784 and a high of $109,012. By comparison, gold's price stayed in a narrower 52-week range between $2,088 and $2,974.
Unless Bitcoin starts trading in a tighter range, it will be hard for investors to take it seriously as a long-term hedge against inflation. It also won't be widely adopted as an alternative currency for payments as its price undergoes such wild swings.
Second, Bitcoin needs to attract more institutional investors. Only 38% of all institutional investors have committed 1%-5% of their portfolios to digital assets and crypto investments, according to a recent EY-Parthenon survey. But if those percentages rise over the next few years, Bitcoin's price could stabilize and gradually climb higher.
Lastly, Bitcoin must become more resistant to interest rate swings to be more comparable to gold. As inflation heated up between Dec. 31, 2021, to Dec. 31, 2023, gold's price rose 15% as Bitcoin's price dropped 11%. That divergence indicates it's premature to consider Bitcoin to be an inflation-resistant asset.
Bitcoin will likely remain volatile over the next few years. But over the next few decades, its price could stabilize as institutional investors ramp up their purchases, more countries adopt it as a national currency, and it's more widely used for financial transactions. If that happens, Bitcoin could become a long-term hedge against inflation.

Ethereum's highly anticipatedShanghai upgrade, also called the Shanghai-Capella hard fork, is set to occur Wednesday, after which users will have access to the $31 billion worth of ether (ETH) staked in the blockchain since December 2020.
The upgrade has been widely hailed aslong-term bullishfor Ethereum's native token. Still, bitcoin (BTC), not ether, is outperforming the broader crypto market and becoming more dominant as the upgrade approaches.
Bitcoin's dominance rate, which measures the largest cryptocurrency's share of crypto's total market valuation, rose to 48.5% early Tuesday, the highest since July 2021, according to data tracked by charting platform TradingView. The metric has risen by 15% this year.
Ether's dominance rate remains stagnant between 19% and 20%. That compares with a rise to 21% from 14% in the weeks before a software upgrade last September known as theMerge. That technological overhaul replaced Ethereum's at-the-time energy-intensive proof-of-work mechanism of verifying transactions with aproof-of-stakesystem and set the stage for Shanghai.Stakinginvolves depositing coins in the blockchain to boost the network's security and verify transactions in return for rewards.
Investor caution in pricing ether ahead of Shanghai stems from several factors, including concerns tokens unlocked after the upgrade will flood the market and regulatory issues.
""The Shanghai upgrade will unlock over 18 million ether staked since late 2020. The market is worried that the unlocking may bring about a sell-off, causing uncertainty in the market,"" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader at crypto asset-management firm Blofin, told CoinDesk.
While the upgrade will unlock more than 18 million ETH, onlypartial withdrawalsof 1.1 million ETH – the coins earned as staking rewards – will be withdrawable immediately.
Analysts haverecently saidthat the partial withdrawals will takeseveral daysto process and the resulting selling pressure is unlikely to be significant.
""If all partial withdrawals are attempted just after the Shapella fork (which seems highly improbable), it would take around four and a half days for these ETH profits to enter the market,"" Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, wrote in a note published Friday.
According to Outumuro, full withdrawals representing most of the ETH staked will take longer.
""It would take approximately 100 days for one-third of validators to exit if they all attempt to exit simultaneously, translating into $80-$100M worth of ETH being withdrawn per day. This would make up about 1% of ETH’s daily trading volume, though it is unlikely that all withdrawals will be sold,"" Outumuro noted.
The market, however, isn't convinced, as evident from ether's underperformance relative to bitcoin and ether put options, or bearish bets,drawing higher pricesthan call options.
Regulatory concerns are probably also weighing on investors. In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionallegedthat Ethereum staking services offered by centralized exchanges amount to selling unregistered securities in the U.S.
""ETH faces relatively higher regulatory risks. The SEC has repeatedly stated that ETH is a security rather than a commodity, which differs from the CFTC's opinion and means additional risk, so investors understandably prefer BTC,"" Ardern said, referring to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. agency that regulates the futures market.
Lastly, recent banking sector instability in the U.S. and the resulting sharp repricing of interest-rate expectations lower worldwide has benefited bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has evolved as a macro asset in the past three years and has a history ofdrawing safe-haven bidsduring banking crises.
""BTC got the store-of-value narrative back after multiple U.S. banks failed in mid-March. Since then, BTC's dominance rate has been rising,"" Dubai-based crypto analyst and trader Ritika Malik said. Dominance rate is now at a ""multiyear resistance"" that has capped the upside in the past, meaning ether and other coins could soon outshine bitcoin, Malik said.
""By being concerned, the market is actually 'pricing in' already any selling pressure that we are likely to get from the Shanghai hard fork and the upgrade could actually become a 'buy-the-news' event,"" she added. ""BTC dominance chart is at a multiyear resistance as well as we speak. All the stars are aligning for a rotation into ETH.""",30214.31,0.04,30181.68,-0.07,30051.02,-0.5,30183.32,-0.06,30201.55
82622,2025-01-08 05:06:54,"Arthur Hayes Predicts Crypto Market to Peak by March 2025, Driven by Dollar Liquidity","Arthur Hayes, former CEO of BitMEX and now Chief Investment Officer at Maelstrom, has adjusted his outlook on the cryptocurrency market,predictinga peak in March 2025. Hayes had initially speculated that the market would experience a significant downturn, or a “Trump dump,” once Donald Trump’s administration took office. He anticipated that investors would soon realize that the new president’s pro-crypto promises, including plans to establish a Bitcoin reserve and create a crypto-friendly environment, could be difficult to implement in the short term.
However, Hayes now believes that the expected “Trump dump” has already occurred. He believes the market correction likely took place between mid-December and the end of the year. Despite this, Hayes suggests that ongoing liquidity in the U.S. economy will continue to push the market upwards. Bitcoin's price has already increased by 5.5% in early January, and its market capitalization has surged over 10% to reach $2 trillion.
The driving factor behind Hayes’ revised prediction is the influx of dollar liquidity expected in the first quarter of 2025. He estimates that the U.S. Treasury’s spending and a decline in the Federal Reserve’s Reverse Repo Facility could inject up to $612 billion into the financial system by the end of March. This liquidity could fuel further bullish momentum in the crypto market, offsetting the potential disappointment surrounding Trump’s crypto policies.
Hayes believes that Bitcoin and other crypto assets will continue to perform well in the short term. He advises investors at his family office, Maelstrom, to take on more risk, recommending that they adopt a “degen” approach and invest in decentralized science (DeSci) tokens. Hayes disclosed that Maelstrom has already acquired tokens such as BIO, VITA, and NEURON.
Although Hayes remains positive about the near-term outlook for the crypto market, he warns that potential risks remain for the rest of 2025. These include debt ceiling negotiations, tax deadlines, and possible monetary policy changes by the Bank of Japan or China. However, Hayes maintains that the favorable liquidity environment will continue to drive the market upward through March 2025.
Looking ahead, experts predict that Bitcoin could reach values between $150,000 and $250,000 later in the year. Hayes encourages risk-takers to be bold in their investment decisions while keeping an eye on market dynamics as the year unfolds.",96123.28,-0.01,96242.42,0.11,96575.19,0.46,96531.68,0.41,96135.35

* Will become legal tender in 90 days
* Prices can be expressed, taxes paid in bitcoin
* Bukele to meet IMF Thursday
* Proposes bitcoin mining using volcanic energy (Adds reaction of residents, historic reference to negative impact of dollarization)
By Nelson Renteria, Tom Wilson and Karin Strohecker
SAN SALVADOR, June 9 (Reuters) - El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender after Congress on Wednesday approved President Nayib Bukele's proposal to embrace the cryptocurrency, a move that delighted the currency's supporters.
With 62 out of 84 possible votes, lawmakers voted in favor of the move to create a law to adopt bitcoin, despite concern about the potential impact on El Salvador's program with the International Monetary Fund.
Bukele has touted the use of bitcoin for its potential to help Salvadorans living abroad to send remittances back home, while saying the U.S. dollar will also continue as legal tender. In practice, El Salvador does not have its own currency.
""It will bring financial inclusion, investment, tourism, innovation and economic development for our country,"" Bukele said in a tweet shortly before the vote in Congress, which is controlled by his party and allies.
In an idea he appeared to have developed overnight, Bukele later said he had instructed state-owned geothermal electric firm LaGeo to develop a plan to offer bitcoin mining facilities using renewable energy from the country's volcanoes.
He said the idea was to build a bitcoin mining hub around the country's geothermal potential. He also said that El Salvador would offer citizenship to people who showed evidence they had invested in at least three bitcoins.
The use of bitcoin will be optional for individuals and would not bring risks to users, Bukele said, with the government guaranteeing convertibility to dollars at the time of transaction through a $150 million trust created at the country's development bank BANDESAL.
Under the law, bitcoin must be accepted by firms when offered as payment for goods and services. Tax contributions can also be paid in the cryptocurrency.
""If you go to a McDonald's or whatever, they cannot say we're not going to take your bitcoin, they have to take it by law because it's a legal tender,"" Bukele said in an online conversation he held with crypto-currency industry figures in parallel to the debate in Congress.
Its use as legal tender will begin in 90 days, with the bitcoin-dollar exchange rate set by the market. Bukele said the government and Central Bank did not currently hold any bitcoin.
In the capital, San Salvador, reactions were mixed, with some excited that the new currency could increase prosperity and financial options. Others were skeptical.
""How am I going to agree with this? I haven't seen it even in photos. I know nothing about it, you need to understand your currency,"" said Estela Gavidia, clutching shopping bags and recalling the loss of purchasing power many poor people suffered when the dollar was adopted in 2001.
Cryptocurrency supporters hailed the move as legitimising the emerging asset, but its impact on bitcoin regulation, taxation or adoption in other countries remains to be seen.
There were no immediate signs that other countries would follow El Salvador's embrace of bitcoin.
""Whether this becomes the first in what becomes a trend and then snowballs, or whether this will be a blip, we will only know through history,"" said Brandon Thomas, partner at advisory firm Grayline Group.
Analysts have also said the move could complicate talks with the IMF, where El Salvador seeks a more than $1 billion program.
Bukele said he will meet with the IMF on Thursday to discuss the bitcoin law, among other issues. He said in setting up the meeting he had tried to explain to them that the shift was ""not going to change our macroeconomics.""
Bitcoin enjoyed its best day in two weeks, rising as much as 6% to $35,200.
""The market will now be focused on adoption through El Salvador and whether other nations follow,"" said Richard Galvin of crypto fund Digital Asset Capital Management. ""This could be a key catalyst for bitcoin over the next two to three years.""
BEACH INSPIRATION
It was not immediately clear how long Bukele had been working on the bitcoin plan, but he said on Wednesday he was inspired by a project called Bitcoin Beach that introduced the cryptocurrency in an El Salvador beach town last year.
He worked on the idea with Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike, a digital wallet that uses the Lightning Network to enable small payments in Bitcoin.
Bukele has also pointed out a tweet of his from 2017, before he was a presidential candidate, in which he suggested using bitcoin.
Emerging economies - where bank penetration is much lower than in developed countries and reliance on money transfers from abroad much higher - have quickly warmed to cryptocurrencies.
Outside the United States, countries with the highest crypto production and trading volumes are all developing nations, according to BofA, including China, Colombia and India.
Bukele says some 70% of people in El Salvador lack access to traditional financial services.
But the use of digital currencies in general can also pose risks for dollarized economies, analysts say.
""The root cause of dollarization is high local inflation, which could worsen, too, if digital currencies prove inflationary,"" said David Hauner at BofA.
El Salvador relies heavily on money sent back from workers abroad. World Bank data showed remittances to the country made up nearly $6 billion or around a fifth of GDP in 2019, one of the highest ratios in the world. The cryptocurrency offers, in theory, a quick and cheap way to send money across borders without relying on remittance firms typically used for such transactions. It is not clear what proportion of remittances sent to El Salvador are in bitcoin.
Converting local currencies to and from bitcoin often relies on informal brokers, while trading often demands technical knowledge.
El Salvador will promote training and mechanisms to allow access to bitcoin transactions, the law said.
Financial regulators and policymakers warn bitcoin facilitates money laundering and other illicit uses.
Bukele brushed off the fears, saying criminals already use U.S. dollars and other assets to launder money.
""The problem is not the dollar, it is the criminals,"" he said.

Litecoin led the losers, followed by XRP. Tron gained the most, followed by Binance’s BNB. U.S. stock futures and Asian equities mostly rose, while European bourses were in the red.

Bitcoin gained 0.58% to US$29,184 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly gains to 0.19%, according to CoinMarketCapdata. The world’s largest cryptocurrency’s market capitalization rose 0.39% in the last 24 hours to US$566.96 billion.
“Trading is all about attractive risk-reward opportunities, and the calmness that keeps Bitcoin pinned at US$29,000 will not last long. Traders can exploit the collapse in implied and realized volatility and buy cheap upside calls,” Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in an emailed report on Thursday.
“Our Greed & Fear index continues to trade lower, signaling that Bitcoin prices (and Ethereum) could continue to correct lower,” Thielen added.
Ether, the world’s second biggest cryptocurrency also gained 0.27% in the past 24 hours to US$1,835, although posted a loss of 1.22% on the week.
Most top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed on Friday afternoon. Litecoin led losses, dropping 3.47% to US$82.88, bringing its weekly losses to 8.85%. Litecoin’sthird halving eventearlier this week failed to boost prices given continued difficulties in broader markets. Litecoin’s latest halving event cut the network’s mining rewards from 12.5 Litecoins per blockchain minted to 6.25 Litecoins, which will reduce the supply of new Litecoins from miners.
XRP was the day’s second biggest loser, dropping 1.73% to US$0.6587. The token has fallen 6.75% in the past seven days, as the dispute between Ripple Labs and the U.S. SEC continues.
In asummary judgmentin July, New York Southern District Court Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s programmatic sales of the XRP token on public exchanges do not constitute securities, but the verdict also said that Ripple’s XRP sales to institutional investors violated securities laws.
Ripple’s chief executive Brad Garlinghouse took to Twitter on Wednesday to criticize the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for using XRP’s transparency reports against the company as part of the lawsuit.
“We began these reports to voluntarily provide updates given our XRP holdings. Sadly, they were used against us in the SEC lawsuit – however, we remain steadfast in our commitment to transparency but I suspect they’re going to look a bit different moving forward,”Garlinghouse said.
Among gainers, Tron rose the most, climbing 1.28% to US$0.07742, although it declined 6.9% on the week. BNB, the native token of world’s largest crypto exchange Binance, was the second-biggest gainer in the past 24 hours, rising 1.09% to US$241.88, and posted a 0.48% gain on the week.
The total crypto market capitalization rose 0.16% to US$1.16 trillion, while market volume dropped 12.74% to US$29.02 billion in the past 24 hours.
The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed byCryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.
TheForkast 500 NFTindex dropped 0.33% to 2,471.79 in 24 hours to 6.30 p.m. in Hong Kong. The index has dropped 5.54% in the past seven days.
Forkast’s Ethereum, Solana and Polygon NFT market indexes all logged losses in the past 24 hours.
Total NFT sales volume dropped 7.81% to US$17.48 million, according to data fromCryptoSlam.
Sales volume on Ethereum, the largest NFT network, dropped 13.79% to US$11.65 million. NFT sales volume on Solana network strengthened 82.02% to US$1.62 million, making it the second-biggest by CryptoSlam rankings.
By collections, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club ranked number one, gaining 32.7% to US$966,422 in the past 24 hours.
Mythos-based DMarket ranked second by sales volume, although it fell 2.89% in the past 24 hours to US$817,526.
Elsewhere, NFT trading platform Nifty’s announced the closure of its business citing financial difficulties.
“Earlier this year, mindful of our limited resources in a difficult market, we pivoted to developing a platform for Web3 creators. Since then, we’ve been heads down building our new product and working on opportunities to access the capital required to keep building,” Nifty’stweetedon Thursday.
“Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, the investment opportunities we were working on didn’t pan out, and we now find ourselves at the end of our runway. As a result, and with a heavy heart, we are winding down our operations as of today.”
U.S. stock futures gained as of 7.20 p.m. in Hong Kong, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures, and the Nasdaq 100 futures all rising.
The Fitch Ratings credit agencyannouncedTuesday that it had downgraded the U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA+.
“We expect the repercussions of the Fitch downgrade to be limited as following the S&P downgrade in 2011, most investors rewrote their investment management accounts to accommodate U.S. Treasuries, regardless of rating. That being said, we do think that over the medium term, it will cause investors to take a second look at the U.S. debt burden and the sustainability at these levels,” Lisa Hornby, head of U.S. multi-sector fixed income at Schroders, said in an emailed statement on Friday.
“It is very unusual to be running a budget deficit of 8.5% in a non-recessionary period and we suspect that over time, this will increase the term premium demanded for U.S. Treasuries and put downward pressure on the U.S. dollar,” Hornby added.
Investors are looking forward to Friday’s U.S. jobs report. Wall Street experts expect the number of nonfarm payrolls to have increased by 200,000, according toCNBC. That number would be the smallest gain since December 2020 and may indicate an economic contraction.
Asian stock markets mostly rose on Friday after the People’s Bank of China, the central bank of the world’s second largest economy,saidon Thursday that it would increase financial resources to support the private sector.
China’sShenzhen Component, Hong Kong’sHang Seng, and Japan’sNikkeistrengthened, while South Korea’sKospidropped at the end of trading hours on Friday.
India’sSensexindex at the Bombay Stock Exchange closed 0.74% higher on Friday. Morgan Stanleyupgradedits view on India’s markets to‘overweight’on Thursday, indicating that the world’s most populous nation would perform better in the future. India’s upgrade comes in the same week the U.S. lost its AAA status.
European bourses were in red, with both the benchmark STOXX 600 and Germany’s DAX 40 losing during afternoon trading hours in Europe. Investors continue to assess corporate results while awaiting U.S. payrolls report later in the day which may provide guidance on the Federal Reserve’s next steps.

The U.S. Dollar Index has recently made an attempt to settle below the support level at 96.25 but failed to develop sufficient downside momentum and rebounded closer to the resistance at 96.50. In case the U.S. Dollar Index settles above this resistance level, it will head towards the resistance at 96.70 which will be bullish for USD/CAD.

Traders will also continue to monitor the developments in oil markets asWTI oilis currently trying to settle above the $88 level. A move above this level will push WTI closer to the psychogically important $90 level which will be bullish for commodity-related currencies, including Canadian dollar.
USD to CAD is testing the support level at 1.2680. In case USD to CAD manages to settle below this support level, it will get to another test of the support which is located at the 50 EMA at 1.2665.
A move below the 50 EMA will open the way to the test of the support at 1.2650. If USD to CAD declines below this level, it will head towards the next support at 1.2625.
On the upside, the previous support at 1.2710 will serve as the first resistance level for USD to CAD. In case USD to CAD climbs back above this level, it will head towards the resistance at 1.2730. A successful test of this level will push USD to CAD towards the next resistance at 1.2760.

A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall to an early morning intraday low $47,120.0 before making a move.
Bitcoin fell through the first major support level at $47,275 before rallying to a late afternoon intraday high $49,196.0.

Finding late support, however, Bitcoin broke back through the first major resistance level to end the day at $48,200 levels.
The near-term bullish trend remained intact, supported the latest return to $49,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need a sustained fall through the 62% FIB of $27,237 to form a near-term bearish trend.

It was a bearish start for the rest of the majors, however.
At the time of writing, Chainlink was down by 0.79% to lead the way down.
Bitcoin would need to move back through the $48,186 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $49,252 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break back through to $49,000 levels.
Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Sunday’s high $49,196.0 would likely cap the upside.
In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at the 23.6% FIB of $50,473 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $50,262.
Failure to move back through the $48,186 would bring the first major support level at $47,176 into play.
Barring an extended sell-off on the day, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$47,000. The second major support level sits at $46,110.

16877,2018-02-02 22:56:00,Why 2017 Was a Year to Forget for Wells Fargo & Company,"Nearly all of the ""big four"" banks in the U.S. -- Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) , JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) , Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) , and Citigroup (NYSE: C) -- had a fine 2017 . Their fundamentals and stock prices rose notably on strong macroeconomic factors, slowly rising interest rates, potentially looser regulation, and a new tax regime that could net them billions of dollars in additional profits. Wells Fargo was an unhappy exception. Bad choices by the bank seemed to harm client trust, which hurt fundamentals, which leeched enthusiasm for the stock. In Wells Fargo's long and occasionally glorious history, 2017 wasn't exactly a year to remember. A Wells Fargo branch Image source: Wells Fargo. Scandalized Wells Fargo's biggest problem in 2017 was the scandals that plagued it during the year. The mother of these, the "" fake accounts scandal ,"" actually broke late in 2016. But last year it was discovered that this affected more customers than initially reported. On top of that, the bank engendered a similar controversy by apparently, let's say, volunteering certain customers for auto insurance products they didn't actually buy. Not one to go small, the bank was also accused of charging clients improper fees tied to mortgages. In the company's latest reported quarter (Q4 of fiscal 2017), revenue inched up by 2% on a year-over-year basis, landing at $22.1 billion. At least there was an increase; in the three preceding quarters, the bank either flat-lined or saw declines in the top line. Per-share adjusted net income, meanwhile, rose just slightly to $0.97 from the year-ago quarter's $0.96. Loans were down, however, slipping by 1%, while deposits fell by 2%. The efficiency ratio of the once admirably lean bank jumped to 76% from the year-ago 66% -- which was already a high figure for the company. And this was generally a great year for banks. Wells Fargo's Q4 profitability came in under analyst expectations, marking the second time in fiscal 2017 that occurred. By contrast, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Bank of America all notched earnings beats in each of the year's four quarters. Story continues No doubt as a result, Wells Fargo's stock has been trudging behind the rest of the quartet and the broader market: WFC Chart WFC data by YCharts Not everything was dire for Wells Fargo in 2017. Customers might be more shy about depositing their money in the bank after the scandals, but customers with plastic don't seem to mind. The company reported encouraging growth of 6% in transaction volume on the credit cards it has issued. Also, due to improved results in the company's insurance operations, total noninterest income also saw a 6% boost. And the bank seems to be keeping its big lead in mortgage originations, along with a mortgage servicing portfolio that has been second to none, despite declines in its overall take from home lending. Lastly, we should also keep in mind that Wells Fargo was still well in the black on the bottom line during the year, even with its numerous challenges. Happier New Year All in all, however, last year wasn't a good one for Wells Fargo. It struggled to overcome the fallout from the original fake accounts scandal. Instead of getting past this, the bank made more mistakes and eroded customer trust further. The bank is probably lucky it managed to grow its revenue at all for the year. Wells Fargo has a long and at times admirable history dating back to 1852. There have been many standout years in that stretch. Alas, 2017 wasn't one of them.

96079,2025-04-24 01:09:46,"Michael Saylor Backs New SEC Chair Paul Atkins as Strategy Buys 6,556 Bitcoin Worth $555M","Michael Saylor, CEO of Strategy, publiclyendorsednewly appointed SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, stating on April 23 that Atkins “will be good for Bitcoin.”
The statement came days after Atkins was sworn in as the 34th chair of the SEC during a White House ceremony led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Atkins, who previously served at the SEC from 2002 to 2008, has a background in digital assets, including his role as co-chair of the Token Alliance and an advisor to the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX.
Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, recently added 6,556 BTC to its holdings for approximately $555 million, bringing its total to 538,200 BTC worth over $50.5 billion. Saylor also revealed that Strategy’s Bitcoin yield has reached 12.1% for the year. In a tweet, he hinted at the purchase with a chart labeled “Insufficient Orange,” referencing Bitcoin’s market supply. According to Saylor, over 13,000 financial institutions and 814,000 retail accounts now hold shares in Strategy, indirectly exposing 55 million people to Bitcoin through ETFs, pensions, insurance portfolios, and mutual funds.
Vincent Liu of Kronos Research said Atkins is expected to finalize custody rules and clarify asset classifications—steps seen as critical for regulatory certainty and institutional adoption. He stressed the importance of guardrails like disclosure of industry ties and ethics oversight to avoid conflicts of interest.
Atkins’ appointment has drawn mixed reactions. While some in the crypto industry see his leadership as a positive shift, Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized his judgment during his previous SEC tenure and questioned his consulting work at Patomak Global Partners, which advised FTX before its collapse. Warren noted that Atkins’ firm charged clients over $1,200 per hour and accused him of being positioned to benefit his past clients. She also raised concerns about his financial disclosure, which showed personal and family assets worth more than $327 million.
Blue Macellari of T. Rowe Price welcomed the appointment, citing recent SEC-led roundtables with industry professionals as signs of a more open approach to crypto regulation. She believes this engagement could lead to more thoughtful policy decisions. Bitwise general counsel Katherine Dowling and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also expressed support, calling Atkins a “great choice” and saying he would bring “common sense” back to the agency.
In parallel with these regulatory developments, Bitcoin continues to perform strongly. As of April 23, it was trading around $94,000, up 5%. Market observers note steady momentum, with long-term holders and institutional investors maintaining confidence despite regulatory uncertainty.",93428.8,0.0,93206.53,-0.24,93399.67,-0.03,93445.88,0.02,93428.57

Well that's a doozy. If you go on bitcoin.org it says, ""Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and a completely digital money."" It then goes into another paragraph that buries the lead – that bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet.
So let’s back up. At its most basic level - Bitcoin is an online currency. If you’re a serious finance type, you may note that it behaves slightly like a commodity, but for the sake of explanation, it’s best to think of Bitcoin as an online currency.
No one is precisely sure who created it, but it's steeped in a sort of anarchic ""damn-the-man"" legend because it's the first modern currency not tied to a central bank or a government. Proponents say that makes it the currency of the future.

So how does it work? Once upon a time, you could only get bitcoins by ""mining"" for them, i.e. computer nerds would sit around solving complex computer things and be rewarded with Bitcoins. Back in the day, they were worth practically nothing. Now, a bitcoin is worth roughly $350. Earlier in the year, that value came close to $1,000.
If you're not a computer nerd - you can still use Bitcoin. While it was once the currency of shady online dealings, Bitcoins are now being accepted by a growing number of mainstream businesses – think Expedia (EXPE), Overstock (OSTK), Paypal (EBAY) and Zynga (ZNGA).
You can go about getting them a few different ways. Several online exchanges allow you to purchase them. You can accept them as payment for goods or services. And lastly – you can avoid the internet entirely by going to a Bitcoin ATM, though be forewarned,there aren’t manyof these in the U.S.
If you want to know if Bitcoin is worth the hype, that's a separate question.

A number of investors are hugely bullish on the currency – notably Marc Andreessen. The infamous Winklevoss twins have a Bitcoin-based ETF listed on the Nasdaq. Even former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke seems excited about it, or at least as excited as Ben Bernanke ever gets. He said the currency “may hold long term promise.""
There are plenty of bears, too. Legendary investor Warren Buffett calls Bitcoin a “mirage” and warns investors to “stay away.” The SEC has warned investors to beware as well.

29914,2018-05-03 20:02:00,Crypto Hardware Giant Bitmain to Release First Zcash ASIC Miner,"Equihash, the Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining algorithm used by Zcash and a variety of other cryptocurrencies, is about to get a lot less equitable.
On Wednesday, mining hardware manufacturerBitmainrevealed that it had developed the first Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miner capable of mining on Equihash-secured networks.
Bitmain’s Zcash ASIC miner — the Antminer Z9 Mini — has an advertised hashrate of 10k Sol/s and is scheduled to begin shipping in late June.
However, it’s likely that this new era for the previously ASIC-resistant mining algorithm has already begun, because most people believe that Bitmain privately begins using its new ASICs months before it announces them to the general public.
Critics of ASICs argue that the development of these miners centralizes hashpower, particularly since Bitmain does not currently have a sizable competitor in this nascent market.
Consequently, Zcash adopted Equihash to stave off the development of Zcash ASIC miners, and the cryptocurrency has heretofore been mined primarily using hardware powered by general purpose GPU chips, which are widely used among PC gamers.
Bitmain has methodically cracked previously ASIC-resistant mining algorithms in recent months, unveiling miners for the Ethash, Cryptonight, and Blake(2b) algorithms.
Monero, the most prominent Cryptonight coin, recentlyaltered its instance of the mining algorithmso that Bitmain’s Cryptonight ASIC would not be compatible with its network, and Ethereum — which is secured by Ethash — hasdebatedadopting similar measures.
So far, at least one Equihash coin — Bitcoin Gold — hasstatedthat it will activate a hard fork to maintain ASIC resistance once Bitmain begins shipping its Equihash ASIC miners.
Just hours before Bitmain announced that it was releasing a Zcash ASIC miner, Zcash co-founder Zooko Wilcox wrote in aforum postthat, knowing ASIC-resistance cannot be maintained forever, he has been educating himself on the current state of cryptocurrency mining.
Wilcox, who is also CEO of the privately-operated Zcash Company, said that he had been struck at how essential GPU mining was for people in countries such as Venezuela, where ASIC miners — which need to be imported — would likely be stolen during shipment.
“Oh, bottom-line, by the way, is that I’m basically still in the same place now that I was four years ago when we first decided to go for widespread-distribution-of-coins at the expense of sunk-cost-incentive-alignment,” he concluded. “I still think that widespread-distribution-of-coins is more important” even though “it can’t last forever.”

74119,2022-01-28 13:22:38,"MARA, RIOT, SDIG, BTBT, BSGA: Bitcoin Mining Stocks Face Pressure Ahead of Feb. 10","Shares of Bitcoin mining stocks, includingRiot Blockchain(NASDAQ:RIOT) andMarathon Digital(NASDAQ:MARA), are under pressure after Sen. Elizabeth Warren gave the companies until Feb. 10 to provide information on their energy use and its impact on climate change.

TheFebruary deadlinealso includesStronghold Digital Mining(NASDAQ:SDIG),Bit Digital(NASDAQ:BTBT) andBlue Safari(NASDAQ:BSGA), which is merging withBitdeer.
Importantly, this deadline comes as Warren expands her ongoing inquiry ofBitcoin(CCC:BTC-USD) miners’ “extraordinarily high energy usage” and its environmental impacts. The inquiry puts additional pressure on Bitcoin mining stocks amid great market volatility. Recent weeks have also seen plunges in digital assets such asBitcoin(CCC:BTC-USD) andEthereum(CCC:ETH-USD). RIOT and MARA stock have each fallen 40% so far in January.

In the letter, Warren asked each crypto miner to detail electricity consumption, scaling plans, agreements with electricity companies, and impact on energy costs for consumers and small businesses. As part of this, she asked the miners to submit the information by Feb. 10.
“The extraordinarily high energy usage and carbon emissions associated with Bitcoin mining could undermine our hard work to tackle the climate crisis,” reads Warren’s letter.
Her inquiry is the latest in a series of political actions on cryptocurrency miners that targets their energy consumption. Notably, Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus protocol has attracted attention for its high usage. Lawmakers have held Congressional hearings to discuss mining, and regulators in the European Unionhave also called for a ban on proof-of-work.
At the same time that Warren’s demands for information on crypto miners’ energy use was released, media reports have also surfaced that President Joe Biden is preparing anexecutive orderthat would require government agencies to conduct risk analysis on cryptocurrencies as a national security threat. The reports say that the White House is expected to issue an executive order in the coming weeks about actions the U.S. government will take.
The rationale for the executive order is that cryptocurrencies allow users to more easily transfer money across borders. Additionally, theAmerica Competes Act, is currently before Congress. The act would enable the U.S. Treasury Secretary to ban cryptocurrency exchanges from operating. The America Competes Act has not yet been passed by Congress, but is causing concerns among cryptocurrency operators and investors.
Warren’s targeting of cryptocurrency miners is the latest example of lawmakers ratcheting up pressure on the cryptocurrency sector. Many industry players, investors and analysts fear that it is only a matter of time before miners, exchanges and the digital coins themselves are slapped with regulations.
This is all bad news, and comes at a difficult time for cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin is currently trading at $37,150, which is 46% below its all-time high. Ethereum, at $2,440, has fallen 37% in the last month. The declining prices of cryptocurrencies is harming Bitcoin mining stocks. The scrutiny of lawmakers such as Warren, and threats of regulations, is adding to the pain for cryptocurrency mining stocks and their shareholders.
The next month will be important for cryptocurrency miners. In addition to the Feb. 10 deadline set by Warren, the White House executive order on cryptocurrencies is expected to be issued within weeks. Taken together, they could push the prices of stocks such as RIOT and MARA even lower. Investors should prepare themselves for greater volatility ahead as politicians and regulators keep their sights trained on the cryptocurrency industry.

If you are looking for exciting stocks and cryptos to buy in 2023,SoFi(NASDAQ:SOFI) is a company worth considering. SoFi operates in the lending, technology platform, and financial services segments.
Although younger than most of its peers, it boasts a sound track record of innovation in fintech. Its bank charter designation in 2022 positions it well to offer a full suite of financial services.
SoFi’s recent developments are intriguing. The company now offers high-yield checking and savings accounts to its 5.2 million members.
SoFi has amassed$7.3 billion in deposits, up from $1 billion at the beginning of 2022. These deposits are vital to funding the lending segment, which includes personal, student, and home loans, with a lower cost of capital.
Investors are particularly drawn to SoFi’s pioneering student lending business, which initially disrupted the market with flexible repayment options and competitive rates.
Despite challenges from the pandemic-induced loan moratorium, SoFi diversified its offerings, ultimately emerging as a stronger, more versatile company. The moratorium still hurts, and SoFi is pursuing the matter legally. However, the overall business model remains healthy.
In summary, SoFi is among the hot and trending stocks and cryptos to watch out for in the coming year and might be one of the best and most exciting stocks and cryptos to invest in.

Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN) is a leading e-commerce giant, one of the hottest and most exciting stocks to invest in for several years. The tech behemoth, boasting an extensive array of products and services, consistently sets trends in the e-commerce industry.
It has also made significant inroads in cloud computing and digital streaming, offering its customers diverse offerings. In short, it is one of the most diversified companies on the planet.
However, the stock is down substantially from its 52-week high. Nevertheless, Amazon’s market leadership suggests a strong potential for long-term recovery.
The industries Amazon caters to, such as e-commerce and cloud computing, are far from reaching maturity. Both sectors continue to exhibit remarkable growth potential, likely fueling Amazon’s returns in the years ahead.
In terms of the best exciting stocks and cryptos to buy in 2023, Amazon is one of the most promising options. Its strong track record of innovation and leadership in e-commerce makes it a trending stock to watch out for.

Monero(XMR-USD) provides privacy and security attributes, helping it stand out among a sea of altcoins. However, it is not enjoying the rally thatBitcoin(BTC-USD) andEthereum(ETH-USD) are experiencing. That means it is an ideal time to purchase more coins because the markets are not pricing this one to perfection.
The cutting-edge technology and strong community support make it one of the hottest and most exciting stocks and cryptos to consider in 2023. It has also been touted as a potential investment opportunity for those seeking diversification in their crypto portfolio. As a trending stock in the crypto space, Monero’s potential for growth and innovation could make it one of the best exciting stocks and cryptos to watch.
This cryptocurrency has been in existence since 2014, which is a significant period in a rapidly changing crypto market. With increasing regulations on cryptocurrencies in several countries, including the United States, Monero has become an attractive investment option. As regulations tighten, a growing demand for private cryptocurrency transactions is growing, giving Monero a clear use case. In my mind, that makes it a dark horse pick for continued success in the crypto market.

Basic Attention Token(BAT-USD) is a promising cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain. It was created by the co-founder of Mozilla Firefox and JavaScript, Brendan Eich, and has been gaining traction in the crypto market due to its innovative approach to digital advertising.
BAT seeks to transform the digital advertising sector through a decentralized platform that compensates users for their time and attention to viewing ads. It offers a unique value proposition by allowing users to earn rewards for internet browsing. By installing the Brave browser, users get paid in BAT for viewing ads, shifting the profit from companies to individuals.
With over 50 million monthly active users, Brave is one of the most successful crypto ventures, demonstrating its potential for growth and innovation in the market.
Rising concerns about online privacy and the demand for user-friendly, transparent digital advertising have made BAT a trending and exciting crypto to watch in 2023. As a top pick among exciting stocks and cryptos, BAT holds considerable growth potential.

Despite past controversies,Ripple(XRP-USD) has been an established cryptocurrency for years and is one of the most enticing and auspicious digital investments available. XRP has a strong use case in cross-border payments and is being adopted by several large financial institutions. With increasing adoption and use, XRP could be a hot and trending crypto to watch in 2023.
Ripple’s XRP is a fast, cheap crypto with hundreds of financial partners for international payments. However, in late 2020, the SEC sued Ripple, leading to XRP’s delisting by major US exchanges. Despite this, XRP remains a top crypto, and as Ripple’s legal woes resolve, it could see renewed investor interest.
The key thing to remember is that XRP is incredibly risky right now. So, if you decide to invest, ensure it is in small amounts. American authorities are in an aggressive mood. Therefore, investing in XRP comes with its pros and cons. On the bright side, investing in it will benefit you if the case works out in Ripple’s favor.

30237,2018-05-06 05:03:19,"Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 06/05/18","Bitcoin Cash rallied 16.23% on Saturday, following Friday’s 0.24% consolidation, to end the day at $1,763.2.
It was full steam ahead from the get go, the day’s $1,510 low coming at the start of the day, holding well above the first major support level of $1,462.57 and 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,347.5.
Through the day’s first major resistance level at $1,557.87 within the first few hours, Bitcoin Cash broke through the second resistance level at $1,600.83 and third major resistance level at $1,696.13 with ease to hit a new swing hi $1,765, with a hold above the day’s third major resistance level by the day’s end a strong bullish signal for the week ahead.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash was up 1.81 to $1,797.0, as the march towards $2,000 continues ahead of the hard fork.
A morning high $1,849.9 came within the first few hours, with Bitcoin Cash testing the day’s first major resistance level of $1,848.8 early on in the day before a pullback to current levels, the day’s $1,754.3 low coming at the start of the day.
For the day ahead, the bulls will have $2,000 in mind and the way things are going, there’s no reason for a pullback later in the day, few likely to be locking in profits with more than a week to go before the much talked about hard fork.
A pullback to sub-$1,700 levels could see some money come off the table, bringing the day’s first major support level at $1,593.8 into play, though with a positive start, the path of least resistance is likely to be onwards and upwards today.

Litecoin gained 5.38% on Saturday, following Friday’s 4.47% rise, to end the day at $177.3.
It was the 4thconsecutive day of gains, with Litecoin beginning to garner some attention, having had a slow start to the week.
After a range bound start to the day, an afternoon rally saw Litecoin break through the day’s first major resistance level at $173.92 and second major resistance level at $179.65 with ease to hit a new swing hi $182.35 before easing back to $170 levels by the close.
Holding above the day’s first major resistance level supported a bullish start to today, with the day’s major support levels left untested on Saturday.
At the time of writing, Litecoin was up 0.55% to $178.7, with a morning high $181.95 coming within the first hour of the day before easing back, with the day’s first major resistance level at $184.09 left untested.
With Litecoin having a range bound start to the day, a morning low $177 leaving the day’s first major support level at $168.77 untested, it looks set up for another bullish day ahead, with a move back through to the day’s high $181.95 supporting a run at the day’s first major resistance level at $184.09, with $190 levels in play should Bitcoin Cash continue on its climb towards $2,000 and Bitcoin break through $10,000.
Failing to move back through to the morning’s high could see Litecoin pullback to test the day’s first major support level at $168.77, though we would expect Litecoin to receive plenty of support at $170 barring a broad based sell-off across the crypto market.
It’s looking bullish and the bulls will be looking for $200 levels in the coming days.

Ripple’s XRP gained just 1.51% on Saturday, following Friday’s 0.61% rise, to end the day at $0.90211.
A range bound start to the day left the day’s major support and resistance levels untested before an early afternoon move saw Ripple’s XRP break through the day’s first major resistance level at $0.9285 with an intraday high $0.93828 before a late in the day reversal saw Ripple’s XRP test 0.$90 support ahead of the day’s end.
The moves through the day were in contrast to the general market trend, with the majors having been on the rise late in the day.
At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up just 0.31% to $0.90756, recovering from a start of the day $0.89473 low to hit a morning high $0.92167 before easing back to current levels.
Ripple’s XRP has been seeing plenty of volatility in recent days and this morning is no different, holding on to $0.90 levels key to continue supporting the current bullish trend formed back at 6thApril’s swing lo $0.45716.
Unlike its peers, Ripple’s XRP has failed to hit a new swing hi since the 24thApril’s $0.96837, while holding at $0.90 levels for the first time since 25thApril on Saturday will have given the bulls some hope of a move back through to $1.00 levels in the coming week.
For the day ahead, a move through to $0.93 levels will be needed to draw in buyers on hopes of another Ripple splash, failure to do so likely to bring the day’s first major support level at $0.8542 into play later in the day.
A move is on the cards and much will depend upon the sentiment across the market on whether Ripple’s XRP can catch up with the rest of the clan or go into reverse, investors mindful of holding on to April’s 67% gains.

15844,2021-02-26 15:39:19,Is Now The Time To Buy Royal Caribbean Stock?,"Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd(NYSE:RCL) shares are up 15.6% in the last week as investors overlook abysmal fourth-quarter earnings numbers and instead focused on bullish longer-term commentary.
What Happened:On Monday, Royal Caribbean reported that it lost $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2020, Royal Caribbean reported a $5.8-billion net loss and $2.21 billion in revenue, down 79.8% from a year ago.

The company followed up the earnings report with news is it raising another $1 billion in cash via asecondary offering. At the company’s current cash burn rate of around $500 million per month, that $1 billion will buy Royal Caribbean another two months of operation.
The good news is that management said the company has ""seen a 30% increase in new bookings since the beginning of the year when compared to November and December.""
That commentary appears good enough for investors betting the cruise business will bounce back in a big way in the second half of 2021.
Why One Royal Caribbean Analyst Is Skeptical:Dispute the bullish move in the stock, analysts remain skeptical.
BofA Securities analyst Andrew Didora said this week that investors don’t seem to fully appreciate how much long-term damage has already been done to Royal Caribbean’s balance sheet.
“Longer term we see risk of demand impairment as a result of the outbreak and forecast a long tail for net yields to return to the prior peak, which will likely continue to put further pressure on the balance sheet,” Didora wrote.
BofA has an Underperform rating and $65 target for Royal Caribbean.
RCL Price Action:Royal Caribbean shares were down 0.35% at $91.31 at last check Friday.
Benzinga’s Take:Royal Caribbean shares up at least 218% since the March 2020 market low, which is a huge run for a business that is still completely dead in the water until at least May.
The ultimate fate of the industry will be determined by how long it takes the leisure travel business to recover and whether the pandemic has permanently changed consumer demand.

58982,2021-01-27 19:21:38,15 takeaways from Brandon Beane’s end of season press conference,"The Buffalo Bills are putting the finishing touches on the season that was. In doing so, there’s one thing that separates players and front office members alike from locker cleanout day and freedom from football for a few months in the offseason: A trip to the podium. On the latter, Bills general manager Brandon Beane concluded his 2020 season on Wednesday by chatting via video conference for about an hour. He reviewed the season that was and previewed some of what the future might hold. In an effort to pull out some of the more interesting or important things mentioned, here are 15 takeaways from Beane’s end of season presser: What was said about Josh Allen Like Bills head coach Sean McDermott on Tuesday , there was no way Beane was going to chat without being asked about quarterback Josh Allen . In regard to the GM, the headline topic of discussion wouldn’t be the on-field stuff, though. It’s the off-field stuff, a.k.a. his contract situation. It was previously reported on Jan. 9 that Allen could receive a “massive” extension from the team this offseason. Beane said he wouldn’t comment on specifics, but he certainly did mention something that indicates that the Bills wouldn’t be afraid to pay their QB. After a breakout season, Beane said he thinks Allen could be even better in the future. “Very proud of Josh,” Beane said. “I think he’s shown people what he can do in this league and I don’t think he’s reached his ceiling.” If that’s the case, Beane is not going to be scared of backing up the Brinks truck when the time for an extension comes up. Not a Super Bowl team Beane was brutally honest about one thing. Just because you’re one game away from the Super Bowl, it doesn’t mean you are a “Super Bowl team.” While that might be pretty strong of a statement, there’s is no debating it: That is the truth. “I still think we need to be very honest with where we’re at. We’re still not a Super Bowl team. There’s one team happy at the end of the year. We made a great step last year and another step this year, but we still have to go further. The goal here is to win that game [the Super Bowl], and until we get in that game to compete for it, we can’t win it,” Beane said. Story continues The GM was also very praiseful of the Kansas City Chiefs after their roster beat up his, 38-24, in Sunday’s AFC Championship game. “They’re the gold standard. This is three-straight AFC Championships they’ve been in, in a row, and now back-to-back Super Bowls,” Beane said. “They’re the gold standard of the AFC and maybe the league, we’ll find out here next week.” “They were clearly better than us. We have work to do,” he added. Projected salary cap struggles causing regret? The 2021 salary cap is going to be a problem for the Bills. But it’s a league-wide issue as COVID-19 will cause a drop to the cap for next season. The NFL already announced that the cap “floor” or the lowest it could possibly be, will be $175M. Usually each year it grows and prior to COVID, Beane said most teams expected it to be near $210M. That’s a massive difference. In discussing that, Beane did interestingly admit, flat-out, he wouldn’t have done certain roster moves had he known what was coming. “It’s one of those things you wish we knew a year ago, maybe we wouldn’t have made every move that we did. Maybe we wouldn’t have been so aggressive in some areas,” Beane said. Naturally Beane did not name names. We can guess what some of those could be in free agency. High-profile free agents added last offseason include Mario Addison, Quinton Jefferson , and Vernon Butler … along with not cutting Trent Murphy who was a potential salary cap casualty at the end of training camp. Interesting, all these players are defensive linemen as well. Don’t expect a big move The Bills made it to the final four of the NFL season. Because of that, they clearly do already have a good roster and therefore, don’t have to make some kind of massive move to shake things up. Unfortunately for fans, that makes for a more boring offseason and considering all of that, Beane all but said he’s not going to be making any earth-shaking deals or signings this offseason like he has in the past. “We’re going to have to draft well, that’s first off,” Beane said. “This is not going to be a free agency that we can be as aggressive. We’ve been aggressive with that because we built up the resources.” “Now we’re getting to the point where we don’t have to go out and add pieces from free agency. We’ll have to see how many of the guys we can retain. We’ll fill in some holes here and there. But I would not anticipate and blockbuster moves of Stef Diggs,” Beane added. “It’s really going to be plugging some holes.” Again, makes total sense. Stefon Diggs a year later Well, it has not been a full year since Stefon Diggs was traded to the Bills, but we’re one season into it. Upon reflecting on acquiring the wide receiver, Beane called the deal he made with the Minnesota Vikings the same as many do. “I thought it was a win-win,” Beane said. Upon discussing the Diggs journey to Buffalo, Beane made one interesting note. Once Beane was able to actually sit down and talk to the wideout (COVID made that hard at first), the GM said that Diggs did not just point to the Vikings and say it was all their fault. Diggs evidently took blame, too. From there, Beane said the Bills told him Buffalo would be giving him a “fresh start” and the rest is history. “He was just golden from start to finish,” Beane said. Unprompted running game mention The Bills did not have a good rushing attack in 2020. Observers of the team do not need numbers to prove that. Everyone saw it. Improving in that area seems like it’s going to be a point of emphasis for Beane this offseason because in an unprompted manner, Beane mentioned doing just that when aske what his “focus” would be on this offseason in terms of improving this offseason. “Maybe a little more balance on the run game,” Beane said. “The ability to run it when you have to.” “Things like that which will help your offense because you’re not always going to be able to track meet everybody up and down the field,” Beane added. Believes the Bills missed a Star According to Beane, the Bills missed Star Lotulelei in 2020. In the first half of the year, Buffalo struggled against the run, in particular, and pointed to reasons as to why, Beane said losing Jordan Phillips in free agency a year ago and then not having Lotulelei was the reason for some of that in his mind. “I know he’s not a 10 sack guy and things like that, but what he provides, not only for the run game, but for our linebackers to roam free, I think it took those guys a little time,” Beane said. But it’s not just the running backs Of course the running backs do play a part in rushing the ball. Beane said that they can miss the hole among other issues. The GM did say the blocking has to be better. “I think it’s unfair to look at the running backs to point blame on the running backs. Running the football is very complex. It’s the O-line, it’s the tight ends, it’s the receivers. If one guy doesn’t make his block, the play is probably dead,” Beane said. Since 2019 when the Bills revamped their offensive line, it’s been such a contrast between pass protection and run blocking. Very often Allen has time to work. That game against the Chiefs was just a bad game for Buffalo’s O-line in terms of pass blocking. But for just about 19 games… the running game blocking was not good for the Bills and it sounds like Beane recognizes that. “I’m not looking at Devin Singletary or Zack Moss and thinking those guys came up short for us,” Beane concluded. Speaking of the offensive line, Beane later mentioned both center Mitch Morse and guard Ike Boettger . On Morse, Beane said he thought he played “really well down the stretch” and on Boettger, Beane said he did “a really good job” and he “mixed really well” with left tackle Dion Dawkins . Two young defenders Here’s how Beane reflected upon the 2020 seasons for two of his roster’s young building blocks on defense. On defensive tackle Ed Oliver: “Ed is playing really well. If people want to just look at sac numbers, he doesn’t have those but he impacts the game. Not only the pass game but the run game. He’s growing, he’s learning…. Ed faces a lot of doubles, too. It’s not the easiest road for him. I definitely though he took a step up from Year 1 to Year 2.” On linebacker Tremaine Edmunds: “In fairness to him, I think when he banged his shoulder up that first game, he got back out there, I think it took him awhile. It was his first injury he played with. I think he struggled with it. I thought he played, overall, pretty solid down the stretch.” Rookie review Beane mentioned his rookies several times. In a general sentiment, the general manager was overall pleased with them all. Here’s a breakdown of his thoughts on all guys mentioned: DE AJ Epenesa Per Beane, the Bills wanted Epenesa to play at a smaller weight than he did in college. At the 2020 draft, Epenesa fell because of his 40-yard dash time, so the team probably thought cutting weight would help there. Turns out, Beane said Epenesa then was “probably too light” and had to pack some on. Being too light cause the Bills to think he would struggle against the run. This also might explain why he was a healthy scratch to start the season. RB Zack Moss “He did a really good job and showed he could run physical,” Beane said. Toward the end of the year, it sounds like the Bills liked him more. Moss started seeing a slight increase over Singletary in snaps because he suffered an ankle injury and Beane said the “hot hand” was getting more touches. That guy was Moss. QB Jake Fromm We heard nothing on backup QB Jake Fromm all season because he was the team’s “quarantine quarterback.” In doing such a weird job, Beane was happy with how Fromm handled it. “Jake Fromm had the most “un-normal year a player could have,” Beane said. “I thought he handled that greatly.” K Tyler Bass Just by the eye test, everyone saw that the rookie kicker struggled early. But the thing Beane liked about Tyler Bass was the way he “never made an excuse,” adding that in his career, he’s seen many other kickers do so. CB Dane Jackson The biggest rookie praise came for cornerback Dane Jackson. Beane already put him in the running for Buffalo’s No. 2 cornerback spot. “He’ll have every opportunity next year to not only win a spot, we’ll see who starts opposite of Tre (White),” Beane said. WR Gabe Davis Finally on his first-year wideout, Beane said he doesn’t want to overload Davis too quickly by calling him a No. 2 receiver just yet. But he did like the extended run Davis got when John Brown went down with injury later in the season. “I don’t want to put that on him but I don’t think Gabe is near his ceiling,” Beane said. “Thought he wasn’t a rookie by end of year because of how much he played.” Feelings on Matt Milano Some consider linebacker Matt Milano as the Bills’ biggest free agent fish to fry this offseason. His rookie contract is up and he will want to get paid. Like in the past, Beane said Milano has every right to go to free agency, but the GM did say the team wants him to return. “We’d love to be able to get Matt back, he knows that,” Beane said. But did Beane did give us kind of a glimpse into what could be a talking point in those contract talks. It’ll be Milano’s ability to stay on the field. “Matt is a very good player, what a great job he’s done since he’s come in here,” Beane said. “His biggest thing is being able to play 16 games.” In four seasons, the former fifth-round pick has played in 16 games once, while playing in 15 in 2019. In 2018 and 2020, respectively, he was held to 13 and 10 games played. In this most recent season, Milano suffered from hamstring and pectoral issues. Dawson on alert? Dawson Knox probably had his best game of the year against the Chiefs. But the bar was pretty low with the way Buffalo’s tight ends preformed throughout the season, When specifically asked about the tight end position, Beane said he wanted more. Not a good sign for Knox moving forward. “I thought it was up and down,” Beane said on the unit in general. “We just never really got position… at the end of the year I thought we did a little bit, Dawson started to get his groove a little bit, but it was never where the opposing defense was like, ‘Man we’ve really got to stop their tight ends from going off.'” Also probably some bad luck for Knox & Co. having to see Travis Kelce in Buffalo’s final game of the season…. Right side makeover? We mentioned the offensive line already, but specifically on the right side of it, we have Jon Feliciano and Daryl Williams . Those guys are pending free agents. Beane said he was happy with the bounce-backs of sorts both had. Feliciano was hurt early this season and in years prior, Williams dealt with injuries. However, bringing both back seems unlikely. “I don’t know, we’ll have to see where their markets are. If not, we’ll have to find some similar replacements at a cost-effective number,” Beane said. In consideration on that side will be Cody Ford as well. Because of Ford, do not expect both Feliciano and Williams to return because not only do the Bills seem to love him despite struggles and injuries, he fits that description. He’s already signed, therefore, he’s “cost effective.” Likes Matt Barkley No offense, Matt. But backup quarterback Matt Barkley is certainly not on top of the list of concerns for the Bills this offseason. The Bills do have other quarterbacks on the roster and again… he’s a backup. But it sounded like Beane likes him, so maybe there is a chance that he’s back? “Some guys are the backup and they’re itching to play. Matt’s a competitor, he wants to play, but his first thing every day when he walks through the door is to help Josh Allen be the best version of himself, that’s why it’s been so great to have him,” Beane said. No. 2 on Barkley’s mind is probably Bitcoin. Micah Hyde’s future While still under contract next season, Micah Hyde is entering the final year of his contract. Since the NFL salary cap is in such a mess right now, it might be hard to re-sign the safety right away. Keeping him around, considering Jordan Poyer got an extension last offseason would be smart. Beane could not commit to doing so because of the salary cap situation, but it does sound like he plans to try and make that happen… eventually. “I didn’t see any decline in Micah,” Beane said. “I’m a big fan of Micah Hyde.” Beane added he thinks Hyde will “still play for years in this league if he wants to.” Related 9 takeaways from Sean McDermott's end of season press conference Sammy Watkins clapped back at Bills fans after Chiefs' AFC title win Mel Kiper Jr. sends Bills dynamic RB Najee Harris in first 2021 mock draft Sean McDermott admits Bills should have gone for it on 4th down vs. Chiefs",30511.97,-0.08,30590.0,0.17,30403.9,-0.44,31246.74,2.32,30537.49

However, Adjusted EBITDA is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.
A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income can be found below in the table captioned “Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA.” Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income, adjusted to exclude provision for or benefit from income taxes, depreciation and amortization, interest (income) expense, stock-based compensation expense, impairment, investment income, fair value gain or loss on derivatives, non-recurring legal reserves and related costs, and other loss, net.
The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. Management’s determination of the components of Adjusted EBITDA are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by industry analysts. Net income attributable to Exodus stockholders is reconciled to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as follows:

23589,2018-03-18 18:09:00,Walmart Thinks You'll Pay $10 for Grocery Delivery,"The company that has long guaranteed customers ""everyday low prices"" may soon deliver sticker shock instead.
Walmart(NYSE: WMT)said this week that it will begin offering grocery delivery from more than 800 of its stores, partnering with services like Uber and Deliv to cover 40% of American households. But there's a big catch: The retail giant is charging customers $9.95 per delivery, more than virtually all of its competitors, with a minimum order of $30.
Image source: Walmart.
Walmart understands the need to update its grocery business to fend off competition fromAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN),Kroger, new entrants such as Aldi and Lidl, and others. The retail giant has already opened 1,200 grocery pickup stations at stores across the country, and expects to add another 1,000 this year. Those locations give customers the opportunity to place orders online and retrieve them later that day by pulling into a designated parking area, where store employees simply load the order into their car. There is no additional charge for pickup.
The program has clearly been popular, as the company is rapidly expanding it and considers it to be the biggest driver of its 44% growth in e-commerce last year.
However, its delivery strategy is more questionable. Walmart appears to have mastered the ability to put together orders efficiently (seeing as there is no charge for the online pickup service), so the delivery fee would seem to go entirely to the cost of transportation. Compared to Walmart's rivals, a $9.95 charge simply isn't competitive.
Amazon just said it would makefree two-hour deliveryavailable for Prime members from all Whole Foods locations by the end of the year.Instacart, the popular grocery delivery service, charges $5.99 for regular delivery on orders above $35, and $7.99 for one-hour delivery. With Instacart Express, customers can get unlimited regular deliveries for $149 a year.Target(NYSE: TGT), whichbought Shiptlate last year to step up its delivery game, offers free same-day delivery of groceries with an annual fee of $99.
Considering the lower-priced offers from its competitors and its own free pickup service, Walmart's new delivery service raises the question of which audience it is aimed at. Given that Walmart normally targets a lower-income customer, the upfront fee seems like a mistake and one that's likely to drive customers away.
Walmart points out that other delivery services like Instacart sometimes charge higher prices on the actual items that are delivered, but that may be a better strategy, as that would at least allow shoppers to see what they would save by visiting the store. It's worth noting that Walmart could partner with Instacart if it wanted to but it seems to want to retain control over the packaging even if it costs customers more.
Above all, this move seems like another attempt by Walmart to play catch-up with Amazon's Whole Foods delivery initiative. While Walmart and Whole Foods generally cater to opposite ends of the grocery spectrum, the two supermarket chains increasingly seem to be on a collision course: Amazon is seeking to lower prices and reach new customers, and Walmart is moving into organics and seeking a higher-end customers through Jet.com and its other new online brands. Offering delivery expands the geographic markets for both.
With an estimated 80 million American households already signed up for Prime, however, Amazon has the clear advantage. It can offer free two-hour delivery from Whole Foods, a well-respected brand -- and that service may persuade even more shoppers to join Prime. Walmart, on the other hand, is charging its normally thrifty customers a premium for delivery in as little as four hours. The Bentonville behemoth seems not to understand that grocery delivery is a loss leader -- table stakes to compete for a customer who'd rather not visit a store.
Walmart may want to find a way to make its delivery fee more competitive with its peers, if it wants the program to gain traction. Or it may want to consider scrapping the initiative altogether. As it stands, the considerable charge undermines the company's low-price reputation.

14045,2018-01-19 00:33:00,3 Top Energy Stocks to Buy Right Now,"The energy industry is in the midst of a tectonic shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewables, fueled by growing climate change worries and a dramatic drop in costs. Because of those factors, renewable energy companies are growing briskly and appear poised to continue doing so for years to come. Given the growth that's up ahead, now is a great time to buy clean energy stocks, withTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA),TerraForm Power(NASDAQ: TERP), andSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR)being three that we believe have the power to outperform from here.
Rich Smith(Tesla, Inc.):There's a non-zero chance that I'm going to regret this, but I think I'll pick Tesla as my top energy stock to buy right now. (And no,notjust becauseElon Musk is opening a roller rink).
Image source: Getty Images.
Rather, as I explained last week, I think there's a good chance2018 will be a breakout yearfor Tesla. First off, there's the thing that everybody knows about, and everybody is waiting for: Tesla's Model 3 sedan. Tesla's failure to get Model 3 produced at promised production rates weighed heavily on the stock last year. But now Musk has given himself another six months in which to try to get production unstuck. Given time, I think he'll succeed.
What interests me more about Tesla, though, is its role in energy infrastructure. Last year, Tesla succeeded in building a backup battery system for Australia for $50 million. It did so just in time to (a)win a bet that Musk made, and (b) head off not one, but at least two separate electricity blackouts before they could knock South Australia's grid offline.
Here in the U.S., power outages cost Americans an estimated $150 billion a year in spoiled food, lost productivity, damage to and from burst and frozen water pipes, and so on. If Tesla markets its new Powerpack utility-scale batteries as a solution to this problem, I see that as a strong argument in favor of more utilities -- not just abroad, but right here in the U.S. -- hiring Tesla to build them backup battery systems. At $50 million apiece, success in this one venture could make up for a lot of unsold Model 3s.
Matt DiLallo(TerraForm Power):Wind and solar power generator TerraForm Power has burned investors over the years, shedding nearly two-thirds of its value since going public in 2014. However, that's mainly because the focus of company's former parent was on expanding as quickly as possible no matter the cost instead of creating value for investors. Because of that, TerraForm issued mounds of new stock and debt to buy wind and solar facilities, often paying a high price for both capital and the assets it acquired.
However, those days of growing for the sake of growth are now in the rearview mirror after renowned value creatorBrookfield Asset Management(NYSE: BAM)took over management by purchasing a 51% stake in the company. Brookfield has already helped TerraForm Power craft a plan to generate value from its current portfolio of renewable power plants, while also putting the company on the pathway for sustainable growth.
That plan should see TerraFormreinstate a high-yield dividend this year, with it on pace to sustainably grow that payout by 5% to 8% annually over the next several years. Cost-savings initiatives will fuel most of that growth in the near term, while a combination of reinvesting its retained cash flow on high-return projects and targeting value-based acquisitions will also help drive cash flow and dividend growth in the coming years. It's a strategy that has the potential to generate double-digit total annual returns for investors, which makes TerraForm a great energy stock to buy now.

Travis Hoium(SunPower):It's become clear that solar energy is a disruptive force in energy and is already upending themultitrillion-dollar energy industry. Not only is solar energy competitive with fossil fuels today, it can be installed in places like rooftops that allow customers to own energy production, upending the utility business model.
One of the leaders in the solar industry is SunPower, the high-efficiency solar panel manufacturer. SunPower is a leader in rooftop solar with its industry-leading X-Series solar panels, which areover 22% efficient, and is nowattaching energy storage to up to 75% of new bookingsin some commercial markets. And management says residential energy storage will likely see similar adoption starting in late 2018. Financially, the high-efficiency rooftop solar business has been good for SunPower with margins between the mid-teens and mid-20% range. The reason the stock hasn't done better is the power plant business.
In power plants, SunPower has struggled to sell high-efficiency solar panels, which is where recent financial losses have come from, so it's changed its model and is making a product called P-Series that's built with commodity solar cells and assembled in a unique way to create a panel that'sslightly more efficient than competitors. When combined with a racking, design, and maintenance platform called Oasis, SunPower has a full offering that's gained traction with well-known utilities likeAESandNextEra Energy.
SunPower is well positioned as the premium solar panel provider in residential and commercial markets, and it has the opportunity to build a large power plant business with P-Series and Oasis. It's also trading at an incredible value with a price-to-sales ratio of just over 0.5, a depressed level because of losses in recent quarters. But if financials turn around in 2018, as management expects, SunPower has a lot of upside for investors, and that's why I think it's a great energy stock to buy now.

Fiscal 2018 sales improved 11.2% to a record $908.3 million. Earnings per share increased to $0.98 from $0.62 in the fourth quarter of last year. In the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter, the company recognized a tax benefit of $10.5 million, or $0.28 per share, related to foreign investment tax credits and a change in the provisional estimate related to U.S. tax reform.
For the year, earnings per share decreased to $1.52 from $2.48. In fiscal 2018, the company recognized a tax charge of $53.7 million, or $1.43 per share due to the enactment of the U.S. tax reform. The fourth quarter and year benefited from higher sales in the automotive and power product segments, increased international government grants and lower legal fees.
The full year also benefited from lower expense for stock award amortization and the gain from the sale of exclusive rights for a licensing agreement. The fourth quarter and year were negatively impacted by higher wages and compensation, travel and intangible asset amortization expense, increased investment in Dabir, customer price reductions, and unfavorable commodity pricing. The year was also negatively impacted by acquisition related expenses and purchase accounting adjustments, unfavorable currency impact and the absence of commodity pricing adjustments and one-time reversal of accruals in the automotive segment in fiscal 2017. Compared to last year, consolidated gross margins decreased 20 basis points in the fourth quarter to 24.9% and 30 basis points in the full year to 26.4%.
In both periods, margins were negatively impacted by sales mix related to newly acquired businesses in the automotive segment. Full-year margins were also negatively impacted by purchase accounting adjustments, unfavorable currency impact, price reductions, higher commodity pricing and the absence of the commodity pricing adjustments and reversal of customer commercial accruals in the automotive segment in fiscal 2017. However, in both periods, this was also partially offset by a favorable sales mix in the interface segment and higher sales volumes in the power product segment. Year over year, fiscal 2018 fourth-quarter selling and administrative expenses increased due primarily to expenses from new acquisitions and increased expenses for wages and travel.
This was partially offset by the absence of expense related to operating units exited at the end of fiscal 2017. For the full year, selling and administrative expenses increased year over year due mainly to M&A expense, selling and administrative expenses from acquisitions and higher wages and travel expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower legal and stock award expense and the absence of expense related to operating units exited at the end of fiscal 2017. Year over year, fiscal 2018 fourth-quarter pre-tax was $30.8 million, compared to $27.8 million in the previous year.
Fiscal 2018 pre-tax income was a record $123.8 million, compared $115.9 million in fiscal 2017. Fourth-quarter operating margin was 11.1% this year, compared to 11.8% in the fiscal 2017 fourth order. Fiscal 2018 operating margin was 13%, compared to 13.6% for fiscal 2017, mainly due to acquisition costs. Moving on to a review of our segment results.
Year over year, automotive segment sales increased 17.6% in the fourth quarter and 15.3% for the full year due to sales from Procoplast and Pacific Insight acquisitions, favorable currency impact, higher customer funded tooling and design fees and increased hidden switch sensor and user interface product volumes. In both periods, these improved sales were partially mitigated by lower transmission lead-frame assembly and steering angle sensor product volumes and price reductions. Year over year, automotive gross margins declined 180 basis points to 25.6% in the fourth quarter and 120 basis points to 27.7% for the year due to sales mix related to newly acquired businesses, unfavorable currency impact and price reductions. The full year was also negatively impacted by acquisition related purchase accounting adjustments and the absence of the commodity pricing adjustments and one-time reversal of accruals related to customer commercial issues which occurred last year.
Moving to interface. Year-over-year segment sales decreased 9.2% in the fourth quarter and 9.1% for the year, driven mainly by the exit of the Connectivity, which contributed $2.9 million in the fourth quarter and $15.5 million last year and decreased legacy product sales in Asia, which were $300,000 less in the fourth quarter and $1.4 million less for the year over fiscal 2017. In both periods, these decreases were partially offset by improved radio remote control sales. Compared to last year, interfaces gross margins increased 290 basis points to 21.7% in the fourth quarter and 90 basis points to 21.8% for the year due to improved radio remote control sales partially offset by price reductions.
Fourth-quarter gross margins were also negatively affected by an unfavorable currency impact. Fourth-quarter Hetronic litigation costs were $2.1 million this fiscal year, versus $2.8 million last year. In total, these costs were $8.1 million in fiscal 2018. We anticipate litigation costs to be $4 million to $5 million for fiscal 2019, with the majority to be incurred in the first half of the year, as we currently anticipate litigation ending in fiscal 2019.
In our power product segment, sales increased year over year by 12.2% in the fourth quarter due to higher PowerRail sales and busbar sales in North America and Asia. Segment results also improved year over year by 12.3% mainly due to higher power connector volume and increased busbar volume in Asia, partially offset by lower busbar volumes in North America. Year-over-year segment gross margins in the fourth quarter increased 240 basis points to 30.4% and 40 basis points for the year to 27.2%, primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by increased copper prices. As we announced in the release this morning, Methode anticipates fiscal 2019 sales in the range of $950 million to $970 million, pre-tax income in the range of $127 million to $134 million, and earnings per share in the range of $2.81 to $2.96.
Fiscal 2019 guidance considers price reductions of approximately $14 million on purchase displays negotiated by a customer in the automotive segment as discussed last quarter, a significant amount of previously announced automotive new business not launching until late fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the delayed launch to fiscal 2020 of a laundry program in the interface segment which results in lower than anticipated revenues of $7 million in fiscal 2019, and pre-tax expense of approximately $6.5 million for initiatives to reduce overall costs and improve operational profitability, with most of that expense to be incurred in the first three quarters. The guidance ranges for fiscal 2019 are based upon management's expectations regarding a variety of factors and involve a number of risks and uncertainties which have been detailed in this morning's release and Form 10-K. I want to talk briefly about the expenses we will occur this year to reduce overall costs and improve operational profitability and margins. As a matter of practice, Methode develops and undertakes initiatives that enable us to serve our customers better at lower operating costs.
Among other benefits, rationalizing our expenses increases our cash flow, which enables us to make investment that can have a positive impact on our growth. These actions are designed to improve efficiency while reducing organizational complexity. At this time, I am unable to provide any more details on this initiative but will do so on our second-quarter call. Before moving on to new business wins, I want to provide some insight as where we currently stand in our 2020 EBITDA target with the start of fiscal 2020 now approximately 10 months away.
First, the expenses associated with the Hetronic litigation, which we currently expect to end this year, as well as the initiatives to reduce overall costs and improve operational profitability will not reoccur in fiscal 2020. Additionally, we see the benefits from these cost initiatives next year plus a full year of the new automotive programs launching late in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year and the benefit of the launch of the delayed laundry program previously discussed and a significant increase in our eBike business and sales growth in our Dabir, Hetronic and power businesses, all of which would contribute to a successful 2020. As far as new business in the fourth quarter, leveraging our expertise in overhead consoles and our TouchSensor technology, we booked an overhead console, or roof module as it's known in Europe, with Volkswagen for average annual revenue of $16 million for six years beginning in fiscal 2021. This overhead console encompasses not only the typical LED lighting, ambient lighting, switches, and roof slider, but also an integrated digital microphone.
Additionally, our European automotive group booked hidden and ergonomics works programs for premium vehicles for $2.5 million in average annual revenue for five years beginning in fiscal 2020 and another $1.5 million average annual revenue for five years beginning in 2021. In interface, our TouchSensor team, a supplier to Coca-Cola for over 15 years, was awarded the integrated lighting on Coca-Cola soda dispensing machines designed to attract customers and offer unique look. Launching later this fiscal year and running for several years, this backlit brand label's the first of several lighting-only opportunities that TouchSensor group is pursuing coordination with our Pacific Insight division. Now let's move on with an update on Dabir.
Since the third quarter, Dabir added two new health system customers for a hospital in Greenville health system. Additionally, successful clinical evaluations were completed at six hospital sites and new clinical evaluations began at five others. Dabir now has extensive experience managing clinical evaluations in critical care units, diagnostics areas, MedSurg units and a variety of perioperative specially areas including cardiovascular, neurology, transplant, colorectal, plastic, oncology and post-anesthesia care. The 2018 conference season kicked off this spring with Dabir participating in several national congresses including the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses and the -American Organization of Nurse Executives.
Dabir's chief clinical officer delivered continuing education units to over 300 OR nurses at eight sessions entitled pressure injury prevention throughout the continuum of perioperative patient care. These continuing education sessions enable Dabir to drive collaboration with the customers and prospects and more sessions are scheduled. Dabir's publication strategy is on tired target delivering a peer-reviewed special report on pressure injury prevention last month. Now I will turn the call over to Ron who will give further details regarding our financial results.
Ronald L.G. Tsoumas--Vice President of Corporate Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Don. Good morning everyone. I have a few brief comments on the quarter and full-year period. Before I begin my commentary, I want to clarify that my comments include seven months and nine months of results for our acquisitions of Pacific Insight and Procoplast respectively.
The company's effective tax rate was 54% for the fiscal year ended 2018 based on a tax expense of approximately $67 million. This higher tax expense was a result of a few significant events that occurred during the year. First, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017.
This resulted in a total tax reform charge of approximately $54 million, or $1.43 per share, for the year. This charge is comprised of two components. The tax toll charge of $49 million, which was primarily related to accumulated overseas profits, and the remaining $5 million was due to the remeasurement of net deferred-tax assets. In addition, the company recorded a discrete tax benefit of $7.4 million related to investment tax credits resulting from a tax law change in a foreign jurisdiction which occurred in the fourth quarter.
U.S. tax reform reduces the statutory U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to a blended 30% for 2018 and will further be reduced to 21% for fiscal year 19 and beyond. For the fourth quarter, the company reported an effective tax rate benefit of 19%.
This was primarily driven by the benefit from the tax law change in the foreign jurisdiction of $7.4 million and a tax expense reduction to the provisional estimate for U.S. tax reform of $3.1 million. The two adjustments combined to $10.5 million, or $0.28 per share. Without these two discrete tax items, the fourth-quarter tax rate would have been 14.6%.
For the full year of fiscal 2018, the company's effective tax rate excluding the impact of tax reform charge and the foreign tax law benefit mentioned above would have been 16.4%. The provisional estimates and the adjustments in the fourth quarter of tax reform were based on the company's preliminary analysis. The changes included in tax reform are very broad and complex. The final impacts of the tax reform may differ from the amounts estimated thus far due to, among other things, changes in the interpretation of the tax reform act and legislative guidance.
The company currently anticipates finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments within the one year allotted remeasurement period which will occur in the third quarter of our fiscal 2019. We anticipate that our effective tax rate will normalize for fiscal year 2019 and we estimate the full-year effective tax rate to be in the range of 16% and 18%. Turning our attention to SG&A. You will note that in the fourth quarter SG&A, including intangible amortization, as a percentage of sales was 13.8%, as compared to 13.3% in the prior year, or an increase of $5 million.
During the quarter, we had increases of $3.8 million of selling and administrative costs and $1.4 million of intangible amortization from our new acquisitions. We also experienced increases in wages and travel of $1.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The increases were partially offset by the absence of $900,000 of expense related to our connectivity and active energy systems reporting units exited in Q4 of fiscal 2017 and lower legal and stock-based compensation expense of $500,000 and $400,000, respectively. For the full year of fiscal 2018 SG&A, including intangible amortization, as a percentage of sales was 13.3%, as compared to 13.2% one year ago, or $13.8 million higher.
This was driven primarily of $6.8 million of acquisition-related expenses, $9.4 million of additional selling and administrative expenses from our two acquisitions, and $3.3 million of associated intangible amortization. We also incurred increases in wages and travel of $7.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The increase was offset in part by the $6.9 million reversal of performance-based stock awards in 3Q, lower legal fees of $2.8 million, and the absence of $3.8 million of expense related to our connectivity and active energy reporting units which we exited in fiscal 2017 fourth quarter. Moving to capital expenditures.
In fiscal 2018, we invested $47.7 million, which was in line with our previous guidance of $44 million to $48 million. We are estimating our capital investment for fiscal 2019 to be in the $52 million to $58 million range. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal 2018 was $28.1 million, which was in line with our guidance of $28 million to $30 million. For fiscal year 2019, we expect depreciation and amortization to be between $34 million and $36 million.
Shifting to EBITDA. The company generated $39.5 million in the fourth quarter, or 15.9% of sales. For fiscal 2018, EBITDA was $152.8 million, or 16.8% of sales. For fiscal 2019, we expect EBITDA to be between $161 million and $170 million, or in the 16.5% to 17.5% of sales range.
Free cash flow for fiscal 2018 was stated at $37.6 million. Adjusting for the $53.7 million tax reform charge and the discrete foreign tax credit of $7.4 million, free cash flow would have been $84 million. Please note that the transition tax for U.S. tax reform is payable over an eight-year period and is back-loaded.
We expect fiscal 2019 free cash flow to be between $85 million and $90 million. Don, that concludes my comments.

OK. At this time we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Christopher Van Horn with B. Riley FBR.
Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Van Horn--B. Riley FBR -- Analyst
Good morning. Thanks for taking the call.
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Christopher Van Horn--B. Riley FBR -- Analyst
I was hoping you could comment on Procoplast and Pacific Insight and where we are in the integration and kind of your vision of getting to kind of improving the margin structure there and getting it more into the Methode line of margins? And then maybe comment on any revenue or cost synergies that you see really you can take advantage of?
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. We are knee-deep in integrating the back-office functions where we see some near-term benefits from that. Most of the action we are taking are on our deck for this year. Procoplast, in particular, we need to get the cost of quality in line with ours and we are taking significant actions to do that and I would anticipate that we will make significant progress this year with them.
Without being specific to customers, Procoplast has their ongoing customer relationships, has afforded us a number of RFQs, nothing that we won but certainly, we are seeing more opportunities there than that we would have without Procoplast. So that is proceeding as planned and integral to our earnings this year and also to 2020. Moving on to Pacific Insight, I would say the same. That's a larger operation.
So there is much more going on in the production areas which Methode excels at. I think the team has identified a number of areas that they can reduce costs in. We do have to be sensitive to our customers. They have to approve the changes we want to make as we do in any of our automotive lines.
So that's proceeding. We are seeing more opportunities with them. I talked about TouchSensor. That's a minor win, but it does demonstrate that our teams are working together gain business.
Pacific Insight has been slightly impacted by some of the changes at Ford. And we have taken that into account. They are much more heavily weighted toward passenger cars. Right now they did win the F-150, but that hasn't launched yet.
So they have been affected by that and we pretty much took that into account when we looked at their projections and when we priced the purchase of that. So there are really no surprises there but we did have to take that into our guidance. But, again, I would say that's going as planned. So in summary, that is our mission in fiscal 2019 is to get them to our standard margins because while they are impacting positively our income and our sales, they are affecting margins because of the mix there.
Christopher Van Horn--B. Riley FBR -- Analyst
Got it. Thanks for all the detail there. And then from a macro perspective, have you guys looked at the potential and I know it's early and I know we don't really anything done yet, but have you looked at the potential impact of a NAFTA tariff or in addition, have you looked at any impact from the Chinese tariffs as well?
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Well, from a macro level we have. We really have to wait for the fine print on all of those from a tariff standpoint. We have sketched out contingency plans but it really will be dictated, Chris, by our customers. They will tell us what they want us to do.
And that's all I can comment on. It's just really sales. We just have to wait and see what happens. NAFTA, again, we operate as maquila.
So there is some benefit there, but again if the tariffs are put on then that would affect us as well. But that's about as far as I can go with that.
Christopher Van Horn--B. Riley FBR -- Analyst
OK. Got it. And then lastly for me. The radio remote control had some good strength in the quarter.
Could you just comment on what you are seeing on there? And then maybe a little bit of a follow-on. It seems like transmission leadframe volumes are declining in both Asia and North America. And I just wondered, was that a program roll-off and are there opportunities maybe to, if that is the case, are there opportunities to backfill that? Thanks.
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Let me answer that one first. That leadframe goes into passenger car transmission. So we are going to be at the mercy of what the customers and we are Tier 2 on that to Continental.
So that's going to ebb and flow with pass cars. That has that not been announced but that's going end-of-life. It's been on the long run. Transmission program has run a long time, but that's just normal fluctuations in business.
But there are also some price reductions in there to, which off the top of my head, I don't recall what those were, that contributed to a decline there. But we have seen that in the past. As far as Hetronic, I have to give the Hetronic team a plug here because they have done an excellent job of reducing their costs, introducing new products, reducing their inventory and probably most importantly, reducing the lead time. And that's key in that business.
If you have a $0.5 million piece of machinery that you want to ship and you don't have radio remote control for it, well, you can't ship it but our team has jumped through hoops to improve dramatically, improve their on-time delivery plus shorten their lead times and that translates into more business. Because those customers, they will pay the prices that we offer because of the lead time. It's not a pricing issue, it's a lead time issue often times and so I think the team has done an excellent job in that business and we are seeing that. And we believe we are going to continue to see it going forward.
Christopher Van Horn--B. Riley FBR -- Analyst
OK. Great. Thanks for the time.
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer

Our next question is from David Leiker with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please proceed.
David Leiker--Robert W. Baird & Company -- Analyst
Hi. good morning, everyone.
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, David.
David Leiker--Robert W. Baird & Company -- Analyst
So some of this has been answered, but if you look at the automotive business, organically you are down 7%. How much of that can be attributed to the leadframe business?
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
We can get you that number. I don't want to guess, but I don't want to say it's significant but we would have to calculate that number.
David Leiker--Robert W. Baird & Company -- Analyst
OK. Because the product question I was going to ask is, if you could fill in the blanks or details a little bit of that organic growth being negative 7% where you have been running mid to upper single digits here and then what that swing factor was in Q4?
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
I am hesitating because I don't want to get in the customer specifics. I am trying to figure out how to answer that. Let's talk about Asia. Our steering angle sensor business was down there just as a result of customer demand.
And then overall, our North American business was down with Europe being up. But Dave, I can't get into specifics because I would end up talking about customer volumes and so on. But that's really, Europe was up, Asia is down because of steering angle sensors and as also mentioned leadframes and just U.S. volumes were less.
David Leiker--Robert W. Baird & Company -- Analyst
Let me come at it this way. So if we looked at and for the sounds of it, it seems these are more customer mix- or product mix-related issues than business that's running off or new business that's slow to launch? Is that fair?
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. It is, as I have often said, we cannot affect revenues other than to ship everything a customer wants in a given fiscal year. We are booking now for really 2021. So yes, it is demand.
And the price reductions go into effect the first of the year. So you have to take into account price reductions at the beginning of the calendar year. So all of that contributed to where we are.
David Leiker--Robert W. Baird & Company -- Analyst
OK. As we look at the 2019 guidance, you male the comment, I am going to throw out the three things here and you can just fill in the blanks here. But you were talking about the automotive launches are back-end loaded in the year. Is that what they always were? Or have those been pushed back a bit?
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
No. We went back and tracked and those have always been late in the year.
David Leiker--Robert W. Baird & Company -- Analyst
OK. The laundry?
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
We will see the benefit of them in 2020.
David Leiker--Robert W. Baird & Company -- Analyst
OK. And then the laundry --
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
When I say late in the year, I mean --
David Leiker--Robert W. Baird & Company -- Analyst
OK. And then on the laundry side --
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
That was a delay by the customer. We didn't lose any business. They just and not for any Methode or TouchSensor reasons, the customer delayed the launch. And so we are that occurred in our fourth quarter.
David Leiker--Robert W. Baird & Company -- Analyst
And then on the cost actions you are taking. It sounds like these are actions that are beyond what you would normally do for your typical cost reduction to offset price downs. Can you just give a little background on what you are doing there and what's precipitated it?
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
As I said, I really don't want to comment on specific actions because we are still sorting through exactly how we will implement some of those but those are across the board. As we look at our businesses, we have acquired companies, we have exited companies, we felt that as we wind down the launch of a major program we looked at to how should we adjust our expenses, is probably a good way of putting it going forward. And we do want to reduce the complexity of Methode. You have seen us exit a couple of businesses.
So that's what that's geared to and we will see the benefit of that in 2020.
David Leiker--Robert W. Baird & Company -- Analyst
OK. And then one last item. I appreciate the comments you made as it relates to 2020. If I recall correctly, last quarter, maybe the quarter before, that's a $200 million EBITDA number.
It would seem to me like that's still intact. Or is that something that we need to be looking at adjusting?
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
No. That's really why I made that comment. I always give the disclaimer that it depends on what the auto market does and what the economy does, but we anticipate the lawsuit ending. We are not going to reoccur the initiatives we just talked about.
So there's a number of things that, if you do the math, gets close to that number. And then we have to execute, of course, on improved sales, but it's not much of a gap as one might initially look at.
David Leiker--Robert W. Baird & Company -- Analyst
Well, it seems from the announcement that you have made over the last several years, most of the revenue that you need for that has already been booked in contract. So it's just a matter of some of these exogenous things, mix and build rates and things like that.
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
What's very interesting about the automotive business is that normally there is a predictability to it. You get some fluctuations based on the customer demands but our job for 2020 is to launch everything successfully, watch our expenses and then we do need to grow our non-automotive businesses which right now we are doing quite well. As I mentioned earlier to Christopher, l am very pleased with what Hetronic is doing and power is having a very good year and Dabir our mission this year is to get multiple hospitals in our health system. So there is work to do but we are feeling very good about that.
David Leiker--Robert W. Baird & Company -- Analyst
And then just to close the loop on all of this, it sounds like the actions that you are taking now looking to 2020 are to help to offset some of these mix related issues that are headwinds. So that jump from 2019 to 2020, part of it is already booked, the other part, some of these cost actions fill the gap that you are missing right now on the guidance?
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. I couldn't say it better.
David Leiker--Robert W. Baird & Company -- Analyst
OK. Thank you.
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.

Our next question is from David Wetherell with Oberweis Asset Management. Please proceed with your question.
David Wetherell--Oberweis Asset Management -- Analyst
Good morning gentlemen. Thank you very much for your time and for taking the call this morning. I just have one very quick question and that is related to the price reduction scheme. Without going into any detail, of course, with respect to terms of your contracts with your customers, do you get the sense, do you believe that you have seen increased purchase volumes and will see increased purchase volumes as a result of the price concessions you have given?
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
That's a very good question. The automakers don't, as a matter of practice, tie cost reductions to new business. You have to remain what is referred to as green from a number of aspects. You have to be launching well, be supporting the factories and routinely giving them cost reductions or price reduction opportunities and that's a heated negotiation every year, but in the end, why we do that is that we want to say in the favorable graces of the automakers.
And so we plan for that in our operations and generally it gets much harder toward the tail end of the program. We have been able to offset that with cost reductions in our own factories. That's probably all I can say, if you don't do it, we are not going to book more business and that's, as I just said to David, one of the nice things about automotive is its predictability. One of the things that's not so nice is there is constant pressure for price reductions.
And that's just part and parcel of being in the automotive business.
David Wetherell--Oberweis Asset Management -- Analyst
No. That's very helpful color. Thank you very much. Let me ask just one more related to that, if you don't mind, because your answer is a little bit of a question.
I was curious whether there is relationship building as well with that maintaining the positive relationship with the automakers and those price reductions, can you tell whether you believe it's tied more to the customers seeing competitive pressures across the industry or the fact that Methode has been hitting these very positive benchmarks along the way?
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
I have been asked that question before. That pressure is constant and it is high pressure. So in good times the automakers looking for through the same reductions in bad times. As I said, it's a fact of life in auto and for the most part, we have good relationships with our customers, but it does get a little difficult when you are looking at price reduction because that takes the topline and the bottomline.
Those are painful. I don't know about more I can say. I suppose in certain instances there is more pressure, but for the most part, I would say it's constant and it's intense.
David Wetherell--Oberweis Asset Management -- Analyst
OK. So is it fair to say that the pricing reductions you have seen this year is in line with what you see on an annual basis?
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, absolutely. We did comment last quarter and I commented in our prepared remarks is that one of our customers in North America negotiated a price reduction on displays. We don't make the display itself. We become what, that's actually the display supplier becomes what's called a directed sub to us but then since that's part of our cost of goods sold, that price reduction is passed directly through to the customer.
So in this instance, we saw $14 million less revenue, not because of really anything in the marketplace or anything because of Methode, it's just the price reduction that the automaker received. So we do get those occasionally and I think the prior year was $25 million, if I remember it correctly. So that's the other thing we take into account, not so much from a bottom-line standpoint, but from a topline. So you get the cost reductions and I think I said, they are average for an auto supplier plus occasionally you get something like that and we usually call that out as far up in advance as we can.
David Wetherell--Oberweis Asset Management -- Analyst
OK. Thank you very much. I sincerely appreciate your time again and the color you have offered on that. That's all I had.
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.

Our next question is from Steve Dyer with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please proceed.
Ryan Sigdahl--Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst
Hi, guys. It's Ryan Sigdahl, on for Steve. Just a couple of quick ones for us. You mentioned the Coke award.
I didn't catch. Did you give how big that award is?
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
No. I didn't. As I was reading that I realized we didn't. It's sub $1 million.
I just wanted to mention it because, one, it's Coca-Cola. It is, also involves our Pacific Insight group working with TouchSensor and we see that as an avenue for our TouchSensor group to garner more business. But it's sub $1 million. It will run five, six, seven years, as I would expect.
Ryan Sigdahl--Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst
And is there opportunity to grow it then? I know you said, I mean Coke is obviously big, $1 million a year. Do you think you can grow that pretty meaningfully or is that the endgame there?
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
No. I believe it can. That's really why I mentioned it. A good collaboration with the two groups, I like that.
And just as lighting in the vehicle is very important today, point-of-sale is important and it's not necessarily easy to do and if you look at the interior of a vehicle, you need uniform lighting. Well, point-of-sale, it's very challenging too. That's not something that you can go to a third-party that doesn't have expertise in lighting and just have them put some LEDs in the display. So you are right, we should be able to grow that area and again that's why I mentioned it.
Ryan Sigdahl--Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst
All right. And then you guys have had an international government grant. So do you expect anything in fiscal 2019?
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
We apply for them. And we have had two years in a row, I believe. But that's something I can't guarantee because really we are dealing with a government entity and that's not an exact science, let's put it that way. But we certainly apply for it.
Ryan Sigdahl--Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst
So safe to assume, nothing is included in guidance. That would be incremental upside there?
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. It would.
Ryan Sigdahl--Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst
All right. Lastly, digging into the 2020 EBITDA target, $200 million. Don, you mentioned the need to grow non-auto business. Previously Dabir was a big part of that plan, but it seems like there is a bigger emphasis on power, Hetronic etc.
now. Have expectations been lowered for Dabir and then offset by the other stuff? Or is the ramp still as it was before there? Thanks.
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. I would say that's equal. We mentioned power and Hetronic, I was thinking TouchSensor for a second, because they have had the issues in the past and we have taken corrective actions, both from a management standpoint and internally I spend a lot of time on Hetronic a few minutes ago. So us emphasizing them does not diminish Dabir.
It's just that those are integral to our plan and now they are starting to hit their stride and it was worth talking about. Dabir, this is a pivotal year for Dabir in that it needs to penetrate multiple hospitals in a system. The team has done a good job of one hospital that we just talked about Florida hospital. Well, there is a number of hospitals in that system.
We need to go beyond just having one hospital. So this is a critical year for Dabir. But if we going to 2020 and we are not where we need to be on Dabir, we have other contingencies there, but I don't mean to deemphasize Dabir, but I thought it was appropriate we talk about these other groups.
Ryan Sigdahl--Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst
Great. And then actually one last one. Just to confirm that 2020 target of $200 million, that's an organic number, right?
Donald W. Duda--Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. That's all organic, yes.
Ryan Sigdahl--Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst
All right. Thanks, guys. Good luck.

Ethereum’s broken beyond $140, might take $150 before the day is through. Bitcoin Cash is right behind it. It’s green everywhere you look. Even Bitcoin SV is on the rebound, resting at $68 after $155 million in trades.
Of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, only 4 were showing a negative 24-hour change. One was Paxos Standard. We should expect a high amount of conversions to be going on with stablecoins today, a lot of turbulence in the market capitalization, as people get their money into various cryptos on the ride up.
The other three were something called Aurora, Power Ledger, and and Ark. Collectively they had less than $50 million in 24-hour volume, and Ark was the only big loser, dropping 14%. This likely has to do with people cashing out for Bitcoin or Ethereum, trying to catch the wave. They might come back when prices stabilize or begin to drop, or they might not. We’re only noting these four cryptos because they stand out as the day’s losers.
Let’s take a selection from the cream of the crop.

• Production for the month totaled 12.76 Bitcoin
• Total Bitcoin holdings were 74.81
• Operations achieved 140.0 BTC/EH efficiency
Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - September 8, 2022) - Sphere 3D Corp.  (NASDAQ: ANY) (""Sphere 3D"" or the ""Company""), dedicated to becoming the leading carbon-neutral Bitcoin mining company operating at an industrial scale, provides results of its Bitcoin mining operation as of August 31, 2022.
CEO Comments
""We continue to maximize the performance of our highly efficient fleet of S19j Pros. The fleet again achieved very high BTC/EHs efficiency and maintained average uptimes at the top of industry averages. For the past several months, our fleet performed as well as, or better than, most fleets in the industry.
""During the month, 540 S19j Pros were delivered and installed at Compute North's Wolf Hollow site in Granbury, Texas. These miners are expected to be energized as the Granbury site comes online in phases. An additional 540 miners were released from U.S. Customs on August 31, 2022, which are being shipped to Texas. These shipments of approximately 1,080 miners are part of an order of 4,000 S19j Pros delayed by U.S. Customs, pending our supplier providing appropriate documentation.
""We are in the final stages of securing shipment of the remaining miners, but exact delivery dates have not been confirmed. The Sphere 3D team is working diligently with U.S. Customs, the supplier, our customs brokers, and the Compute North team to expedite delivery and get these miners energized as soon as possible. Bitmain Logistics is also assisting with the issue using insights gained from helping other customers overcome similar delays.
""Our discussions with FuFu Technologies Ltd. (BitFuFu) to renegotiate our September 21, 2021 contract to acquire 60,000 S19j Pros from Bitmain have been productive. We recently reached an agreement in principle on several critical points of the renegotiated agreement. Specifics will be announced if and when a new agreement is finalized.""
Bitcoin Production and Holdings Update
During the month ended August 31, 2022, Sphere 3D's mining operation produced 12.76 Bitcoin, or average daily production of 0.41 Bitcoin. Sphere 3D's mining fleet operated at 140.0 BTC/EH efficiency in August and averaged approximately 90 percent uptime. Daily production volume remained flat compared to July 2022. The equivalent approximate value of the Company's production, based on a Bitcoin price of $20,019 on August 31, 2022, totaled $255,000 for the month.
Since the Company began its mining operations during the first quarter of 2022, it has produced 80.81 Bitcoin, and as of August 31, 2022, held 74.81 Bitcoin. This represented a fair market value of about $1.50 million based on the Bitcoin price of $20,019 on August 31, 2022. As of August 31, 2022, the Company was operating approximately 1,000 S19j Pros miners delivering production capacity of approximately 100 PH/s.
The Company continues to employ a HODL strategy for the majority of its holdings. The difference between Bitcoin mined and Sphere '3D's holdings is the amount Sphere 3D used to fund working capital.

Accordingly, locals can use a Chivo wallet app on their phones to make purchases and manage their funds.
The government has been eager to give itself a good start. President Nayib BukelerevealedEl Salvador had bought 550 Bitcoin as of this writing (about $26 million), and the country's Congress passed a law last week establishing a $150 million fund to aid conversions from Bitcoin to US dollars (also accepted in El Salvador).
Bukele previously claimed the move would not only foster investment, tourism and overall economic development, but would make El Salvador's financial system more inclusive by courting the 70 percent of residents who don't have bank accounts. It's also an acknowledgment of the financial reality of the country. Its economy relies in part on remittances from migrants, and Bitcoin theoretically streamlines those transfers.
Not everyone is thrilled with the decision, though.Cointelegraphnotedthat some Salvadorans have protested the adoption of Bitcoin, arguing that politicians didn't consult with the public. They're also worriedcryptocurrency's volatilitycould pose a serious risk next to the relative stability of the US dollar.Reutersaddedthat police briefly held an outspoken critic of the Bitcoin law, Mario Gomez. Officials said it was related to a financial fraud investigation, but supporters were concerned this was an act of intimidation meant to silence political opposition.
We wouldn't count on other countries rushing to join El Salvador. Countries like the US are exploringcentral bank cryptocurrencies, potentially more stable and easily regulated than Bitcoin. Other countries are hostile. China banned many companies and institutions from handling cryptocurrency, and India has looked intobanning private currencies.

28268,2018-04-23 13:03:58,"Trump's revenge - U.S. oil floods Europe, hurting OPEC and Russia","By Olga Yagova and Libby George MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - As OPEC's efforts to balance the oil market bear fruit, U.S. producers are reaping the benefits - and flooding Europe with a record amount of crude. Russia paired with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last year in cutting oil output jointly by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd), a deal they say has largely rebalanced the market and one that has helped elevate benchmark Brent prices (LCOc1) close to four-year highs. Now, the relatively high prices brought about by that pact, coupled with surging U.S. output, are making it harder to sell Russian, Nigerian and other oil grades in Europe, traders said. ""U.S. oil is on offer everywhere,"" said a trader with a Mediterranean refiner, who regularly buys Russian and Caspian Sea crude and has recently started purchasing U.S. oil. ""It puts local grades under a lot of pressure."" U.S. oil output is expected to hit 10.7 million bpd this year, rivalling that of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia. In April, U.S. supplies to Europe are set to reach an all-time high of roughly 550,000 bpd (around 2.2 million tonnes), according to the Thomson Reuters Eikon trade flows monitor. (GRAPHIC: U.S. crude oil and condensate supply to Europe - https://reut.rs/2F8xk0k ) In January-April, U.S. supplies jumped four-fold year-on-year to 6.8 million tonnes, or 68 large Aframax tankers, according to the same data. Trade sources said U.S. flows to Europe would keep rising, with U.S. barrels increasingly finding homes in foreign refineries, often at the expense of oil from OPEC or Russia. In 2017, Europe took roughly 7 percent of U.S. crude exports, Reuters data showed, but the proportion has already risen to roughly 12 percent this year. Top destinations include Britain, Italy and the Netherlands, with traders pointing to large imports by BP, Exxon Mobil and Valero. (GRAPHIC: U.S. crude oil and condensate supplies to Europe in 2017-2018 by destination - https://reut.rs/2F9lWRO ) Story continues Polish refiners PKN Orlen and Grupa Lotos and Norway's Statoil are sampling U.S. grades, while other new buyers are likely, David Wech of Vienna-based JBC Energy consultancy said. ""There are a number of customers who still may test U.S. crude oil,"" Wech said. The gains for U.S. suppliers could come as a welcome development for U.S. President Donald Trump, who accused OPEC on Friday of ""artificially"" boosting oil prices. ""Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea. Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!"" Trump wrote on Twitter. 'KEY SUPPLY SOURCE' While the United States lifted its oil export ban in late 2015, the move took time to gain traction among Europe's traditional refineries, which were slow to diversify away from crude from the North Sea, West Africa and the Caspian. ""European refiners started experimenting with U.S. crude last year,"" said Ehsan Ul-Haq, director of London-based consultancy Resource Economics. ""Now, they know more than enough to process this crude."" U.S. oil gained in popularity, sources said, in part because of the wide gap between West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, and dated Brent, which is more expensive and sets the price for most of the world's crude grades. This gap, known as the Brent/WTI spread, has averaged $4.46 per barrel this year, nearly twice as high as the year-earlier figure, Reuters data showed. (CL-LCO1=R) Wech of JBC Energy said the spread would likely persist in the near future. The most popular U.S. grades in Europe are WTI, Light Louisiana Sweet, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Mars. Prices for alternative local grades have been slashed as a result. CPC Blend differentials recently hit a six-year low versus dated Brent at minus $2 a barrel. Russia's Urals also came under pressure despite the end of seasonal refinery maintenance. (BFO-CPC) (BFO-URL-E) (BFO-URL-NWE) WTI was available at 80-90 cent premiums delivered to Italy's Augusta, well below offers of Azeri BTC at a premium of $1.60 a barrel, according to trading sources. (BFO-AZR). U.S. oil is even edging out North Sea Forties, which is produced in the backyard of the continent's refineries. Cargoes of WTI were offered in Rotterdam at premiums of around 50-60 cents a barrel above dated Brent, cheaper than Forties' premium of 75 cents to dated.

This initiative encompasses services including Wallet enablement, card issuing, merchant settlement, on-chain remittances, and the enhancement of payment and commerce applications.
The payments giant has forged partnerships with crypto-native companies such as MetaMask, Kraken, Gemini, Bybit, Crypto.com, Binance, Monavate, and Bleap.
These collaborations enable consumers to utilise stablecoins in their crypto wallets for payments and to earn rewards through traditional cards at Mastercard-accepting merchant locations worldwide.
Additionally, Mastercard Move allows for the withdrawal of stablecoins into bank accounts.
In collaboration with OKX, Mastercard is launching the OKX Card, granting customers access to their funds and exploring new avenues to engage with digital assets.
This partnership leverages OKX's expertise in crypto trading and the Web3 ecosystem to onboard more users into the digital asset space.
Mastercard is also partnering with Nuvei and Circle to offer merchants the option to receive payments in stablecoins such as Circle’s USDC, and is working with Paxos to extend this functionality across Paxos-issued stablecoins.
The Mastercard Crypto Credential initiative addresses user experience challenges by enabling crypto exchange users to transact digital assets using usernames.
Companies such as Wirex, Bit2Me, Lirium, Notabene, Coins.ph, and Mercado Bitcoin have already integrated into the Mastercard Crypto Credential ecosystem.
The Mastercard Multi-Token Network (MTN) is designed to facilitate real-time payments and redemptions, allowing partners like Ondo Finance to utilise on-chain tokenised assets.
JPMorgan Chase and Standard Chartered have connected to MTN, linking deposit accounts to digital asset applications.
Mastercard chief product officer Jorn Lambert said: “We believe in the potential of stablecoins to streamline payments and commerce across the value chain. Unlocking this is core to how we navigate the rapidly changing world, giving people and businesses the freedom they want by providing the choices they deserve.”
This follows Mastercard's introduction of a new programme toaccelerate the adoption of virtual cardsto ease commercial payments between banks, platforms, and corporates.

33163,2018-05-25 20:31:50,First Bitcoin Mining Conference Hashes Over the High Cost of Energy,"Bitcoin mining uses as much electricity as Ireland, and by the end of 2018, the Bitcoin network will be using as much energy as Austria, according to a newreportby Alex de Vries of the Experience Center of PwC in the Netherlands.
Billed as the first serious, peer-reviewed study of energy use in crypto mining, the report has set off alarm bells, adding to current concerns about the impact of future mining energy consumption on environmental issues like climate change.
At the first-everconferencefor crypto mining, held on May 17, 2018, in New York City, an expert panel hashed out the implications of rapidly growing energy consumption among miners worldwide.
Amber D. Scott, CEO ofOutlier Solutions, moderated a panel of experts that spoke about the energy issue as part of a discussion on the topic of proof of work (PoW) vs. proof of stake (PoS).
Scott toldBitcoin Magazinethat there was a lot of discussion at the conference about the new energy report in part due to the attention it’s currently receiving in the press.
“This is an area where there is a spectacular amount of FUD [fear, uncertainty and doubt],” she noted. “This is in part because it’s a nuanced issue that can’t be summed up in simple statements about net energy consumption.
“I think that part of the reason that Bitcoin has been a ‘target’ in this respect is that there are relatively straightforward calculations in terms of power consumption in conjunction with the underlying value not being well understood or widely accepted. For instance, few people question the utility costs of a bank or ATM, and the energy consumption cannot be calculated in a straightforward way,” she added.
Scott Howard, CEO and co-founder of Toronto-basedePIC Blockchain Technologies, told the conference audience what many there were already saying: that the energy consumption issue is “fake news” and has been oversimplified to suit Bitcoin opponents.
Traditional banking and fiat creation have their own high energy costs, noted a number of conference panelists, including Alex Petrov, CIO ofBitfury; Jan Čapek, CEO ofSlush Pool; Samson Mow, CSO ofBlockstream; and Howard.
They talked about the high infrastructure costs, in terms of both energy and the environment, associated with traditional banking systems, including ATMs, security and servers.
“There are 3.6 million ATMs deployed in the U.S. Each of them are using 7 to 800 watts just in standby mode,” said Petrov. “This alone generates huge numbers of electricity usage, slightly higher than the Bitcoin network.
“If you add … internal banking systems, CTVs, communicating with other banks, additional protection … you get higher costs than the cost of Bitcoin,” he added.
“Gold mining consumes enormous energy. Portions of the electricity crypto mining consumes come from power generation and distribution originally built to supply ore and precious metals extraction or processing,” said Howard.
“Where traditional energy consumers like gold mines really fall down is all the other negative externalities of the ‘wealth’ they create. Gold mining during and after is one of the most toxic and destructive operations on the planet.”
Howard talked about the use of abandoned industrial sites for Bitcoin mining, like pulp and paper mills that had been closed due to dwindling forestry supplies and increased concerns about energy use and toxic waste pollution.
“Lots of crypto mines are sitting in old industrial sites with a 100-megawatt transformer sitting next to them,” he said.
By way of example, in the Q&A session that followed the panel, one conference participant talked about his mining operation in British Columbia in a partly abandoned manufacturing site where water is pumped through his mine for cooling and then recycled into a warm-water fish farm.
After the panel, Howard reiterated toBitcoin Magazinewhat other conference panelists had said: that large energy mega-projects like hydro dams produce electricity whether they’re used or not.
“To my knowledge, no one has built out any net-new power generation to supply a crypto mine. Power generation stations are major pieces of infrastructure that take years to put in place and in the range of a decade to pay off. Most power generation is done, certainly in the western world, by publicly owned and/or regulated utilities. Those stations run 24/7, 365 for decades. The energy goes onto the grid no matter what and, until we figure out storage, is a perishable commodity.
“Crypto mining takes full advantage of this, typically sucking up energy at very low prices. The prices are low because the energy can’t find more productive use, often taking over abandoned industrial sites far away from urban centers,” he added.
Čapek told the conference that “China has been overinvesting in hydro power and has large amounts of power that is not being used” as a result of overbuilding hydro dams in anticipation of industrial needs (principally aluminum manufacturing) that never materialized.
“Cheap hydro power has helped China dominate the world’s Bitcoin mining business, and this power would be generated with or without Bitcoin mining,” said Čapek, who recommended a recently releasedstudyon the energy costs of mining in China.
Čapek said a rough estimate of global Bitcoin mining energy use is 25 terawatt hours per year, only a fraction of the amount of energy used in manufacturing aluminum globally.
The panelists mostly agreed that proof of work’s higher energy use is necessary for real security and that proof of stake is not likely to happen soon. They noted that PoS would not give the Bitcoin network the security it needs, even if it was more energy efficient.
“The more energy that’s expended, the more security you have,” noted Mow. “The system has to be nuclear-proof.”
Petrov defended the possibility of a hybrid model of both PoW and PoS, saying, “Proof of stake may work for some specific purposes, not necessarily in the financial area but inside private blockchains.”
Mow responded that using both PoS and PoW “brings out the worst of both worlds,” while Howard noted that Dash is using a hybrid model with some success, though it’s very expensive to use.
Howard concluded: “It [Bitcoin mining] is a positive economic activity, typically in places where it is needed, as well as meaningful revenue to the utilities which are major employers and usually profit centers for governments. The ‘waste of energy’ argument, like most establishment arguments against blockchains, does not pass the test of science.”

39573,2020-12-04 17:58:33,Money Reimagined: Bitcoin vs. Gold Is a Battle of Narratives,"One reason I feel privileged to write about digital money is the ideas and technologies it seeks to disrupt aren’t just a few years or decades old. They date back centuries, even millennia.
Like gold, for example.
Asbitcoin’sprice has soared to new all-time highs and a parade of big-name investment professionals such asBlackRock CEO Larry Finkand hedge fund legendStanley Druckenmillerhave talked up its prospects as a provably scarce store-of-value, a war of words has sprung up between gold bugs and bitcoin fans.
Related:The Fiat Standard and Debt Slavery
Peter Schiff, one of the loudest proponents of gold as both a store-of-value investment and as a global standard for backing currencies, has been especially triggered. This past week saw a flurry of tweets from Schiff,labeling bitcoin a speculativeinstrument that lacks gold’s physical safe haven properties andcomplaining about the lack of airtimegiven to gold advocates versus bitcoiners. (Check the replies for colorful responses from bitcoin fans.)
This fight reflects something much bigger than a Twitter troll spat. It stems from an audacious effort by the crypto community to rewrite an ancient narrative.
Ultimately, winning the narrative is what will matter in this competition. As we’vediscussed before, a currency can have a host of worthy properties, but if there’s nobeliefin it, if the story doesn’t resonate, it won’t be accepted as money among a community of users.
Gold’s proponents frequently mention the qualities that make it a sound store-of-value with which to hedge against fiat currency debasement. Let’s run through them:
Related:Blockchain Bites: Price Point! Bitcoin at $50K? $60K? $318K?
It’sdurable. Gold can’t be destroyed.
It’sfungible. In its pure state, bullion holds the same value regardless of which bar you have in your hand, enabling its acceptance as both a medium of exchange and store-of-value.
It’sdivisible. After smelting, gold can be broken down into coins and ingots of any size.
It’sportable.Within limits, you can transport gold from one place to another.
And most important, it’sscarce. Setting aside the future viability or otherwise ofasteroid mining, the slow and expensive pace at which the world’s known gold reserves can be extracted means that, unlike fiat paper currencies, its supply can’t be expanded at will.
Note, these properties are also ascribed to bitcoin – rightly, in my mind, and with a superiority to gold. (Bitcoin is certainly more portable and more easily divisible, and its scarcity is arguably more reliable.)
But while durability, fungibility, divisibility, portability and scarcity are necessary preconditions for sound, non-fiat money, they’re not enough on their own. There are other precious metals, such as silver and platinum, with similar qualities. And there are altcoins literally built from the same code as bitcoin. What ultimately distinguishes both gold and bitcoin from their competitors is the wide collective belief in their shared value.
For gold, this belief is not only widely held. It runs deep. Very deep.
Gold is the stuff of fairy tales such as the one about King Midas. It powered the conquest of the Americas, encapsulated in the search forEl Dorado. It became synonymous with wealth and power.
And with beauty – to the point where we talk of gold’s beauty as if it’s innate or intrinsic. But beauty is culturally constructed. While evidence suggests gold’s use in jewelry preceded its use as money, there’s a circular, reinforcing logic to the aesthetic idea. Centuries of associating gold with wealth and power elevated its beauty in our minds.
In other words, there’s a powerful feedback loop arising from the “all that glitters is gold” story. It reinforces its cultural power – an ephemeral, intangible concept that’s actually more important than those five aforementioned physical qualities in giving gold its longstanding status as a universal store-of-value.
So, as you can tell, those driving the bitcoin narrative face a daunting competitor, a phenomenon with millennia-old cultural heft.
Yet, this moment feels ripe for a new story. We’ve entered a digital age, where the physical world is increasingly shaped and managed by a separate computing world. That world needs a “digital gold,” not a physical gold.
And it turns out the way to create that digital gold is by combining the power of math – another ancient, all-powerful human invention that rules how we live – with the power of collective human activity. That combination is what makes the bitcoin story so compelling.
At its essence, the proof-of-work consensus model (which lets us trust the transactions recorded in bitcoin’s distributed blockchain ledger) hinges on the fact that it’s mathematically really, really hard to find a randomly chosen number within a data set comprising quadrillions of other numbers. There’s something quite universal – literally, of the universe – in that.
But bitcoin’s claim to provable scarcity, which is fundamental to the store-of-value narrative that institutional investor big shots are now globbing onto, depends on more than its math – which, after all, can be and has been replicated in altcoin forks of the code. It also stems from mass human engagement and investment (of time, money and energy).
Bitcoin’s predictably scarce money supply depends on it being prohibitively expensive for anyone to take control of the network and on there being a sufficiently large, committed, international pool of developers working on keeping its code secure.
That’s where the widening resonance of the narrative becomes self-fulfilling. As more and more people believe in bitcoin, more and more will invest in it, which makes it increasingly expensive to attack it. Meanwhile, wider belief means more and more developers care about protecting bitcoin’s value. Both factors make it increasingly secure, which in turn increasingly strengthens its scarcity claim.
To me, this is what makes the bitcoin story more appealing than that of gold. Rather than stories of kings and conquest, it’s about human engagement under the governance of universal mathematical principles.
This epic narrative battle has a long way to go. I look forward to chronicling its development.
Speaking of gold, this chart in astory by financial news outlet Finboldjumped out at me. From a survey of the 12 largest economies in the world, Finbold found the central banks of U.S., China, Russia and India had accumulated a whopping 208.34 tons of gold between March and early-December this year. Their combined tally dwarfs an aggregate liquidation of 12.78 tons by the eight other countries in that list. It’s not clear where Finbold got its data from and it should be noted that central bank gold reserve information is notoriously difficult to confirm. But with that caveat in mind, the numbers are worth exploring.
Why the big buildup in gold holdings by these four countries since the COVID-19 pandemic became a global crisis? The natural answer is that, like people, governments see gold as a hedge against economic and monetary stress, and the crisis has elevated the risk of that. But thinking about the four countries’ individually offers some other hypotheses.
The U.S. and Indian numbers are somewhat self-explanatory. For the U.S. Federal Reserve, its massive mid-pandemic monetary expansion necessarily required the buildup of a giant balance sheet of financial assets, of which gold was a part. And India, mostly for cultural reasons, has always been a giant gold buyer, so these numbers are perhaps just an extension of that.
The Chinese and Russian stories are potentially more interesting. Typically, these two countries buy dollars, held in U.S. government Treasury bonds, as their reserve asset. That they’re also accumulating gold could point to something of a loss of confidence in the dollar. More important, the question is what they might do with that gold in the future.
And that’s where an insight from Jennifer Zhu Scott, executive chairman of The Commons Project, makes this interesting. Speaking during arecent Money Reimagined podcast episode, she noted that although it’s clear that China has been growing its gold reserves significantly, no one knows for sure how much it holds. That, she speculates, could put China in a powerful position to give the digital yuan clout in the international marketplace.
“When the digital [renminbi]is launched, China doesn’t even need to say this is backed by gold. China might just make an announcement saying ‘Oh, by the way, our real gold reserve is actually 4,000 tons.’” (According to Finbold, China’s total holdings currently stand at 2,196 tons.) That would give the new digital currency a solid basis, which may encourage other countries to use it. At the same moment, it would allow China to avoid the volatility it would otherwise face when it ends capital controls, a step it must take if it is to achieve wider international usage of the yuan.
What about Russia? Well, like China, one of the reasons it is thought to be keen on creating a digital currency is to have a mechanism by which it can reduce its dependence on the dollar – in its case, to achieve the explicitly expressed goal ofavoiding U.S. sanctions. A hefty gold reserve might also help it do that.
The bigger question, as per the column above, is whether these countries will eventually be better off accumulating bitcoin, rather than gold, as the backstop to their currencies.
THUMBS DOWN.Acolumn by Sarah Frierin Bloomberg’s daily “Fully Charged” newsletter this week highlighted the excessive power Facebook wields over advertisers and the audiences they seek. Small businesses that have  become dependent on Facebook ads for lead generation are now frustrated to find themselves in “Facebook jail” – locked out of the platform by an algorithm that’s supposed to police inappropriate content across its 3 billion users. The problem, Frier writes, is that “tiny glitches or misfires of this system can take down innocent users, who then have to hope a real human sees the mistake and resolves it. That’s a process that can take days, if it happens at all.”
The article is another example of the growing recognition that big centralized Internet platforms such as Google and Facebook have de facto monopoly powers that can harm the economy, a mindset that is feeding into the increased risk of antitrust action against them. As Frier writes, “For a company that’s fervently trying to convince lawmakers it’s not a monopoly, some advice: It’s usually a bad thing when an entire sector of the economy is dependent on your service in order to survive.”
What’s still missing from the mainstream conversation about these problems is a discussion of how more decentralized models of media control might better address them. Whether it’s a blockchain solution or something else, we need to recognize that the centralized architecture of internet platforms is the root of their gatekeeping powers. Whatever the solution, that context is vital for how society thinks about a redesign of the social media and digital content industry.
STABLECARD.The expansion of stablecoin payments was given another boost this week when Forbes’ Michael Del Castilloran a storysaying card network Visa would give its 60 million merchants worldwide access toUSDC, the stablecoin token developed by Circle Internet Financial and CoinBase. What’s interesting about that is USDC, as a bearer token, can move across borders from one party to another without the need for an intermediary. What it didn’t have was the network of users Visa offers. This looks like a solution for moving money internationally without using correspondent banks and the SWIFT messaging system. Another step toward disintermediated global finance.
BTC YIELD.Dan Held, who heads up growth at crypto exchange Kraken, has done a favor for everyone interested in turning their otherwise static bitcoin into an interest-earning asset. There are a host of ways to earn yield on your bitcoin these days and Held, who has been experimenting with them over much of the past year, created a summary of experiences and results in auseful tweet thread.
What I find interesting is that Held’s thread gives you a sense of the DIY nature of an emerging, decentralized financial system. In this system, bitcoin becomes a universal reserve asset, a form of collateral against which loans and speculative positions form.
Note: Interest payments in bitcoin markets are mostly derived by speculators, who borrow bitcoin from entities such as BlockFi to place short-selling bets. One way they do so, as Held points out, is to play the arbitrage between spot market prices and those quoted on derivative assets such as the CME bitcoin futures of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent company of CoinDesk.) That’s quite different from, say, earning interest on your dollar deposits at a bank, but it does look like how a lot of funding happens in the interbank market. Banks obtain short-term funds by lending out Treasury securities and other collateral, which are then used in short-selling operations.
For now, at least, it’s people, not institutions, who are providing the collateral and liquidity need for the back office aspects of a capital market system.
Why Ethereum and Bitcoin Are Very Different Investments. News you can use. The soaring price of bitcoin has in recent weeks coincided with concurrent gains inetherand other tokens. This gave the impression that retail investors are simply buying the latter as a substitutable alternative to the former. Here, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen explains why that assumption is wrong.
Bitcoin’s Price Is a Poor Proxy for Its Utility.As bitcoin investors celebrate its new all-time highs, CoinDesk columnist Jill Carlson is here to tell you to chill out and focus on what matters. Crypto, she reminds us, is supposed to be about expanding access to money, payments and finance, not earning legacy currency-denominated gains.
US Lawmakers Introduce Bill That Would Require Stablecoin Issuers to Obtain Bank Charters.This bill, introduced by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and others, may be a well-intended effort to protect consumers. But the overwhelming backlash from crypto experts, including many sympathetic to Tlaib’s interest in curtailing abuses of the little guy and boosting financial access, shows how badly it was thought out. Imposing high compliance costs on innovative startups trying to boost financial access will ultimately benefit  banking behemoths that have failed to service the poor adequately. We need better-informed legislators. Nikhilesh De’s write-through looks at some of the fallout.

In anannouncementon May 27, the Ren Project stated that it has now allowed native bridge support which allows the creation of wrapped assets directly on Polygon.
As with most migrations to the Layer 2 aggregator in recent weeks, it has been done to avoid excessive fees on the Ethereum network.
“This is a direct bridge so users do not need to go through Ethereum, allowing direct deposits/withdrawals to and from Polygon with minimal gas fees.”
It added that there were seven wrapped assets supported on Polygon: renBTC, renBCH, renDGB, renDOGE, renFIL, renLUNA, and renZEC. Users can also bridge assets through RenBridge with BTC, ZEC, BCH, and DOGE being supported initially.
In essence, RenVM, launched in May 2020, is a network of virtual computers that powers interoperability for decentralized applications, enabling cross-chain lending, exchanging, and collateralization of digital assets.
The network goal is to enable the permissionless exchange of value between blockchains and bring interoperability to the DeFi space. Tokens can be minted and wrapped using its RenBridge platform.
The announcement added that both teams will be pursuing the addition of Ren-based assets on all decentralized applications (dApps) that exist within the ecosystem, starting with Curve Finance, partners at tokenized Bitcoin yield platformBadgerDAO, QuickSwap, and Varen Finance.
Third-party developers can now build cross-chain dApps on Polygon with the RenJS SDK, it added.
Polygon has made a lot of progress recently in the wake of escalating Ethereum transaction costs. The protocol got a massive boost yesterday following the news thatbillionaire investor Mark Cuban had backed it.
RenVM’s native token, REN, has increased by 8% in value since its daily open. The token was trading at $0.63 at the time of press.
REN has taken a beating with the rest of them, however, dropping 30% over the past fortnight, and is still down 68% from its all-time high of $1.92 on Feb. 20.
MATIC started the day with a 17% loss, however, it’s back to trading just under its daily opening price at $2.18. The token is up 90% over the past two weeks but has not been able to top its May 18 all-time high of $2.62.",39153.53,-0.09,39150.01,-0.1,39488.18,0.76,39385.62,0.5,39190.0

""Right now, our daily trading volume is about 15 to 20 billion on a daily basis,"" Chen said. ""What do we see for 2025? Probably similar. Just like similar, I think a similar user profile and user growth and trading volume. Why? Because right now is already a bull market. 2025 is going to be a bull, but end of 25, we dunno.

15042,2018-01-24 23:44:00,50 Cent realizes he's a Bitcoin millionaire thanks to sales of a 2014 album,"Call him the ultimate hodler. After being one of the first musicians to accept Bitcoinall the way back in 2014, Rapper 50 Cent (a.k.a. Curtis Jackson) appears to have accumulated a small fortune in the volatile digital currency.
AsTMZfirst reported, and the man himself seems to have confirmed, 50 Cent left his Bitcoin sales untouched until rediscovering them some time recently. At the time, he reportedly raked in around 700 bitcoins in album sales for his fifth album, Animal Ambition, which launched in June 2014. TechCrunch reached out to confirm the numbers and will update when we hear back.
On the date of the album's launch, one bitcoin was worth $657. If reports of his 700 bitcoin haul are accurate, then 50 made around $460,000 in sales at the time — not bad.
Today, that same amount of bitcoin is worth $7,770,000.
50 appeared to confirm the news in an Instagram caption: ""Not Bad for a kid from South Side, I’m so proud of me,"" followed by the comment ""I'm a keep it real I forgot I did that shit. Lol."" A later Instagram post showed bitcoin imagery with the caption ""all moneys is good money over here.""
In 2015, 50 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and restructured his finances, agreeing to pay off $23 million in debt with a five-year plan. Last year, he reportedly finished paying off the $23 million early after receiving some money in a settlement. Back in 2011, the rapper debuted a set of headphonesmarketed with his personal brandand became theCEO of his own audio company, SMS Audio.
50 may have stumbled onto his crypto-millions, but that doesn't diminish his early vision to support the then still fairly obscure digital currency. Still, cryptocurrency fortunes can change at a moment's notice. We'd be curious to know if he plans to cash out or live that #hodler life.

ETH/BTC has been moving downwards since June 8, when it reached a high of ₿0.077. So far, it has reached a local low of ₿0.057 on June 23.
Technical indicators are bearish, supporting a continued downward movement. The MACD is negative and decreasing, the RSI is below 50 and decreasing, and the Stochastic oscillator has made a bearish cross.
It’s possible that the current downward movement is part of a sub-wave C (black) of afourth wavepullback. If so, ETH could reach a low of ₿0.05 before moving upwards. The target is the 0.618 Fib retracement level and would give sub-waves A:C a 1:1 ratio.
XRP/BTC has been decreasing since May 19 when it reached a high of 3,909 satoshis. So far, it has reached a low of 1,641 satoshis on June 23.
XRP has rebounded since and is in the process of reclaiming the 1,850 satoshi horizontal support area. Doing so would be a major bullish development.
If not, XRP would likely decrease all the way to 1,400 satoshis. This is the 0.786 Fib retracement support level and would validate a previous long-term descending resistance line.
Technical indicators are still bearish. The MACD is negative, the RSI has fallen below 30, and the Stochastic oscillator has made a bearish cross and is moving downwards.
XVG has been falling since reaching a high of $0.088 on May 8. On May 13, it reached a low of $0.016 and bounced. The bounce served to validate the $0.021 area as support. This level is the 0.786 Fib retracement support level.
On June 23, XVG returned to the area once more, creating a double bottom pattern. The pattern was also combined with bullish divergences in the MACD, RSI, and Stochastic oscillator. Therefore, an upward movement would be likely.
If so, the next closest resistance levels would be at $0.043 and $0.052. These targets are the 0.382 and 0.5 Fib retracement resistance levels (white).
On May 19, YFII reached a low of $1,169 and bounced. However, the upward movement could not be sustained and the price fell back to the $1,400 horizontal support level on June 23.
This created a double bottom pattern relative to the price on May 19.
The pattern has also been combined with bullish divergences in the MACD, RSI, and Stochastic oscillator.
If an upward movement occurs, the closest resistance would be between $2,438 and $2,736 — the 0.5-0.618 Fib retracement resistance area.
ANKR has been decreasing inside a descending parallel channel since March 28. So far, it has validated the support line of the channel five times (green icons), most recently on June 22.
This initiated a significant upward movement, creating a bullish candlestick the next day.
Currently, ANKR is in the process of reclaiming the $0.075 area and validating it as support.
Technical indicators are providing some bullish signs but not enough to confirm the bullish reversal. A bullish cross in the Stochastic oscillator would go a long way in confirming a bullish trend.
TRX has been moving downwards since April 17 after reaching a high of $0.18. It created a lower high on May 7 and accelerated its rate of decrease after.
TRX fell to a low of $0.046 on June 22. It has bounced since and is currently in the process of reclaiming the $0.063 resistance area.
However, despite showing some bullish signs, technical indicators have yet to confirm the possibility of a bullish reversal.

87291,2023-04-27 07:52:23,Bitcoin Market Impact From Mt. Gox Repayments Will Be Limited: Matrixport,"Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today
Bitcoin (BTC) slid 8%during the U.S. afternoon Wednesday on rumors that wallets tied to defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox and the U.S. government are making transactions, crypto-services provider Matrixport said in a report Thursday.
Matrixport says it has analyzed the potential market impact of the Mt. Gox haul and concluded that such an event would have limited effect on the bitcoin price. Still, investors should be well aware of the eventual distribution of those bitcoins, it said.
TheMt. Gox hackresulted in the theft of 850,000 bitcoins, valued at $500 million at the time and now worth $17.8 billion, the report said, noting that only 200,000 have been recovered.
“Since not all of the stolen BTC could be recovered, only a fraction of the original amount held by creditors will be compensated,” wrote Markus Thielen, head of research.
Creditors will receive a base payment with four options to receive the remainder of their funds, the note said.
These include “early lump-sum repayment (where customers can recover 15%-20% of their lost funds), repayment by bank remittance, repayment for a portion of crypto rehabilitation claims in crypto, or repayment through a fund transfer service provider,” the note added.
Sept. 30 is the deadline for repayments, the report said, with $1.7 billion in cash, 141,000 bitcoin and another 142,000 bitcoin cash (BCH) to be distributed as part of a civil rehabilitation plan.
Bitcoin was trading at around $28,920 at publication time.

Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC)has been the biggest cause of the moves in the market today. The impact on miners is clear because Bitcoin is the direct output of the mining they do, so if Bitcoin climbs, their revenue will go up. But they also benefit from the Bitcoin being held on their balance sheets.
Mara had 18,488 Bitcoin on its balance sheet at the end of the second quarter of 2024 and bought another $100 million more to exceed 20,000 Bitcoin in early August. Riot Platforms said it held 10,928 Bitcoin on its balance sheet as of October 2024.
Neither company could come close to MicroStrategy, which bought another 27,200 Bitcoin this month and now holds 279,420 Bitcoin. The company is the largest leveraged play on the cryptocurrency, even using its stock and debt to buy more of the crypto near all-time highs.
While the increase in Bitcoin's value is often seen as a positive for Coinbase, the real driver of the business is trading volume -- and that's gone through the roof. After hovering between $1 billion and $2 billion per day earlier this year, volume is now $7.8 billion in the last 24 hours, as of this writing.
This will likely drive a sharp increase in Coinbase's revenue in the fourth quarter, and profitability and cash flow should improve as well.
The fog of speculation is heavy today, and investors seem to be buying anything crypto-related on the hope a new presidential administration will make more favorable policy decisions. But most tokens themselves haven't been restricted in the U.S. -- it's what companies can do on the blockchain to sell assets or build businesses that have been in a gray area.
So, if there are changes to the regulatory environment, I'm not sure tokens like Bitcoin will be the beneficiaries like they are today. I think it's much more likely that blockchain infrastructure and stablecoins will do well, which is why Coinbase is the one stock I'm bullish on here.
There's a lot of innovation to be unlocked on the blockchain, and Coinbase has the stablecoin (USDC), blockchain (Base), trading platform, and other services for developers and business owners to make real businesses here. That's where I think there will be true innovation over the next decade, not in tokens moving up and down. But today, that's all the market is thinking about.

42381,2022-06-07 15:26:21,PayPal Ups Crypto Push: Users Can Now Move Coins to Other Wallets and Exchanges,"Don't miss CoinDesk'sConsensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12.
PayPal is finally allowing cryptocurrency holders to transfer their digital assets off its platform to other wallets and exchanges, the feature most often requested since the fintech giant’s crypto buy, sell and hold service went live in October 2020.
The move away from regimented custodial platforms towards more open systems is a trend being followed by other large fintech players to enter crypto, such as popular trading app Robinhood, which is rolling out anew crypto walletfocused on decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
It was backat CoinDesk’s virtual Consensus event in 2021that Jose Fernandez da Ponte, senior vice president, blockchain, crypto and digital currencies at PayPal, said plans to let users move their coins to third-party wallets were in the works.
“We are definitely responding to demand from users, that is one aspect,” said da Ponte in an interview this week. “We’ve also been very vocal from the beginning that we’re in this because we are a payments and commerce company, and we think that our role in the ecosystem is about increasing access.”
The ability to move bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC) from PayPal’s crypto platform to external wallets is available from Tuesday to select U.S. users (not in Hawaii) and rolling out to all eligible U.S. customers in the coming weeks, according to a blog post.
When PayPal first announced its move into digital assets, it seemed to kick-start a bull run in the crypto markets. By allowing its customers to send and receive crypto, PayPal has become the world’s largest blockchain-enabled consumer digital wallet, according to Walter Hessert, head of strategy at Paxos, an infrastructure provider to PayPal.
In a statement, he said the platform was “a monumental step in the mainstream adoption of digital assets and Web3.”
Asked about predictions for increased use of the platform in light of the new transfer functionality, “the early signs in terms of demand are very promising,” da Ponte said.
“I don’t know if it’s going to be about the absolute number of users, or it’s going to be more about folks continuing to move in the adoption cycle,” he said, adding: “We have a ton of people now who have adopted the basic product, and as they grow, they want to do more things. So, it’s less about bringing sophisticated users from the outside, it’s more continuing the learning curve for our base.”
Despite an ostensibly conservative approach to crypto, there’s much more going on behind the scenes at PayPal, whichacquired tech-heavy cryptocurrency custody firm Curvback in March of last year, and early this year was revealed to have been exploring a U.S. dollar-backed “PayPal Coin.”
“We want people on our platform acquiring digital currencies to be able to then use them to do something, whether it’s buying NFTs or interacting with games or other things, andstablecoinsare a component of that and really important for the commerce and payments aspect to grow,” da Ponte said.",29865.05,-0.13,29843.3,-0.21,29901.18,-0.01,29837.49,-0.23,29905.19
71519,2022-03-22 20:27:27,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin in Recovery Mode, Crypto Stocks Outperform","Bitcoin (BTC) reached a session high of $43,300, itshighest level in almost three weeks, as bullish sentiment improved among crypto traders.
Some alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) also edged higher on Tuesday, even as alts' recent gains against bitcoin were starting to fade. For example, ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after bitcoin, rose above $3,000 for thefirst time in two weeksand was up 3% over the past 24 hours, compared to a rise of as much as 4% in BTC over the same period. Meanwhile, Terra'sLUNAtoken was down 3% over the past 24 hours.
But some analysts remain cautious despite the recent price rise. ""This is not the first such jump in BTC since the beginning of March, in contrast to the neutral or even negative sentiment in the stock markets,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in anarticle. ""Until now, such impulses cannot be on a solid basis, because the fundamental demand for risks is under obvious pressure.""
Elsewhere, global equities traded higher on Monday while gold, a traditional safe haven, declined. The 10-year Treasury bond yield continued higher, tracking gains in oil prices as investors position themselves for high inflation and rising interest rates.

Is""altcoin season""making a comeback? Not quite.
For now, some analysts see the potential for a short-term relief rally in altcoins, which could signal a greater appetite for risk among crypto investors. Altcoins tend to outperform in bull markets because of their higher risk profile relative to bitcoin.
The chart below shows the cycle in bitcoin and altcoins over the past year. When Glassnode's risk indicators reach extreme highs, a greater allocation to bitcoin is warranted, similar to what occurred earlier this year. In contrast, when risk is low for an extended period of time, traders tend to shift toward altcoins as sentiment improves.
Currently, the risk signal (see last panel below) is still above 25, which does not suggest an aggressive rotation to altcoins. Read morehere.
And here is theAltcoin Season Indexby Blockchain Center. So far, roughly 25% of the top 50 coins are performing better than bitcoin over the past 90 days, which is below the 75% threshold to signal a bullish phase for altcoins (possibly too late for traders looking for a new trend).
Instead, based on previous cycles, altcoins tend to sustain their outperformance once the indicator crosses above the 50% neutral mark.
Another indicator of investor appetite for risk is the performance of crypto-related stocks relative to BTC.
The chart below shows the recent outperformance of the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators exchange-traded fund (BITQ), which tracks the performance of companies that generate the majority of their revenue from their crypto business activities. BITQ is now ahead of BTC over the past 30 days, which typically signals a bullish turn in crypto markets.

1470,2018-09-21 12:15:00,3 Lessons for Marijuana Stock Investors From the Bitcoin Bust,"Marijuana legalization has created a brand new industry, and investors are trying to profit from themarijuana stocksthat are best positioned to take advantage of new business opportunities. Between the dozens of U.S. states that allow marijuana sales for at least some purposes and the opening of therecreational marijuana market in Canadascheduled for mid-October, the investing world seems to believe that now is the time to pile into marijuana-related investments.
However, this isn't the first time that stocks in a particularly hot niche have soared. It was less than a year ago thatbitcoin stockswere all the rage, with those companies specializing in the cryptocurrency space seeing explosive gains. Many people never bother to look back at overhyped areas once they fall out of fashion, but investors who put their hard-earned money into popular stocks often learn the hard way what can happen.

If you're tempted to invest in marijuana stocks, here are a few things you should know going in.
Right now, a limited number of marijuana stocks is available to most investors. Many of the publicly traded marijuana production stocks, includingTilray(NASDAQ: TLRY),Cronos Group(NASDAQ: CRON), andCanopy Growth(NYSE: CGC), are headquartered in Canada and only became U.S. listed this year.Aurora Cannabis(NASDAQOTH: ACBFF)is just one of dozens of stocks that still don't have listings on major U.S. exchanges, making them available only on less liquid venues like the pink sheets and over-the-counter markets.
We've seen some massive moves in marijuana stocks likeTilray in recent days. Those gains stem from the fact that investors who want to invest in marijuana have limited options available to them.
That was definitely the case with many bitcoin stocks. In 2017, the top-performing bitcoin stocks were typically among the least liquid. That reversed itself in 2018, when thosehigh flyers came crashing back to earthmore abruptly than counterparts with greater trading liquidity. At least in Tilray's case, being listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market offers reasonable levels of liquidity, but if you choose shares of an unlisted stock instead, price swings could be even more severe -- in both directions.
Many companies are ready to pounce on any opportunity to participate in a highly hyped industry, even if it means an unrealistic apparent change in their business model. This phenomenon ran rampant with bitcoin in late 2017 and early 2018, with strategic shifts like biotech equipment maker Bioptixsuddenly changing its nametoRiot Blockchain(NASDAQ: RIOT)and announcing plans to shift its strategy toward cryptocurrency and blockchain. Riot has been one of the worst performers lately, losing 85% of its value in 2018 even as bitcoin's own declines have amounted to only about 50%.Long Blockchain, which waspreviously Long Island Iced Tea, has fared even worse, watching its share price plunge to penny-stock levels after a 95% drop in 2018.
The marijuana industry has seen the same phenomenon for years, with companies changing their names to adopt a more pot-friendly appearance. But when you look at these companies' financials -- if you can even find them -- you'll often see a lack of historical experience with cannabis and no reasonable expectation that its business model can compete against well-established players. That doesn't mean that all marijuana stocks are shady, but you do have to be on the lookout for companies that are more interested in trying to capitalize on a fad than in actually furthering the interests of their new industry.
Perhaps the most important lesson marijuana investors can learn from the bitcoin boom and bust is that success can come in unexpected places. As an investor, you have to be ready to look for secondary effects and how they can benefit companies that might not always seem related.
During the gold rush, a few stampeders won big, and most suffered huge losses. But one recipe for success was providing equipment like picks and gold pans for those seeking their fortunes. With bitcoin, that concept has helped propelNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA)andAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD)higher, because their graphics processor chips are integral in successful cryptocurrency mining operations. Even as bitcoin prices have fallen, NVIDIA and AMD have continue to rise, in large part because they have much larger operations beyond cryptocurrency to support them.
The same could well be true for marijuana. Already, companies likeConstellation Brands(NYSE: STZ)andCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO)are looking at ways tocollaborate with partnersin the marijuana production business. Players in the pharmaceutical industry as well as tobacco companies also see potential from working more closely with producers. In the long run, marijuana's surge could be a catalyst to deliver new growth to these well-established companies, making them safer plays than the production stocks.
Investors want to get rich frommarijuana stocks, but past investing crazes have often left people wishing they hadn't fallen for the allure of get-rich-quick schemes. By taking past lessons to heart, you can avoid repeating those mistakes and improve your chances of being successful with your investments in the long run.

16800,2018-02-02 17:27:00,Shares of Brooks Automation Decline Despite Topping Estimates,"Shares ofBrooks Automation(NASDAQ: BRKS), a worldwide provider of automation and cryogenic solutions for multiple markets including semiconductor manufacturing andlife sciences, are down 10% as of 11:00 a.m. EST after the company released first-quarter results.
Despite the stock price drop, the first quarter wasn't anything to shame. Revenue during the first quarter jumped 18.4% to $189.33 million, up from the prior year's $159.96 million. Its bottom line also moved higher from the year-ago $17.30 million, or $0.25 per share, to $22.50 million, or $0.32 per share -- that result was also higher than the $0.31 per share that analysts called for.

As CEO Steve Schwartz said in a press release:
Our Semiconductor Solutions Group delivered at the high end of our expectations in both revenue and gross margin, producing 19% margin at the segment operating income line. And the Life Sciences segment provided another quarter of exceptional year-over-year revenue growth of 42%, including 22% organic growth plus the benefits of our recent strategic acquisitions. Even amid the strong semiconductor business results, Life Sciences has now grown to be 25% of total revenue.
Looking ahead, Brooks Automation estimates second-quarter revenue to check in between $195 million to $205 million and earnings per share between $0.33 and $0.41, which are solid figures. The reaction from investors seems a bit harsh, and even over the course of writing this article, the original 10% loss in share price has softened to a 6% decline.

“In 2018, (the SSB) entered 16 administrative orders against promoters of suspect cryptocurrency investments who were using online advertisements, social media, and other solicitations to Collaborative Law Enforcement.”
The report also highlights the increasing partnership activities between the SSB and local law enforcement in tracking down and bringing perpetrators to justice.

Sainsbury’s is lifting its basic rate of pay to at least £10 an hour as part of a £100m investment aimed at retaining staff.
The 5.3pc rise, which comes into effect in March and also applies to Argos workers, takes the chain’s pay to above the National Real Living Wage.
Workers in central London will see their pay rise from £10.10 to £11.05, while for those in outer London it will increase from £9.75 to £10.50.
Sainsbury’s will also roll out further pay rises for drivers as the battle to attract and retain staff intensifies. It comes after Lidl said it would lift wages for around 21,000 staff members – or 80pc of its workforce.

A strong afternoon session helped the FTSE 100 climb into the green to end a broadly positive first week of trading in 2022, closing 0.5pc higher at 7,485.
Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: ""It's been a mixed finish to an otherwise positive week for European equity markets with the FTSE 100 outperforming today, due to outperformance from financials as well as basic resources.
""It came after the latest US payrolls report showed that wages pressure in the US economy is building, while the unemployment rate fell to pre-pandemic levels of 3.9pc.
""Higher yields are once again favouring the banks with Barclays, Standard Chartered, and Lloyds Banking Group outperforming, while the likes of Antofagasta, BHP and Rio Tinto are being buoyed by firmer aluminium and copper prices.""
Andreessen Horowitz raised $9bn (£6.6bn) to invest in a wide range of startups, completing one of the largest fundraising campaigns in venture capital.
The money is parked in three new funds, the firm said. More than half sits in a growth fund targeting more mature startups. The rest is distributed between a general venture fund and one specializing in biotech and health.
The fundraising effort exceeds one Sequoia Capital completed in 2020 that raised about $7bn. With the new cash, Andreessen Horowitz’s total assets under management is now more than $28bn.
At 12 years old, Andreessen Horowitz is young compared with the 50-year-old Sequoia, but it faces an army of new competitors. Many are capitalising on the rush to crypto, including one from a former Andreessen Horowitz partner, Katie Haun.
Lord Rothermere's deal to take the newspaper group Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) private has taken a step closer today.
The business tycoon disclosed his consortium now owns or has acceptances from other shareholders for 97.7pc of DMGT shares as part of his takeover.
Lord Rothermere now intends to pursue compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares, which will be on the same terms as his final takeover offer.
The company succeeded in its bid to take the publisher private last month with a 270p-a-share offer, or £871m, being accepted by shareholders.
The deal led to DMGT being delisted from the London Stock Exchange for the first time in nearly 90 years.
After years of lacklustre returns, things may be finally falling in place for the FTSE 100 in 2022, according to Goldman Sachs.
Higher rates will benefit value stocks over “longer-duration growth ones,” while a projected rise in prices for commodities such as oil and copper should also buoy household names in the British benchmark.
The UK's big cap index has been a consistent laggard since the Brexit referendum, with Goldman’s team attributing only a small part of that underperformance to the UK’s separation from the EU.
A more crucial factor has been the absence of high-flying technology champions from the gauge, which is instead dominated by banks and commodities behemoths.
A looming tightening of monetary policy across developed markets to tame surging inflation means that FTSE 100’s idiosyncratic composition will be an advantage this year. Still, over the medium term, a dearth of high-growth companies will tend to hold the index back, according to Goldman.

Citigroup is gearing up to confront vaccine holdouts after imposing a strict no jab, no job policy for its employees.
Staff who don't comply by January 14 will be placed on unpaid leave and have been told they will lose their job at the end of the month, according to an internal memo seen by Bloomberg.
While some of the employees will be eligible for certain year-end bonus payments, they'll have to sign an agreement that states they won't pursue legal action against the company to receive the funds.
The lender said: ""You are welcome to apply for other roles at Citi in the future as long as you are compliant with Citi's vaccination policy.""
According to the report, more than 90pc of employees have complied with the rule for US staff, which allows for employees to apply for religious or medical exemptions.
M&C Saatchi has confirmed it's received a takeover offer from tech entrepreneur Vin Murria, but said it did not reflect the value of the business.
The ad agency said it's received a non-binding offer from Ms Murria's shell investment vehicle AdvancedAdvT that would see it offer shareholders 1.86 Advt shares for each M&C Saatchi shares.
This values the company at around £222m, according to Bloomberg calculations.
In a statement the board said it did not think the offer represented an alternative strategy that would benefit shareholders beyond an initial change of control.
It added: ""Furthermore, the proposal does not reflect the value of the business and its future prospects and would disproportionately transfer equity value from M&C Saatchi shareholders to AdvT shareholders.""

Wall Street is fluctuating this afternoon after the latest jobs data fell well short of expectations.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were little changed at the opening bell, while the Dow Jones fell 0.1pc.
US private payrolls increased by only 199,000 in December, though the unemployment rate also fell to 3.9pc.
Marcus Bullus, director at MB Capital, argues the jobs figures could be a positive after hawkish minutes from the Federal Reserve earlier this week.
Following this line of thought there is a concern that the Fed may focus on the unemployment rate coming in lower than expected at 3.9pc to fuel more hawkish discussions at their next meeting, with fears of labour scarcity fuelling wage increases and inflation.
Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, says December's jobs report may heighten investor caution.
For the second month in a row, new job figures have underperformed expectations. However, falling unemployment and rising wages will be welcomed.
US private payrolls increased by only 199,000 in December, falling well short of expectations and signalling a slowdown in the jobs market.
The figure for nonfarm payrolls was down from 249,000 the previous month and well below estimates of 450,000.
The unemployment rate fell to 3.9pc in December, down from 4.2pc in November, while the participation rate was unchanged at 61.9pc.
The figures highlight the challenges faced by employers as they look to fill roles amid the pandemic.
Restrictions rolled out to tackle the rapid spread of the omicron variant ""wiped out"" much of the high street's fragile recovery in December, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC).
BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said much of the progress ""was wiped out in December as surging omicron cases and new work-from-home advice deterred many from shopping in-store, particularly in towns and city centres"".
The number of shoppers visiting UK stores slid 18.6pc in December compared with pre-Covid levels two years ago.
Ms Dickinson pointed out that footfall remained above the levels seen in many other European countries as Britain avoided more stringent lockdown measures.
But businesses and consumers are facing further threats in the new year amid surging inflation and a squeeze on household budgets.
Sir Richard Branson is set to list his first European blank cheque company in Amsterdam, marking a blow for the London Stock Exchange.
Sky News reports that the Virgin billionaire is drawing up plans to float a special purpose acquisition company (Spac) on the Euronext exchange in the coming months.
It's said the Spac will likely look to raise an initial sum of €200m (£167m), although the details are yet to be finalised.
His decision to go public in Amsterdam comes despite recent reforms to listing rules on the London market aimed at attracted more blank cheque deals.
US futures pushed higher this morning as traders looked to jobs data this afternoon amid speculation about the Federal Reserve's plans to tighten monetary policy.
Futures tracking the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were both up 0.3pc, while the Dow Jones gained 0.2pc.
US hiring may have more than doubled in December from the previous month to 447,000 new jobs, according to projections for the nonfarm payrolls report.
It comes after separate data that showed companies added the most positions in seven months.
However, with Fed officials preparing for aggressive rate hikes and a contraction of the central bank’s balance sheet, markets expect little chance of a change of heart even if today's figures come in below expectations.
Fuel retailers have hit back at accusations that forecourts were failing to pass on price savings to motorists amid an escalating row over the energy crisis.
While fuel prices have dipped from record highs in November, the RAC this accused retailers of failing to cut pump prices, leading to drivers paying an additional £160m last month.
But the Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) hit back at the claims, saying they had been hit by falling volumes and increased costs.
Gordon Balmer, chief executive of the PRA, told Bloomberg: ""For the whole of 2021 the margin on petrol was around 10p a litre. These are the sorts of numbers our members need in order to run a profitable business.""
The PRA said petrol and diesel prices had risen due to rising ethanol and bio-diesel costs, while retailers also faced higher costs for both energy and labour.
It added that forecourts' fuel purchases were priced on a weekly lagged basis, and reduced sales meant fuels they bought when prices were high were moving through petrol stations more slowly.
Shares in car dealership chain Lookers have pushed higher after it said trading had been ahead of expectations, despite the impact of chip shortages.
The London-listed firm forecast record pre-tax profit ahead of consensus of £82m. It said trading in the fourth quarter had beaten expectations, driven by higher margins, cost control and growth in aftersales revenue.
However, Lookers warned the global shortage of semiconductors continued to put pressure on the supply of new and used vehicles.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has cleared Admiral Taverns' £222m takeover of the Hawthorn pub business.
The regulator last year launched an inquiry into the deal, which will see Admiral take control of 687 pubs across the UK from retail property investor NewRiver.
In a statement today the CMA said it had accepted undertakings given by Admiral and so would not be referring the merger for an in-depth investigation.
Shipping group Clarkson has leapt to the top of the FTSE 250 after it said trading in December had been ""stronger than anticipated"".
The London-based firm hailed a strong end to the year and said pre-tax profit for the full year would be no less than £69m.
Shares rose as much as 4.7pc following the update.
Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd has been appointed to the board of British Gas' parent company.
Centrica said Ms Rudd will join as a non-executive director on 10 January and will sit on its safety, environment and sustainability committee, as well as the remuneration committee.
It's the latest appointment for the former Cabinet member, who also served as Energy Secretary and Work and Pensions Secretary before resigning from the party over her opposition to a no-deal Brexit.
In 2020 Ms Rudd was selected as chairman of Norwegian oil giant Equinor's international advisory group.
Scott Wheway, chairman of Centrica said:
As Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Amber was the driving force in the UK's participation in the Paris Climate Change Agreement, the first legally binding global commitment to reduce national carbon emissions.
French finance minister Bruno Le Maire has branded the surge in energy prices an ""absolute emergency"", adding that the Government was trying to find ways to protect consumers and businesses.
France has pledged to contain the annual increase in electricity prices at 4pc, primarily using tax cuts. But the surge in wholesale costs has taken policy makers by surprise and the finance ministry is negotiating with state-controlled EDF for other fixes.
“If we don’t find a solution in the coming days, French people will see an increase between 35pc and 40pc in electricity bills,” Le Maire said. “It is an absolute emergency because the explosion in electricity prices is neither sustainable for households nor for businesses.”
Rising energy prices have been a driving force behind inflation, which now stands at 3.4pc in France – its highest level since 2008.
Le Maire also pointed to the potential social consequences from the surge in living costs.
He said: “Look at what is happening in Kazakhstan; it’s quite instructive in terms of what can happen when energy, electricity or gas prices explode. It’s politically dangerous.”
The sharp rally in gas prices came to a halt this morning after the Netherlands said it may boost production at its biggest field this year.
Output from the Dutch Groningen field may total 7.6bn cubic metres in the 12 months to September, according to data from grid operator Gasunie.
This helped ease pressure on the market, which has seen prices jump by more than a third this week alone.
Benchmark European prices were little changed in Amsterdam, while the UK equivalent ticked up 0.2pc.
Ryanair will close its base at Frankfurt at the end of March in protest at increased charges at the airport.
The budget airline says it will withdraw from the German hub on March 31, adding it has reallocated the five aircraft it uses there to airports with lower fees.
Ryanair said all pilots and cabin crew based in Frankfurt received notification of the closure today.
The company said it had ""no alternative in response to a decision from the airport to increase its airport fees, despite the collapse in traffic caused by the Covid-19 pandemic"".
It added that the increased charges had made Frankfurt ""uncompetitive with European airports"".
Inflation in the eurozone rose above already record highs, defying expectations for a slowdown and piling pressure on the European Central Bank.
Consumer prices jumped 5pc in December from a year earlier after rising 4.9pc the previous month. A measure that strips out volatile elements such as food and energy held steady at 2.6pc.
Meanwhile, economic confidence in the eurozone fell by more than forecasts amid the rapid spread of the omicron variant across the continent.
The figures will put more pressure on the ECB to step in as supply troubles and soaring energy costs push up prices at the fastest rate since the common currency was introduced in 1999.
The central bank has refrained from tightening its monetary policy, insisting that the current spike in inflation is temporary.
Sterling has edged higher this morning, making it the only G10 currency to rally against the dollar this week despite economic data showing the impact of omicron on the services and construction sectors.
The pound rose 0.1pc to $1.3546. Against the euro, it was little changed at 83.51p.
Expectations of further interest rate rises by the Bank of England have driven up UK yields faster than other European nations, while traders will have an eye on a speech by MPC member Catherine Mann later today.
Jan Crosbyat KPMG said the construction sector will be upbeat despite ongoing pandemic threats.
The sector has shown great resilience through the events of the past two years, remaining robust despite having seemingly endless obstacles and pressures to contend with. And it will need to keep doing so as we enter 2022, with the impact of the ongoing omicron variant, supply chain issues and skills shortages continuing to create uncertainty in the months ahead.
The UK construction sector posted another month of solid growth in December, but the rate of expansion slowed to its lowest since September.
The IHS Markit Construction PMI came in at 54.3 last month, down from 55.5 in November and the weakest rate for three months.
Survey respondents said tighter pandemic restrictions and rising Covid cases had acted as a brake on the recovery – especially in the commercial sector.
On a more positive note, the number of construction firms reporting supplier delays dropped from 47pc in November to 34pc in December as bottlenecks eased.
Fewer supply shortages also contributed to the slowest rate of input price inflation for nine months.
Shares in beer and cider maker C&C Group fell as much as 3.6pc this morning after it warned the spread of omicron had hit sales in December.
The FTSE 250 firm, which owns brands including Magners, Bulmers and Tennent's, said performance was behind expectations as fresh restrictions in the UK and Ireland dampened trading in the key festive period.
The downbeat comments also dragged down rivals, with Fevertree dropping 5pc and Guinness owner Diageo falling 1.7pc.
German industrial production fell slightly in November as persistent supply bottlenecks took their toll.
The country's dominant manufacturing sector produced 0.2pc less than in the previous month, official figures showed, following a revised rise of 2.4pc in October.
Production levels in November were 2.4pc below the same month in 2020, and lagged Germany's pre-Covid output in February 2020 by 7pc.
While output lagged, exports from Europe's largest economy economy rose by 1.7pc in November on the previous month – marking the second consecutive month of increases.
The value of exports hit €126bn (£105bn), with exports to other EU countries rising by 14pc year on year.
After a sluggish start, the FTSE 100 has now slipped 0.2pc into the red, with investor focus firmly on US jobs data due later today.
Mining stocks includingRio Tinto,BHPandEvrazall pushed higher amid rising copper prices, helping to cap losses on the index.
The latest US jobs report is of added significance after minutes from the Federal Reserve's December meeting signalled faster-than-expected rate hikes, triggering a global sell-off in equity markets.
The domestically-focused FTSE 250 dropped 0.7pc, with drinks makerC&Cdropping 2.7pc after it said omicron hit sales in December.
Aston Martin has said its profits will be around £15m lower than expected in the fourth quarter due to ongoing issues with its £2.4m Valkyrie hypercar.
The company shipped only 10 of the luxury sports cars during the three-month period as it battles electronics issues with the vehicle, which has been seen as key to returning the firm to profitability.
Aston Martin will reached its goal of selling more than 6,000 cars last year thanks to strong demand for the DBX, its first SUV.
Chief executive Tobias Moers said: ""The Valkyrie programme is now running at rate for 2022 having focused on delivering with no compromises in the face of supply chain challenges and huge complexity in the production ramp-up which resulted in a timing impact for 2021.""
Aston Martin has undergone a major restructuring since it was rescued by Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll 18 months ago.
The FTSE 250 carmaker said is cash balance at the end of the year was £420m – higher than previously anticipated.
Bitcoin has slumped to its lowest level since September amid a wider sell-off in cryptocurrencies.
The digital coin dropped as much as 5pc to below $41,000 – its lowest since September 29. Bitcoin has lost more than 40pc of its value since hitting a record high of $69,000 in November.
The world's biggest cryptocurrency is notoriously volatile, but there's been further pressure on prices recently after the Federal Reserve hinted at a more aggressive approach to digital assets.
The global computing power of the Bitcoin network has also dropped sharply this week following the shutdown of Kazakhstan's internet amid uprisings in the country.
The fall will cast doubts over Goldman Sachs' bullish forecasts earlier this week, when it said Bitcoin could hit $100,000.
Apple boss Tim Cook's pay soared to almost $100m (£74m) in 2021 as he completed 10 years as the iPhone maker's chief executive.
His $98.7m pay packet marked a more than six-fold increased compared to the previous year, according to company filings. Mr Cook's base salary of $3m remained unchanged, with the majority of the increase coming from stock awards.
It came as Apple posted record profits last year, while sales also rose to a record $365bn. The company has continued to deliver bumper results for investors, too, with shares rising about 80pc last year.
Apple said: “It’s been a remarkable decade for Apple and in 2021 Mr Cook was granted an equity award for the first time since he was promoted to chief executive in August 2011.”
The FTSE 100 has faltered at the open following Wednesday's sell-off driven by hawkish Fed comments.
The blue-chip index inched only marginally higher to 7,450 points.
Shell has vowed to buy back $5.5bn (£4bn) worth of shares ""at pace"" using the proceeds of asset sales as it forecast ""significantly higher"" profits from gas trading in the fourth quarter.
The oil giant announced the buyback last year following the $9.5bn sale of its Permian oil and gas assets. The move was approved on New Year's Eve at the first board meeting since the company's relocation of its headquarters to the UK.
Shell's earnings from gas trading dropped in the third quarter due to production problems in several locations.
In an update this morning the FTSE 100 company said it had overcome the issues, with earnings set to come in much higher in the fourth quarter as it cashed in on high gas prices.
However, results from Shell's oil trading and refining unit were weaker than expected due to extended maintenance at one of its refineries and the impact of Hurricane Ida, with the division set to post a loss.
But before prospective homebuyers get too excited, there's a word of caution.
Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, says that while price growth will slow, an outright fall is unlikely.
The ingredients for any serious correction in property values are lacking. Bank of England data showed the average interest on a new mortgage falling to a record low of 1.5pc in November. So, any upward move in mortgage costs will take place from an extraordinarily low level.
Gareth Lewisat property lender MT Finance, says that while prices are still increasing, ""transactional flow has slowed a little, along with price growth"".
It will be interesting to see the housing market return to a level of normality over the next few months, without the government stimulation in the form of the stamp duty holiday which fuelled much of last year's activity.
Jan Crosbyat JPMG says the sector must focus on building sustainable and affordable housing.
The demand for housing continues to outstrip supply, which is underpinning house prices leading to another sharp rise this month. This is due to a combination of houses selling very quickly and the global supply chain issues with building supplies, which have existed for some time, now being exacerbated by lorry driver shortages.
Russell Galley, Managing Director, Halifax, said:
The lack of spending opportunities afforded to people while restrictions were in place helped boost household cash reserves. This factor, alongside the stamp duty holiday and the race for space as a result of homeworking, will have encouraged buyers to bring forward home purchases they’d maybe planned for this year.
Good morning.
It won't come as a surprise, but the latest housing from Halifax show another bumper month in December, with prices gaining 1.1pc to a new record high of £276,091.
It caps off a remarkable year for the market, which defied the sombre mood in the wider economy to post ever greater growth.
December's annual growth of 9.8pc marked the fastest pace since July 2003, while the cash gain of £24,500 across 2021 as a whole was the largest since March 2003.
Last year, the average house price reached a new record high a remarkable eight times.
But things are almost certain to change in 2002, with rising interest rates and inflation set to slam the brakes on the market's unfettered growth.

58201,2023-03-14 13:22:43,Bitcoin jumps to highest since June as rally gathers pace,"By Elizabeth Howcroft and Tom Wilson
LONDON (Reuters) -Bitcoin hit a nine-month high on Tuesday, taking gains past 30% in four days as it shrugged off chaos in global markets after last week's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and rode expectations that U.S. interest rates won't rise so fast.
Bitcoin jumped as much as 9.6% to $26,533, its highest since June 2022, in its fourth straight days of gains.
Major cryptocurrencies have been buoyed in recent days by U.S. authorities announcing plans to limit the fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).
U.S. authorities' action helped stabilise the major USDC stablecoin, whose issuer Circle had deposits of $3.3 billion at SVB. The steadying of USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin and a key cog in digital token trading, was seen as positive for the crypto sector as a whole.
Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has taken in its stride the collapses of SVB and Signature Bank over the weekend, and Silvergate Bank earlier this month, all key banking partners for a number of crypto firms.
Helping the asset on Tuesday, analysts said, was U.S. consumer price data that showed inflation still rising, but at a slower pace than the previous month. The widely anticipated reading may lead the Federal Reserve to slow or even pause hiking interest rates next week.
""CPI data being in line with expectations has been very supportive for interest rate sensitive crypto assets such as bitcoin,"" said James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares.
Other factors have also helped bitcoin, said Richard Usher, head of over-the-counter trading at London crypto firm BCB Group, citing a move by the Binance exchange to convert its $1 billion industry recovery fund to tokens including bitcoin.
""With CPI falling in line with expectations today and the recent fall in global yields signalling that interest rate hikes may be pared back, we have broken $25,000 with $28,000 the first target,"" said Usher.

83655,2023-09-29 21:49:36,What is fiat money?,"Portions of this article were drafted using an in-housenatural language generation platform. The article was reviewed, fact-checked and edited by oureditorial staff.
Fiat money is a form of government-issued currency that does not have intrinsic value and is not backed by a physical commodity such as gold. Fiat money has been around for centuries, but its use has become increasingly common in the modern world. In fact, most countries use fiat currency. The U.S. dollar is a fiat currency, and so are the euro, British pound and Japanese yen, to name a few.
Here’s what you need to know about fiat money, its advantages and disadvantages and alternative forms of currency.
The value of fiat money is determined by the amount of it that is available and the stability of the government that issued it. It’s not inherently valuable and is only considered money because the government has authorized it to be used as a medium of exchange. Consider the U.S. dollar bill. It’s a piece of paper. Its value is established through the nation’s economic stability and the government’s reliability.
Fiat money can fluctuate based on factors such as inflation, economic conditions and the confidence in the government that issues it. In many countries a central bank, like the Federal Reserve in the U.S., manages the money supply and the stability of fiat currency. Factors such asinterest ratesand market operations help control inflation and aid in maintaining the value of the currency. “Raising interest rates not only helps keep inflation low, but it can boost the value of the currency as investors worry less about the erosion of buying power and look to take advantage of the higher interest rates,” says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.
Here are some examples of fiat currencies around the world:
Issued by the Federal Reserve, the U.S. dollar has not been backed by gold or silver since 1971. The U.S dollar is widely accepted as a global currency and is one of the most traded currencies in the world.
The euro is the official currency of 20 European countries, which are collectively known as the Eurozone. Some countries that are not EU members use the euro as their de facto currency. The European Central Bank is responsible for managing the stability of the euro.
The yen is the official currency of Japan and is the third-most traded currency in the world after the U.S. dollar and euro. The yen is a major currency in the global foreign exchange market.
The British pound sterling, commonly referred to as the pound, is the official currency of the U.K. The pound is issued by the Bank of England, and is one of the oldest existing currencies.
Many countries rely on fiat currencies, and with good reason. There are some clear advantages to the system. Here are a few:
Economic control:Fiat currency empowers central banks to exercise control over the monetary supply when the currency is not backed or based on precious metals. This allows governments to manipulate interest rates, regulate credit supplies, implementinflationcontrol measures and more.
Cost-effective:Fiat money offers a cost advantage as it can be produced relatively cheaply, which can help reduce the supply costs of currency. Precious metals that have been historically used as currency, like gold, are costly to source and have limited availability.
Accepted worldwide:Fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar are used around the world making them ideal for international trade and business transactions.
Streamlined:Using paper money eliminates the hassle of transferring precious metals among banks. Fiat currency facilitates fractional reserve banking, which enables commercial banks to utilize more money to fulfill borrowing demands.
While fiat currency can be quite advantageous, it does have some drawbacks:
Inflation:One of the most well-known disadvantages of fiat money is the potential for inflation. Because fiat currency isn’t linked to any valuable commodity, it can be produced in unlimited quantities, especially if a government is facingbudget deficitsor high levels of debt. This can lead to a vicious cycle of debt and inflation, potentially leading to economic bubbles.
Dependence on government values:Fiat money gets its value from the trust and confidence placed in the issuing government. So, the value of the currency depends on the economic conditions of the issuing country and the stability of its government and institutions.
Subject to manipulation:Since there is no limit to the amount of fiat money in circulation, it is subject to constant manipulation by the central bank and the government. This can lead to inflation, interest rate manipulation and other issues.
The U.S. adopted the gold standard in the late 1800s. In 1913, in response to the panic of 1907, the Federal Reserve in the U.S. was established and acquired the authority to control the money supply, and the quantity of money produced. In 1933, during the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt suspended the gold standard. He issued an executive order that required all citizens to turn in gold in exchange for dollars in an attempt to inflate the money supply and help fight the economic downturn.
During World War II, the U.S. and Britain started to lay the groundwork for post-war economic stability. This led to theBretton Woods Agreement, which was negotiated by 44 countries in 1944. Among other things, it created the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The latter helped establish a system of fixed exchange rates centered on the U.S. dollar and gold.
Then, in 1971, President Richard Nixon announced his New Economic Policy, which, among other economic initiatives, suspended the convertibility of the dollar to gold — in other words, ending the gold standard. This marked a shift in the global monetary system.
While most people rely on fiat money in their daily lives, there are a few alternatives:
Commodity money possesses intrinsic value, meaning it has non-monetary value that can also be used for commercial or industrial purposes. Examples include gold and silver. Commodity money’s value stems from its limited supply, which can’t be easily manipulated by a central authority. The downside to commodity money is that it's generally not as widely acceptable and usable as many fiat currencies. For example, you likely won't be able to pay your rent or buy a coffee with a bar of gold.
Representative money is currency that isn’t valuable itself but is backed by something of value. It is usually issued in physical form, such as paper bills or coins, that represent some amount of gold. The actual commodity is often held in the vaults of a bank or other institution. Many currencies used to be representative money, such as the U.S. dollar.
One of the reasons for the emergence ofBitcoin, the most popularcryptocurrency, was the inflationary nature of fiat currencies and the desire for an alternative that is predictable and limited. Despite gaining popularity, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are not entirely considered ""money"" in the conventional sense and are subject to volatility andfraud, and are costly to produce.
While it’s generally normal for fiat money to decline in value over time due to inflation, there are some examples where the value has decreased rapidly, leading to economic challenges.
• Zimbabwe: Zimbabwe experienced a failed fiat money system in the early 2000s helped in part by land reforms gone wrong and government failures, including rampant money printing. The country has one of the world’s most inflated currencies, with inflation rates reaching astronomical numbers in the last twenty years. However, in May 2023, the country debuted a gold-backed digital currency in efforts to shore up Zimbabwean dollars to other major currencies.
• Venezuela: Venezuela has been grappling with hyperinflation for years due to a series of economic crises and government mismanagement. In 2018,Venezuela’s dictator Nicolás Maduro announced a planto fight inflation by replacing the current currency with a new one; effectively, the only difference being the amount of zeros on the banknote. That didn’t prove to help as in 2021, the inflation rate was686 percent, and in 2022 it was 234 percent.As of summer 2023, annual consumer prices hit 404 percent and the Venezuelan bolivar weakened to 30 units per dollar,according to Reuters.
Other examples of failed fiat money systems include the Weimar Republic in Germany, Hungary in the mid-1940s, Chile throughout the 1970s and 1980s and Belarus in the early 1990s and late 2000s.
While fiat money is the predominant type of officially accepted currency, it carries certain risks. Mishandling the money supply, such as excessive printing, can lead to hyperinflation. Political instability can erode trust in the country’s government and potentially diminish the currency’s value. In many cases, however, the risks of a currency not backed by a physical commodity are worth it, as fiat money allows governments the power to establish monetary policies, manage inflation and promote economic stability.",26888.0,-0.01,26882.07,-0.03,26877.01,-0.05,26884.89,-0.02,26890.72

But the gains this year have not been even. Some sectors,such as pharmaceuticalsand retail, continue to struggle. Meanwhile, tech names are among the hottest stocks, and cryptocurrencies are red-hot as well.
Knowing where to put capital to work in a market like this is important. This is especially true since the market recovery is likely to continue in fits and starts amid signs the economy is slowing. Corporate earnings are proving to be a mixed bag and more interest rate hikes are likely in the near term.
The names below are among the hottest stocks and cryptos on the market right now, having significantly outperformed the broader market so far this year.

Semiconductor stocksare making a big comeback this year. Within the sector,Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ:AMD) has been one of the best performers recently, rising 39% year to date and more than 57% over the past six months.
Investor sentiment toward AMD and other semiconductor and microchip manufacturers improved as global supply chain problems eased and as artificial intelligence (AI) has dominated headlineswith the advent of large language models such as ChatGPT. It is chips designed by AMD and others that are expected to power the development of AI technology. Additionally, AMD continues totake market sharefrom its chief rival,Intel(NASDAQ:INTC).
On Jan. 31, thecompany reportedbetter-than-expected Q4 revenue and earnings. This positive print stood in sharp contrast to the nightmarish results issued by Intel thatsent its shares spiraling. While AMD did warn of a 10% decline in year-over-year sales for this year’s first quarter, the company has a history of under-promising and over-delivering.

The entire cryptocurrency sector has been red-hot this year. However, no crypto is hotter right now thanEthereum(ETH-USD). Coming off its recentShanghai hard fork, or “Shapella” upgrade, ETHran up past $2,000. While the token has given back some of those gains, it is still up nearly 7% so far this month and more than 60% this year.
The Shanghai hard fork allows people to access the cryptocurrency more easily, and analysts have said it could potentiallyunlock more than $30 billion of liquidityin Ethereum. The upgrade provides more liquidity by allowing investors to withdraw their staked assets quickly and efficiently.
The latest upgrade followsthe “Merge,”which occurred in September and made Ethereum the most energy-efficient cryptocurrency to validate. Some ETH bulls claim that it isonly a matter of timebefore it surpassesBitcoin(BTC-USD) in price.

Almost everybody on the planet recognizes gold is because it was already there when they were born. For whatever reason, the whole world now accepts that gold is a thing to covet.

I would have loved to see the first gold transaction go down. One person trying to convince another that this yellowish inert rock is valuable. Now, most of us understand that it is rare, therefore it has high value.
Source: Charts by YahooFinance
When people want something and there’s not enough of it to go around, its value explodes. TheBitcoin(CCC:BTC-USD) and ETH concepts are exactly the same. It doesn’t matter how they work or what they do – if anything. All we need to know is that they exist and millions love them. Therefore, they are expensive, really expensive. ETH is now worth twice as much as gold.
Bitcoin is the best performing assetby far for over a decade. Nothing even comes close, yet some still call it fake. If they don’t believe in Bitcoin, they definitely won’t believe in ETH. Experts argued that Bitcoin needed to catch up to the market cap of gold. That was a big part of the bullish argument. While it is still far, it is closing in fast. I want to apply that logic to ETH catching up to BTC.
I made this argument in early Marchand that trade served us well. ETH rallied 200% from low to high. But this is not the end of the story because these are volatile assets. The opportunity then was clear as day to me and the logic has staying power. This is not a one-and-done scenario. Many wrote off BTC after its first crash from $19,000. It has since silenced most of the critics. The ones still squawking are being too rigid for their own good.
The 2020 pandemic and ensuing lockdowns were proof that we need crypto. The world has to evolve with how it stores and transacts wealth. In addition, these long-term loose monetary rules from central banks destroyed cash. Diverting some to crypto is a way of seeking shelter from QE infinity. The Fed actions are contributing to the grab for e-coins.
This fact could be the cause for the next crash in ETH. Yes, there will be many of them and they will be buying opportunities. Investing in crypto is an ongoing process. This is not the case of waiting for a perfect opportunity because it might never come.
This week we finally saw some inflation in the CPI reports. This may force the Fed to reconsider its QE levels sooner than 2023. If so, it may relieve some buying pressure off crypto.
In conclusion, I don’t really care what ETH does, or how I can use it as a coin. I want it as an investment vehicle, and I only need to know that it is riding the Bitcoin coattails. Just like it’s big brother, I expect extreme volatility along the way. Therefore, I should invest in small tranches and over time.
Trying to time it is difficult even for people like me who can read charts. Most retail investors lack the skills necessary to play that game.
Recently, prices soared to $4,400 then quickly faded in just a few hours. A 20% drop sounds like a major crash but this only took it back to levels of three days ago. ETH could fall to $2,800, which is an additional 25% drop and not change anything. Just last month it was under $2,000, so clearly this one moves fast and either direction.
The bulls are in charge and the critics are on the defense.

85588,2024-02-06 12:00:00,GRIID Infrastructure to Add 60 MW with New Bitcoin Mining Facility in Tennessee,"CINCINNATI, Feb. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --GRIID InfrastructureInc. (NASDAQ: GRDI) (“GRIID” or “Company”), an American infrastructure company that develops and operates vertically integrated bitcoin mining facilities, announced plans to develop and operate a 60 MW bitcoin mining site in Tennessee. The new mining site will be located in Jackson, Tennessee on a 15-acre plot owned by the Company.

""We are excited to have GRIID Infrastructure expand their operations in our hometown,"" said Mayor Conger. ""The company is the first of its kind in Jackson, further highlighting our reputation as a center of innovation and business expansion.""

As per data, 21Shares manages more than $2 billion in 28 cryptocurrency ETPs and has over 100 listings. The asset manager claims to have the world’s only ETPs tracking Binance, while having fourCryptoIndex Baskets, and two ETPs with investor staking rewards (TezosandSolana).
Exchange-traded products are expected to enable market players to get exposure to the crypto assets without the need to own the underlying assets. According to the official press release by 21Shares, Decentraland ETP, Aave, and 21Shares FTX Token ETP will soon be listed on Euronext Paris and Amsterdam.
The performance of the ETPs will be directly linked to the tokens without leverage, while 21Shares will hold the underlying assets in its cold storage. Just last week, 21Shares announced listing MANA and FTT on the Swiss-based BX exchange.
Commenting on the development, the CEO and co-founder of the firm, Hany Rashwan was quoted as saying that adding the world’s first NFT and single Metaverse ETP was one of the company’s key milestones.
That said, these ETPs aim to increase larger market exposure making cryptocurrency investments accessible and available for the crowds. For now, the recent listings of MANA, AAVE, and FTT are set to happen on Euronext exchanges in Paris and Amsterdam.
Decentraland (MANA) emerged as one of the most established tokens in the metaverse ecosystem, with a market cap of almost $6 billion. AAVE, on the other hand, is an Ethereum token that drives decentralized non-custodial money market protocol, Aave. FTT is the native token of FTX exchange.
Price-wise,BTC’srecent fall close to the $40K mark has pulled down thelarger market capto $1.87 trillion, affecting most of the top altcoins.
MANA, AAVE, and FTT too under the larger market effect couldn’t reap the benefit of the recent ETP announcement as their price noted losses of 3.20%, 7.34%, and 4.3% respectively, at press time.
With ETPs and ETFs taking over the market, a higher adoption in the mid-short term could be expected. Recently, asset manager Fidelity International alsoannounced the launchof its spot Bitcoin ETP in Europe, which was dubbed as the world’s cheapest BTC ETP.

Market Moving Headline:The selloff that’s tearing through high-valuation tech shares has battered Cathie Wood’s flagship ETF.
The ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund (ARKK) dropped for a seventh straight day Wednesday in its longest slide in nearly two and a half years. After surging roughly 150% in 2020 thanks to a string of prescient bets on Tesla Inc. and stay-at-home tech darlings, the negative stats are starting to add up.
ARKK, which edged lower in early trading on Thursday, is down more than 10% for the year and investors are piling into protection against more losses. Put volume hit 190,000 Tuesday, the most in six weeks and the fourth-most on record. The latest data show outflows for a sixth consecutive day, the longest streak since the fund launched in 2014.

2153,2018-10-23 00:03:48,NYSE Owner’s Bitcoin Futures Market Will Open in Mid-December,"Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), will list its highly-anticipated bitcoin futures contract in less than two months, on December 12.
Known as aphysically-settled daily futures contract, the contracts will be backed by actual bitcoins held in ICE’s Digital Asset Warehouse. According to a press release, each futures contract will be validated through ICE Clear U.S., the firm’s clearing venue.
The press release states in part:
“Each futures contract calls for delivery of one bitcoin held in the Bakkt Digital Asset Warehouse and will trade in U.S. dollars and others. One daily contract will be listed for trading each Exchange Business Day.”
Launched in apartnership betweenICE — the operator of 23 leading global stock exchange, including the NYSE — and other household names including Starbucks and Microsoft, the Bakkt venture aims to create an open, compliant ecosystem for digital assets.
Bakkt wascreatedto be a “regulated ecosystem” that provides protection for institutional investors who want to get exposure to cryptocurrency. At the time of the announcement inSeptember, Bakkt had said the physical bitcoin futures would be traded against the U.S. dollar, British pound sterling, and euro.
“A critical element to price discovery is physical delivery. Specifically, with our solution, the buying and selling of bitcoin is fully collateralized or pre-funded. As such, our new daily bitcoin contract will not be traded on margin, use leverage, or serve to create a paper claim on a real asset,” Bakkthadsaid at the time, responding to criticisms that the contracts could mask “hidden leverage.”
For every one purchase of a USD/BTC futures contract, there will be a delivery of one bitcoin into the owner’s account at settlement. That contrasts with the bitcoin futures markets on CBOE and CME, which are cash-settled, meaning that no actual cryptocurrency assets exchange hands at expiration.
Investors in Bakkt’s platform includeMike Novogratz‘s Galaxy Digital,Pantera Capital, and others.

The stock exchange although made it clear the investors won’t be able to buy cryptocurrencies directly, but can only invest in its exchange-listed counterpart.
ЕТС (ехсhаngе-trаdеd соmmоdіtу) аnd ЕТN (ехсhаngе-trаdеd nоtе) are the instruments using which people will be able to invest.
As of now the four new ETPs that will be listed include ETC Issuance,VanEck ETP, 21Shares, and WisdomTree.
The report also added,
“Іn аddіtіоn tо thе ехсhаngе rаtе оf thе twо сrурtосurrеnсіеѕ, whеn іnvеѕtіng іn thеѕе іnѕtrumеntѕ, thеу ѕhоuld аlѕо bе саrеful аbоut thе аnnuаl fееѕ (ТЕR) – іn thе саѕе оf ЕТС Іѕѕuаnсе ВТСЕ, іt іѕ 2% еасh уеаr.”
The stock exchange made the right decision to list the ETPs at the right time as these exchange-traded products have been drawing in a lot of money this month.
According to data from CoinShares, the 21Shares ETF registered inflows of $31.5 million adding to the month’s total of $39.9 million.
Similar performance was visible by the ETC Group’s ETF as it marked $15.5 million worth of inflows. Although the month of January made a big dent in the ETF as its year-to-date outflows currently stand at $127 million.
For the United States alone that is, as Europe recently received its first-ever spotBitcoinETP after Fidelityannouncedthe launch of its cheapest ETP in the world.
On the other hand, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to reject spot Bitcoin ETP proposals citing fraud and manipulation concerns.
Although Bitcoin ETFs do exist in the country all of them are Futures based and not Spot based.
The difference between the two is that a Futures based ETP tracks the price of Bitcoin Futures contracts.
This allows investors who wish to trade BTC through regulatory-friendly mediums to bet on where the price might head.
Spot ETPs on the contrary track the price of Bitcoin in real-time. This however handicaps investors’ ability to short Bitcoin directly. But investors can still instead short the ETF’s share prices, which acts in a similar manner.
Thus until SEC is yet to approve a Spot ETP, investors in the United States will have to suffice with the Futures exchange-traded funds.

Milne, who is well known on Twitter in particular as a source of bullish statements about Bitcoin (BTC), said that any new price highs for the largest cryptocurrency should surpass those of 2017.
“The probability that Bitcoin matches its ATH [all-time high] price again and doesn't then continue past it seems very low. Each wave of adoption is an order of magnitude bigger than the last,” he wrote in a thread on Saturday.
Bitcoin continues to trade around 80 percent lower than at its peak in December 2017, when its price reached more than$20,000on some exchanges.
The persisting downturn has led to multipleaccusationsfrom high-profile economics figures — such as economist Nouriel Roubini — that Bitcoin is trending to zero, an argument proponents, including Milne, contest.
“It takes time for sentiment to change. 30-50million [sic] people owning crypto is not the industry's peak,” Milnecontinued, adding boldly:
“The next bull run will decide which public blockchains persist for the next 100 years. I believe Bitcoin is currently the *only* sure thing[.]”
Milne also highlighted institutional investor interest and Bitcoin’s profile as “gold2.0” in aiding the next round of adoption.
BTC/USD has lost around 5 percent over the past 24 hours, trading just over$3,500by press time.

As CoinDeskreported, customers of WEX â a kind of successor to the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e â have been on tenterhooks since July 12, as they've largely been unable to get outbound payments processed.
The only exceptions have been for the crypto assets tether and zcash (along with lower-volume, lesser-known alternatives like namecoin and novacoin) and the price disparities suggest that some WEX users are utilizing these tokens as a way out. The normally dollar-tied tether, also known as USDT, is currentlyabove$2 andWEX's price forzcashÂ (against the US dollar) is $440, orÂmore than doublethe prevailing rate on the broader market.
Indicator Suggests Bitcoin's $8K Price Rally Could Be Overstretched
Those looking to convert their money held on WEX to zcash or tether just to get it out of the exchange must pay a steep price, according to one customer.
""If you buy zcash on WEX, you will have to sell it somewhere else much cheaper, losing up to 50 percent, as the USDT rate is now $2.195 on WEX,"" Grigory, a systems administrator from a town in Russia called Ivanovo, told CoinDesk. Further, the ability to make withdrawals has become unavailable again from time to time, he added.
In the absence of word from WEX staff, users have taken to social media and the exchange's chat box to wonder aloud about the story behind the delay.
Cryptocurrency prices have risen on the site as well, with the value of bitcoinexceeding $9,600as of press time, or more than $1,400 above the price recorded on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Prior to the withdrawal issues, prices on the exchangehad notably spikedabove $9,000.
Ponzi Games Are Breaking Out on the Ethereum Blockchain
WEX representatives have not responded to multiple requests for comment.
The situation on WEX has been brewing for more than a week, the exchange's own statements show.
On July 12, WEXannouncedon Twitter that withdrawals of fiat and cryptocurrencies were blocked due to the ""database migration and other maintenance.""
Later that day, it was said that maintenance had been completed, and some coins, including zcash and tether (as well asÂ lower-volume coins like namecoin and peercoin), were available for withdrawal. But larger crypto assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, litecoin and dash were to remain unavailable until July 22,accordingto a post on July 16.
The last public message via Twitter waspostedon July 19, saying, ""Maintenance has finished successfully.""
However, when July 23 came, exchange customers kept complaining that withdrawals were still blocked.
""No Withdraw is working. It is 23rd now. Maintenance fail can happen, but no information is worst. After BTCe now WEX?""saiduser @Pete11240362.
""Administrators, if you can't resolve the problem right now, say: maintenance works in process. Get smart, give some feedback,""demandedRussian-speaking user Sergey Ionkin, who goes by the handle @dear_enman.
Some of the affected users took to Telegram to discuss the situation. One of the groups was promoted and possibly created by Dmitry Vassiliev, an official owner and CEO of WEX, who previously told CoinDesk that he lost control over the exchange due to the intervention of some people he declined to identify.
On Monday, a user in one of the channels claiming he is Dmitry Vassiliev â using two similar usernames, (Dmitry Vasiliev and Dmitry wex.nz) â wrote that he had agreed to register the exchange in the name of the new beneficiaries who are already de facto managing WEX.
The user claimed that the deal is going to take place on Thursday, and promised to reveal the names of those beneficiaries if they don't fix the situation on that day. Vassiliev stopped answering CoinDesk's inquiries after a brief exchange on July 12.
According to Grigori, avenues for actually taking money off the exchange exist â but at a price.
Grigory told CoinDesk he has had 0.1 BTC waiting in limbo on WEX since July 12. He said he started using WEX in the end of 2017 because he liked that the exchange didn't require ID verification.
For the most of time everything had worked fine, he explained: he had been able to withdraw coins within an hour or less, and fiat-denominated funds would appear in his e-payment account in several hours after the withdrawal transaction.
But that changed earlier this month, he told CoinDesk. The tech support on WEX has provided no reasonable explanation and only recommended waiting until the maintenance is over, Grigory contended.
Fiat withdrawals were ceased in that period, too, though the ability to withdraw funds via so-called WEX codes remained for a time. Users would generate a special code with their accounts and then exchange those codes for fiat currency on specialized websites, which would sent a corresponding amount of dollars or rubles to users' accounts at Russian payment services like Yandex.Money or Qiwi.
But this is no longer a viable solution, according to Grigory.
""At some point, the offers to buy WEX codes disappeared from those exchange websites as there were enormous numbers of people who wanted to sell them,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:
""Now people who wanted to quit at any price have already quit, but the exchange rate is still bad.""

“The action, effective February 5, enables him to continue to carry out his duties as Chair after the expiration of his term on the same day, and while the confirmation process is underway,” the Fed said in its announcement.
President JoeBiden nominated Powellin November for a second term as Chair of the Board of Governors. His term as a Federal Reserve Board member runs through 2028. Biden also said he will nominate Dr. Lael Brainard to serve as Vice Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, according to a statement on the White House website.
“While there’s still more to be done, we’ve made remarkable progress over the last 10 months in getting Americans back to work and getting our economy moving again,” Biden said in the statement on Nov. 22, 2021. “That success is a testament to the economic agenda I’ve pursued and to the decisive action that the Federal Reserve has taken under Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard to help steer us through the worst downturn in modern American history and put us on the path to recovery.”
The Wall Street Journal reported that the move is largely procedural because the Senate hasn’t voted on his confirmation. The last time a Fed chief’s term expired before a Senate confirmed a new term was in 1996, Reuters confirmed, when the Fed’s board voted to appoint Alan Greenspan as chair pro tempore on Friday, March 1 of that year, the last business day before his term expired. The Senate confirmed his third term as Fed chair on June 20, 1996.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellensaid in a statement in November that “the steady leadership of Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve helped ensure that America’s economy was able to recover from a once-in-a-generation health and economic crisis.”
“Over the past few years, Chair Powell has provided strong leadership at the Federal Reserve to effectively meet and address unexpected economic and financial challenges, and I am pleased our economy will continue to benefit from his stewardship,” Yellen said in the statement. “I am also grateful that the President has nominated Dr. Brainard to serve as Vice Chair. Lael is a respected economist with years of experience and has been instrumental in the nation’s recovery.”

This move comes as more trading platforms allow users to deal in crypto and hacks continue to occur. In a new accounting bulletin published Thursday, the SEC said there are risks with safeguarding crypto assets and noted that crypto assets change hands and prices very quickly, making them different to protect than more traditional financial assets. The SEC also noted there are far fewer regulatory requirements for exchanges or companies holding crypto assets on behalf of users, and that they may not be complying properly with regulations, increasing risks to investors. “These entities and/or their agents may safeguard the platform user’s crypto-assets and also maintain the cryptographic key information necessary to access the crypto-asset,” SEC staff said. “The obligations associated with these arrangements involve unique risks and uncertainties not present in arrangements to safeguard assets that are not crypto-assets, including technological, legal, and regulatory risks and uncertainties.” Representation of Bitcoin is seen with binary code displayed on a laptop screen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on August 17, 2021. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images) The SEC advised that an exchange or company holding cryptographic key information for a user or users’ crypto assets in digital wallets should account for those as a liability at fair value of the crypto assets on their balance sheet and warn investors of the risks of safeguarding those assets. Financial statements should include clear disclosure of the nature and amount of crypto assets that the exchange is responsible for holding for users, with separate disclosures for each crypto asset, and the vulnerabilities the exchange has, the staff wrote. Periodic reports would need to be filed to the SEC. The new rules will apply to all public companies registered with the SEC, starting after June 15. “These risks can have a significant impact on the entity’s operations and financial condition,” the SEC noted. “The staff believes that the recognition, measurement, and disclosure guidance will enhance the information received by investors and other users of financial statements about these risks, thereby assisting them in making investment and other capital allocation decisions.” Story continues Washington DC, USA - October 12, 2018: United States Securities and Exchange Commission. (Photo: Getty Creative) (ablokhin via Getty Images) These rules come as crypto theft continues to burgeon. The most recent hack came earlier this week when the popular blockchain game Axie Infinity, which lets users earn money as they play, said it lost $615 million in a hack—eclipsing the $611 million hack of the DeFi protocol Poly Network in August 2021. Paypal, Square, investing app Robinhood, and crypto exchange Coinbase are just a handful of companies that hold crypto on behalf of their users. As of the end of last year, Coinbase was storing $278 billion in its customers’ digital wallets at the end of 2021, representing approximately 11.5% of the total market capitalization of crypto assets at the time, according to the company’s 10-K filing. “This bulletin is further evidence that the Commission needs to update its regulations concerning custody of digital assets,” Paul Atkins, CEO of Patomak Global Partners and a former SEC commissioner, told Yahoo Financ. “Instead of resorting to staff accounting bulletins to address custody risks, the Commission should update its custody rule to clarify how they apply to digital assets.” The Chamber of Digital Commerce has been calling for crypto accounting standards for years. “It is essential that businesses and investors of all types are able to clearly reflect the value of their assets on their balance sheets,” the organization said.

The firm was founded last year by World Bank veteran Leah Wald and Steven McClurg, formerly of Guggenheim Partners and Galaxy Digital.
Accordingto reports, Valkyrie will use the new financing towards further developing its presence in Nashville. This includes expanding its workforce in its research, trading, compliance, marketing, and sales departments. They will also use the investment to develop their existing product pipeline and broaden their distributions. Furthermore, once conditions allow, Valkyrie hopes to expand its presence in Asia.
Shortly before her company secured its multimillion Series A funding, CEO and co-founder Leah Waldappeared on Bloomberg Technologyto discuss the position of BTC and crypto volatility.
Presenter Emily Chang asked Wald about how she saw the effects on BTC brought on by events in China playing out in the long-term.
“Sentiment around bitcoin is very bearish right now” she said. “Over those worries stemming from the dual threats coming out of China of the mining ban, and also crackdowns on crypto transactions”
The CEO also gave her views on crypto mining rigs relocating to the States. Many displaced miners have moved their operations to statessuch as Texas, while areas inFloridaandWyominghave also issued encouragement.

Four years ago, Donald Trump became the second presidential candidate after George W. Bush in 2000 to lose the popular vote and take the White House. It’s a given that he’ll come up short in the national count this time, too. The outcome hinges on Trump’s ability to keep that deficit narrow enough to secure a second victory in the electoral college. In 2016, Trump prevailed with a relatively low number of total ballots, because third-party candidates amassed a far higher proportion than in most elections, and Trump got the maximum mileage imaginable from his haul by edging Hillary Clinton by less than a point in no fewer than three electoral vote-rich states, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.
To win reelection, Trump needs to immensely boost his performance in the popular vote. Paul Krishnamurty, a professional political gambler and elections expert for the U.K. betting site Betfair––the venue has booked $260 million on the election so far and expects that number to double in the days to come––reckons that Trump must raise his 2016 count of 63 million by roughly 11 million, or 17%, to stand a decent chance. That’s thenetincrease required, meaning as of today, Trump must squeeze enough new votes from his white, blue-collar, non–college-educated base and groups newly leaning his way to make up for his losses among seniors, independents, and disgruntled Republicans,and still add10-plus million to his 2016 total. Trump can get part of the way by rallying his hard core of white working-class voters and notching gains with Latinos impressed by his handling of the economy and tough stance on Cuba.
“He seems to think he can get millions of working-class folks who weren’t enthused enough to vote for him the last time, to vote for him this time,” says Krishnamurty. “Some of them will, but it won’t be nearly enough.” Adds University of Florida professor Michael McDonald, who heads the United States Elections Project, an excellent source for voter turnout data: “Trump’s main strategy is attempting to make Biden appear unlikable, like Hillary Clinton. But that messaging is not getting through.” Trump can only win by somehow broadening his appeal in the last days of the campaign. He’d need tobring home millions of the graying Americansappalled by his management of the COVID crisis, and dampen the suburbanites’ surging enthusiasm for Biden. It’s unclear that claiming the former VP would undermine Social Security and Medicare, or his law and order message pledging to protect homeowners by quelling violence in the cities, get him anywhere near the giant gains in the popular vote needed for victory.
A major problem for Trump is that a big chunk of the electorate shunned both the Republican and Democratic standard-bearers last time because they foundbothof them intensely dislikable. Now, these onetime protesters are back supporting a major candidate because they deem one of the contenders likable, and they’re not suddenly warming to Donald Trump. In 2016, Trump won 63 million votes of the 137 million cast. His total was 3 million short of Clinton’s 66 million, and he trailed her share by 2.1%, 46.1% to 48.2%. The election was highly unusual, because 8 million, almost 6% of the total, went to third-party tickets, notably the Libertarian and Green candidates at 4.5 million and 1.5 million votes, respectively. That 6% is three times the 2% that usually goes to third-party tickets and write-ins and is the non–major-party share expected in this election.
“The 2016 Census reported that a high percentage of Americans didn’t want to vote for a major candidate, because they didn’t like them,” says McDonald. “So they took other options.” He notes that the James Comey letter drove home the narrative that Clinton was secretive and elitist. “It was one of these moments when people’s impressions crystallize,” he says. “But Biden’s approval numbers are much better than Clinton’s.” Trump is clearly trying to lure a big number of the 8 million rebel voters for whom the likability quotient is crucial by painting Biden as a bad guy. “The idea is to motivate people who like or don’t dislike Biden to hold their nose and vote for Trump,” says McDonald. That the strategy isn’t working is evidenced by Biden’s sturdy approval ratings, which in recent Gallup surveys exceeded Trump’s rating by 5 points.
It’s probable, though not certain, that turnout this year will far exceed that in 2016. Trump needs a scenario where sundry more ballots are cast, and where he gets a big proportion of the tens of millions of extra votes, to prevail. It looks now, however, like the lion’s share of the surge will go to Biden. The huge increase in early voting points to a big turnout. According to the Elections Project, 86 million Americans, two-thirds of the total number in 2016, have already voted either by mail or at polling sites. The volume in Texas already exceeds the 2016 total, and over 80% of the people who voted in North Carolina, Arizona, and Florida four years ago have cast their ballots. A Gallup survey from October finds that 69% of registered voters are “more enthusiastic than usual” about the race versus 50% in 2016.
Krishnamurty predicts that turnout could hit 155 million, an 18 million increase over the Trump-Clinton contest. He reckons that to win, Trump would need to get at least 47.5% of that vote to Biden’s 50.5%. (Don’t forget the roughly 2% forecast for mavericks and write-ins.) But just look at how many more ballots he’d need to collect. Of the 155 million votes cast, he’d need to win 73.6 million. That’s 10.6 million more than his 63 million in 2016. “Even at 73.6 million, I don’t think he’d win, but he’d have a shot,” says Krishnamurty. “I’ve been saying he wouldn’t win again from the day he was elected because he’s a divisive candidate, and successful Presidents are unifiers. He doubled down on the strategy of appealing to his base. He’s the greatest showman ever, but he went out and picked fights, and that’s what killed him with the seniors.”
It’s still conceivable that Trump can repeat the sorcery of 2016. But adding almost 11 million votes when he’s losing the 65 and over crowd and doing even more to rile suburban women? Trump needed a bridge to a much broader constituency that he never built, and now it’s a bridge too far.

(PYPL): Hedge Funds Are Bullish On This Cryptocurrency Stock","We recently compiled a list of the20 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stands against the other cryptocurrency stocks.
Crypto has emerged as a major political issue in the US with the campaigns for election going on. Head of Firmwide research Galaxy Digital Alex Thorn called August a rough and seasonally bad week for Bitcoin. He mentioned how eight out of the eleven prior Augusts witnessed the major coin trading down. However, political events have also played a role in the crypto landscape.
In Thorn's opinion, most people view Trump’s victory as bullish for the crypto market. Trump who is now running for President brought the hopes of the crypto world higher by promising to deliver a plan to make the United States the ‘crypto capital of the planet’. Crypto became an even hotter topic as Kamala Haris simultaneously supported policies for the expansion of the industry. In the opinion of Thorn, most people view Trump’s victory as bullish for the crypto market. He predicts crypto will run quite higher if Trump ends up winning the election based on an anticipated easing of the regulations. On the other hand, he expects the victory of Harris to be more neutral even for the industry since those advising her belong to the Biden administration on crypto policy.
Looking forward to September which is a seasonally weak month for crypto too, the next months including October, November, and December are crypto's most bullish months based on the seasonality factor. Regardless of the highly awaited Fed interest rate cuts just ahead of us, the crypto market investors still remain concerned as JPMorgan’s Head of Global and European Equity Strategy dismissed the potential of a crypto bull market. While September has been a historically worst month for US stocks, the upcoming rate cut might be an outlier in history.
In an interview with CNBC, Anthony Pompliano, Professional Capital Management CEO, talked about the recent price moves in Bitcoin. The German government offloading Bitcoin through as many exchanges and the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox unloading coins onto the market are two important events defining this supply. Pompliano refers to Bitcoin as really illiquid with many Bitcoin holders having a long-term view of it. At the start of 2024, the Bitcoin amount that had not moved in more than a year was over 70%. Some of it started to get distributed as prices rose, as expected in a bull market. Although Pompliano expects this percentage to drop to 50% to 55% but still at least half of the Bitcoin would still be in the hands of people who have an over 10-year time horizon. Thus, the question revolves around whether these hands are strong enough to outlast the aforementioned two events. Pompliano finally states time as the only catalyst for Bitcoin rather than a pro-crypto candidate in the upcoming US elections. While the summer season is a bit slow, prices typically go back up in September and beyond.

36595,2021-04-05 18:34:22,"The U.S. to lose 80,000 retail stores by 2026: UBS","Vaccinesare in the arms of around a third of the country (at least the first dose), and people are thinking about returning to aspects of their old lives again, like shopping in stores.
But a reopening bounce for retail might not be a sure thing.
A new report from UBS’s retail analysts suggests that 80,000 stores will close in the U.S. over the next few years.
“We estimate that 80,000 stores will close by 2026 in our base case,” the report found. The worst-case scenario is 150,000 stores closing.
The “enduring legacy” of the pandemic’s effect on retail, as UBS puts it, is the push to online shopping, as fears over the coronavirus as well as stay-at-home orders to prevent transmission have kept many people at home.
In 2020, 17 major retailers filed forbankruptcy– including Lord & Taylor, Century 21 and Brooks Brothers – while others are atrisk of default.
But there is reason for some optimism for retailers, according to Barrie Scardina, head of retail in the Americas at commercial real estate company Cushman & Wakefield. Low rents, landlord and tenant cooperation,economic improvement, consumer confidence,stimulus, and other factors may boost things as we start exiting the pandemic nightmare.
But despite the prospect of getting the pandemic fully under control, UBS expects the shift online to continue. While the pandemic has been hard on stores, the analysts note that many did not close because of the broad business shutdowns to slow Covid-19 transmission. Online retail’s market share of the full retail landscape climbed from 14% in 2019 to 18% in 2020 – an uptick that hasn’t been fully felt by stores.
Other ways to measure this growth show a similar acceleration: Average household spending online has doubled in the past five years and spiked from $5,800 to $7,100 from 2019 to 2020.
Stimulus checks weren't the only thing helping stores. A shift from spending on goods to spending on services provided some relief for stores during the pandemic, and stores provide services more readily than their online counterparts. But like the government stimulus, UBS says the trend won’t likely continue.
At the same time as UBS thinks 80,000 stores will close by 2026, it sees the online market share rise all the way to 27%. But in this future, the landscape will look different in other ways. The analysts expect twice as many brick-and-mortar stores playing double duty – both selling and fulfilling online orders from the same location.
Another way things may change is what retailers are better suited for online and what really need to be in person. Some of retail’s changes might be explained in the long term by efficiency. For home improvement, grocery, and auto parts, for example, UBS doesn’t see much change on the horizon. But for apparel, electronics, and home furnishings, the in-person benefits of trying stuff on and seeing how they look and feel might not be enough to prevent a further shift online.
The forecast for malls is more dire. People have talked about the death of the mall for years, but things actually look particularly bad, with high vacancy rates and the lowest number of new net malls in decades. The mall vacancy rate rose to 10.5% in the fourth-quarter 2020 from 10.1% in the third quarter and 9.7% a year ago,according to Reis Moody’s Analytics.
“Malls will likely continue to provide a source of store closures going forward,” UBS wrote.
Cushman & Wakefield’s Scardina sees a more nuanced picture, however. Though she sees a similar outlook of e-commerce having disproportionate effects on apparel and other sectors, people who run malls and other centers do understand this and look to configure their physical locations accordingly, mixing traditional retail spaces with experiential spaces as well as restaurants and grocery stores.

25017,2018-03-28 18:37:57,India ETFs Among Worst 2018 Performing Markets,"This article was originally published onETFTrends.com.
Some of the worst performing country-specific ETFs of this year cover India's market.
For example, the Market Vectors India Small-Cap Index ETF (SCIF) plunged 16.4%, EGShares India Small Cap ETF (SCIN) declined 16.4%, EGShares India Infrastructure Index Fund (INXX) decreased 12.8% and iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF (SMIN) dropped 10.8% year-to-date.
Meanwhile, theiShares MSCI India ETF (CBOE:INDA), the largest India country-specific ETF, fell 6.5% so far this year, its worst performance to a new year since its inception back in 2012.
A number of factors are dragging on India's economy and equities market. For starters, a newly introduced tax bill on long-term capital gains dissuaded many middle-income Indians from maintaining momentum in the equities market,Bloombergreports.

Starting in April, investors redeeming shares after holding their investments for more than a year will have to pay a 10% levy on all capital gains exceeding Rs100,000, or $1,560. Selling long-term stock investments have been tax free since 2004.
Some observers feared India’s long bull run that has pushed up valuations toward a potential bubble territory could experience a sharp correction if any problems unbalanced the status quo, and finance minister Arun Jaitley did just that when he delivered his fourth annual budget and announced the end of a tax exemption on equity investments from long-term capital gains taxes.
The country could also experience further political risk, especially ahead of elections early next year. Srivathsan Ramachandran, director of institutional equities sales atSpark Capital Advisors, warned that there may be little chance of a turnaround this year.
Furthermore, there has been speculation that a $2 billion bank fraud could sperad and turn into a contagion across India's financial markets.
Meanwhile, lower earnings growth compared to other developing markets has also dragged on foreign investment demand for this emerging Asian market.

Cold storage is a way of holding cryptocurrency tokens offline rather than on an internet-connected exchange.
Todaro sees Arculus becoming one of the top three largest crypto hardware wallet providers by the end of this year, and expects continued material revenue growth from this segment throughout 2023.
CompoSecure could sell 160,000 Arculus units this year and 840,000 units in 2023, Todaro estimated. While Ledger and Trezor will sell more wallets over those years thanks to customer “stickiness,” Todaro thinks the speediest growth will be in Arculus.
Todaro and team see continued growth in private custody, expecting a 6.4% three-year compounded growth rate for bitcoin (BTC) addresses, and a 32.4% growth rate for Ethereum-based addresses.
Todaro initiated CompoSecure with a buy rating and $14 price target, suggesting more than 80% upside from current levels. Shares are down about 7% so far in 2022.

The Legion Strategies fund suspended redemptions because private companies, which are harder to sell, now make up about 20% of the portfolio, one of the people said. The fund is one of Skybridge’s smaller offerings, farming out most of its roughly $230 million of assets to hedge fund managers.
FTX, the crypto exchange co-founded by billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, is among the fund’s private investments.
Scaramucci -- who returned to money management after spending 11 days in the White House as the Trump administration’s communications director -- made a big push into crypto, a move that has hurt Skybridge’s performance this year. An index of the 100 largest digital assets has tumbled 56% in 2022.

The Legion Strategies fund gained exposure to digital assets through other funds managed by Skybridge, including vehicles focused on Bitcoin, Ethereum and Algorand, according to a regulatory filing. As of Feb. 28, almost a quarter of Legion’s net assets were invested in such fund.
Skybridge runs a larger fund-of-funds, the Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios, which managed about $2 billion as of March 31, according to a separate filing. That fund fell about 5.5% for the year through March 31.
Redemptions for that fund are made through a tender offer by Skybridge. The firm told clients it will buy back 10% of the fund’s shares at the end of September, the next time investors are allowed to pull money, one of the people said.
A representative for New York-based Skybridge didn’t reply to messages seeking comment.

Jan 12 (Reuters) - Crypto asset manager Bitwise said on Friday that $240 million flowed into its spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the most of the 10 such products that began trading on Thursday.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs this week, including BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, among others, after a decade-long tussle with the digital asset industry. The first day of trading saw $4.6 billion worth of shares trade hands across all the products, according to LSEG data from Thursday which tracks total trading activity, including inflows and outflows. Reuters could not immediately verify Bitwise's data.
Grayscale, BlackRock and Fidelity dominated total trading on Thursday, the LSEG data showed.
The products mark a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry that is set to test whether digital assets - still viewed by many professionals as risky - can gain broader acceptance as an investment. The market is closely watching inflows during their first few days of trading.
The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, the first bitcoin futures ETF approved by the SEC in 2021, accumulated $1 billion in assets within its first days of trading.
""Matching BITO's first-week performance would indeed signify a significant success, especially given the current state of the market cycle,"" said Anthony Rousseau, head of brokerage solutions at TradeStation.
Grayscale was approved to convert its existing bitcoin trust into an ETF on Thursday, overnight creating the world's largest bitcoin ETF, with more than $28.6 billion in assets under management. Its product saw $95 million in outflows on Thursday, according to a source familiar with the matter.
The SEC had previously rejected all spot bitcoin ETFs on investor protection concerns. SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement on Wednesday that the approvals were not an endorsement of bitcoin, calling it a ""speculative, volatile asset.""
Still, the regulatory nod sparked intense competition for market share among the issuers.
Franklin Templeton on Friday slashed the fee for its bitcoin ETF to 0.19% - the lowest yet - and waived fees entirely on the product's first $10 billion in assets under management until August.
After its ETF started trading on Thursday, Valkyrie cut its fees a second time to 0.25%. Its Valkyrie Bitcoin ETF saw $29.44 million flow in during its first day of trading, the company said. Reuters could not immediately verify that number.
Valkyrie CEO Leah Wald, speaking to Reuters after the market close on Thursday, called it ""a good successful trading day."" (Reporting by Hannah Lang in Washington and Suzanne McGee; Editing by Michelle Price, Kirsten Donovan)",43854.01,0.1,43856.0,0.1,43445.09,-0.83,43390.0,-0.96,43810.0

Citing people familiar with the plans, the publication revealed Facebook was currently talking to major payment networksVisaandMasterCardabout potential support, along with payment processor First Data Corp.
The cryptocurrency project, dubbed “FB Coin,” has fuelled rumors for around a year that Facebook wants to provide in-house payments to users. As more information trickles down to the outside, it appears various options are under consideration by executives, including payments via a user’s Facebook profile.
“Facebook is also talking to e-commerce companies and apps about accepting the coin, and would seek smaller financial investments from those partners, one of the people said,” the WSJ added.
As Cointelegraphreported, interest in a fiat-centric FB Coin has already reportedly come from within cryptocurrency circles, specifically in the form of VC investment mogulTim Draper.
Last month, plans surfaced that Draper, who is awell-knownbitcoin (BTC) bull and supporter of altcoin Tezos (XTZ), would meet with Facebook to discuss investment options.
According to the WSJ sources, however, the hugefiatbacking is further deliberately designed to remove perceived doubts about FB Coin versus bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Volatility, they said, should be avoided in order to boost uptake.

91399,2025-03-11 09:00:00,"Crypto's Brutal Weeks Might Be Over. Here's What to Buy With $1,000.","It is an understatement to say that it hasn't been a good few weeks forBitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC),XRP(CRYPTO: XRP),Solana(CRYPTO: SOL), and other crypto assets. Between the opening skirmishes of a trade war, major new cryptocurrency policy and enforcement announcements, increasingly chaotic domestic politics, and simmering geopolitical instability, there are a lot of good reasons for investors to be concerned about the entire sector right now.
Fortunately, there are some powerful drivers in play that could reverse the damage and push the leading cryptos higher than ever. That means it's time to start to consider nibbling on certain coins with small investments on the scale of $1,000. Here's what to buy and why it's likely to hold up despite what could happen next.
First, let's assess the damage. Take a glance at this chart:
As you can see, this isn't normal price action for any of these coins. The intense spike on March 2 into March 3 was the result of the announcement of the U.S. national cryptocurrency reserve, which is set to include all three of these assets, along with at least a couple of others.
And it's important to note that, even while the details of how the reserve will work are still in flux, the advancement of the policy will certainly be a major driver of higher values for Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana over the long term. So, this choppiness, as painful as it is, does not necessarily portend a deeper downturn, considering the strength of the positive catalyst now at work.
Nonetheless, the crash immediately after the crypto reserve announcement was caused by the Trump administration's determination that it would follow through with implementingtariffsagainst crucial trading partners like Mexico and Canada, and that it would be increasing the scale of the newly proposed tariffs on other crucial trade partners like China. The announcement of reciprocal tariffs from Canada and China certainly didn't help the markets feel comfortable, either.
It's important for investors to understand that there isn't necessarily any direct mechanism for the tariffs to make these coins less valuable. Bitcoin isn't used as a medium for international trade, nor is Solana.
The tariffs might make it more expensive to import mining hardware for cryptocurrencies in general, but there's not much reason that activity needs to occur in the U.S. instead of another country, where costs are lower. And for XRP, newtariffs could well be a driverfor its target users -- financial institutions making international transfers -- to try to cut their transfer and currency exchange costs, which would lead to wider adoption of the coin.
So, given that a lot of the negativity is driven by sour sentiment about the U.S. economy at large rather than anything specific to the investment theses for these cryptocurrencies, now is the time for brave investors to start looking for opportunities to load up on cheap assets.
Sentiment will improve eventually. The question is whether you'll have made use of the period when the mood was bad to pave the way for your portfolio's growth.
Make no mistake: Bitcoin, and especially XRP and Solana, could have a lot further to fall. The more that unexpected economic events occur, the more investors will dump their coins and shift to assets that are perceived as safer. The presence of a crypto-friendly administration in the U.S., with a looser regulatory approach and broad policy support, might be enough to mitigate the negative impact -- or maybe not. It isn't possible to know in advance.
But if you're investing for the long term, which you should, you shouldn't really mind being underwater on the purchases you make today, even if it takes a few years for them to recover.
The move here is to initiate dollar-cost averaging for Bitcoin if you're a conservative type, and for XRP and Solana if you're comfortable with a bit more risk. Allocating $1,000 to one or spreading it across all of these coins would be a good starting point.
Just make sure to deploy your funds gradually. And, if things get really bad in the near term, there's always the option of buying the dip and then not checking your portfolio for a few weeks.

97939,2024-04-27 08:40:00,Bitcoin Just Halved Its Mining Reward. Here's Why I'm Buying Now,"On the evening of April 19, the much-anticipatedBitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC)halving finally took place. Crypto investors around the world celebrated, and for good reason. There have been three previous halving events, and each one has resulted in a new bull market cycle for Bitcoin.
So is thehalvinggoing to send the price of Bitcoin soaring again this year? I think so, and here's why.
Many investors may not realize this, but Bitcoin was actually created as a backlash to the financial crisis of 2008.Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, blamed irresponsible fiscal and monetary policy for the crisis, and sought to create a new type of digital asset that would be ""sound money.""
With that in mind, Nakamoto built the unique halving mechanism into the original Bitcoin algorithm. A halving occurs after 210,000 blocks have been added to the Bitcoin blockchain, and that's approximately once every four years. As soon as the 210,000th block has been added, the mining reward for adding any new blocks is cut in half.
Another way to think about this is that Bitcoin is the only asset in the world with its own monetary policy. The halving mechanism carefully controls how much new Bitcoin can be created at any time. It also places a hard cap on how much Bitcoin can ever be created, which is 21 million coins.
All this is done to make Bitcoin as inflation-resistant as possible, a feat that even the most talented central bankers have never fully mastered. According toCoinbase Global(NASDAQ: COIN), Bitcoin is now a ""programmatically disinflationary asset."" In other words, Bitcoin is literally programmed to resist inflation. So, if you are looking for a long-term store of value, it's Bitcoin.
The second reason I'm buying Bitcoin is because there is a very high probability that Bitcoin will soar in value after April 19. There have been three previous Bitcoin halving cycles, and in each one, Bitcoin has soared to a new all-time high. Some of the gains have been truly astounding. For example, in the previous halving cycle, Bitcoin soared from $10,000 in May 2020 to $69,000 in November 2021.
Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future performance, so there is a chance that Bitcoin may not soar as high in value this time around. Coinbase recently modeled the results of the three previous halving cycles, and found that the effect of each halving appears to be diminishing over time. This makes sense, given that we're getting closer and closer to the 21 million hard cap, with 19.7 million bitcoins currently in circulation.
But there is something very different this time around with the fourth Bitcoin halving, and that's the recent introduction of the new spot Bitcoin ETFs. This introduces an entirely new source of Bitcoin demand, and will likely help to prop up the price of Bitcoin if there is any selling pressure after the halving. In fact, some crypto traders think that we're already facing a potential ""supply squeeze"" in terms of available Bitcoin, and the halving could force the price of Bitcoin higher, simply on the basis of supply and demand.
All this leads me to think that we're going to get a similar type of price dynamic to what we've seen in past Bitcoin halving cycles. According to Coinbase, Bitcoin rallied 923% in the six months after the first halving, 37% in the six months after the second halving, and 82% in the six months after the third halving. So it's certainly within the realm of possibility that Bitcoin might pass the $100,000 level sometime this year. Given Bitcoin's current price of $65,000, that would imply a rally of approximately 50%.
As Bitcoin goes increasingly mainstream, it should start to behave more and more like a traditional financial asset. That means less volatility, more correlation with stocks and bonds, and greater price dependence on the overall macroeconomic environment. As a result, there could be less explosive upside than we're used to seeing with Bitcoin in previous halving cycles.
While Bitcoin may no longer be able to 100x or 1,000x in value as easily as it once did, it should still be able to increase 10x in price over the next decade. And that could be a conservative estimate. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest now thinks Bitcoin is going to blow past the $1 million price level sometime before 2030.So, if you're thinking about investing in Bitcoin, buckle up and enjoy the ride.

In dollar terms, China is already the largest emerging markets dividend payer. But as highlighted by a dividend yield of 1.94% on the MSCI China Index, there’s room for payout growth in the world’s second-largest economy.
In fact, that’s exactly what the government there wants to see. The China Securities Regulatory Commission recently said it wants Chinese companies to boost shareholder rewards, both buybacks and dividends. It's promised to increase scrutiny of those firms that aren’t engaging in either practice.
Should more Chinese companies decide to comply with that demand, ETFs such as theWisdomTree Emerging Markets High Dividend Fund (DEM)could benefit. The $2.58 billion fund allocates nearly 20% of its weight to Chinese stocks, second only to its exposure to Taiwan.
DEM, which is about 16.5 years old, allocates nearly 45% of its weight to financial services and energy stocks. In developing economies, those sectors often feature large exposure to companies that are considered state-owned enterprises. That means the governments are those firms’ largest shareholders.
It’s often said that governments’ interests aren’t always aligned with those of other market participants. But there’s also credibility to the assertion that governments, particularly in emerging markets, can be forces for good when it comes to fostering dividend growth.
“China has taken a tougher stance on firms that refuse to issue dividends to investors over the years. In 2017, then-CSRC Chairman Liu Shiyusaidthe regulator would take steps against ‘those iron roosters which have the ability to offer cash dividends but never plucked a feather,’”reported Bloomberg.
The regulatory agency is also asking Chinese firms to increase the frequency of dividend payments and smooth out interim payouts. As investors in the U.S. know, dividend-paying companies bashed here typically deliver payouts on a quarterly basis. But many dividend payers in international markets may only deliver two payouts per year.
Even without the cajoling of Beijing, there’s still credibility to the China dividend story and it’s potentially rewarding for DEM investors. Data indicates Chinese dividends could hit all-time highs this year and, amid depressed valuations, Hong Kong-listed companies are boosting buyback programs.
“Leading the dividend payouts this year are some of China’s biggest state-owned banks, Bloomberg-compiled data shows. They are followed by oil producer PetroChina and liquor maker Kweichow Moutai,”reportedThe Business Times.
Several Chinese banks and PetroChina are members of the DEM portfolio.

93612,2024-03-20 10:50:00,Will Shiba Inu Overtake Dogecoin in Market Cap?,"Shiba Inu(CRYPTO: SHIB)has been one of the hottest cryptocurrencies to buy this year. Since the start of 2024, the meme token has more than doubled in value, performing even better thanBitcoin, the world's biggest crypto, which is up about 50%. Cryptocurrencies have benefited from growing optimism after regulators approved the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier this year.
As its value has risen, Shiba Inu's market cap is now more than $15 billion. It's still roughly $4 billion away from the next largest meme coin,Dogecoin(CRYPTO: DOGE), which has a market cap of about $19 billion. Can Shiba Inu catch up?
The risk and upside for meme token investors is that a lot often comes back to momentum, whether it's Dogecoin or Shiba Inu. With meme cryptos, speculation fuels much of the excitement surrounding their valuation. In the past, even a tweet fromTeslaChief Executive Officer and crypto enthusiast Elon Musk has been enough to send a meme token surging. One thing that Shiba investors are excited about now is the possibility of an ETF.
There's been a petition from the Shiba Inu community for Grayscale Investments, the company behind one of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, to launch an ETF for Shiba, which would undoubtedly lead to more interest and potentially more bullishness in the meme coin. But Bitcoin's spot ETF has only recently been approved, and No. 2 cryptoEthereumis still waiting on approval for its own spot ETF, so it could be a while before No. 11 Shiba Inu gets one -- assuming it does at all.
However, it's easy to see the optimism. Money has been flowing rapidly into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Net inflows were about $2.6 billion last week, up 15% from the previous week. Investors have been eagerly buying up spot Bitcoin ETFs, and if Shiba Inu were to get a similar ETF of its own, the meme token's momentum could accelerate even faster.
For Shiba Inu to overtake Dogecoin in market cap, it would need to rise by about 25%. Dogecoin has returned almost 50% this year -- which roughly matches Bitcoin's return -- and it hasn't been outpacing the top cryptocurrency like Shiba Inu has.
This suggests there's added momentum behind Shiba Inu's coin, and if the bullishness in crypto continues this year, Shiba Inu could continue to outperform and rise further in value. Rising higher than Dogecoin certainly wouldn't be out of the question.
Shiba Inu is an incredibly volatile crypto. Even withcrypto investments, which are risky to begin with, Shiba Inu stands out as extremely risky and volatile. Within just the first three months of this year, its market cap has seesawed between $5 billion and $22 billion. Although bullish investors will want to believe that this time, Shiba Inu's trajectory is going higher, there is no guarantee this latest rally will prove sustainable.
If you want to take a chance on this cryptocurrency, be prepared for the possibility of incurring significant losses, and only invest money you can afford to lose. If you're a risk-averse investor or investing for retirement, there aremuch safer growth investments to consider.

38910,2019-05-13 13:30:00,"Ampleforth Publishes Updated White Paper for Non-Correlated, Price-Stable Digital Asset","Ampleforth — the developer of a new synthetic commodity designed to diversify risk — has released an updated white paper for its digital asset protocol. Thepaperwas shared with Cointelegraph in an email on May 13.
Citing prior researchers, the white paper’s co-authors define a synthetic commodity as “money that has absolute scarcity but lacks non-monetary use value"" — whose possibility was heralded by the innovation ofblockchaintechnology back in 2008.
According to the press release, the design for the Ample token — expected to be traded under the ticker symbol AMPL — is intended to resist price correlation with both traditional assets and large market-cap cryptocurrencies such asbitcoin(BTC).
As Ampleforth notes, while cryptocurrencies as a sector have thus far broadly shown non-correlation with traditional asset groups and macroeconomic factors, within the crypto market itself, many large-cap coins have ostensibly shown strong correlation with one another.
This strong intra-crypto market correlation makes it difficult for investors to minimize risk for their portfolio by ensuring their investments are distributed across assets which have low covariance (correlation).
Ampleforth thus hopes that its protocol design — which propagates nominal exchange-rate information into token supply — will result in lower intra-market correlation for its token, thereby mitigating non-diversifiable risk for crypto investors. The press release outlines that:
“The Ampleforth protocol [...] receives exchange-rate information from trusted oracles, and propagates that to holders of Amples by proportionally increasing or decreasing the number of tokens each individual holds, according to the magnitude of the exchange rate fluctuations over the previous 24 hrs.”
The new asset is furthermore designed to mitigate volatility — yet is distinct from a fiat-pegged stablecoin, with the white paper outlining the algorithmic basis upon which the token’s supply policy will prospectively result in minimal price pattern deviations.
As previouslyreported, Ampleforth countsBritisheconomic and financial historian Niall Ferguson as a member of its advisory board. It has reportedly thus far raised $4.75 million in funding to finalize development of its protocol from investors that includeCoinbaseco-founder and CEOBrian Armstrong, True Ventures, Founder Collective, Slow Ventures,Panteraand FBG.
In stablecoin news this week,Coinbase-backed Reserve hasannouncedthat they will soon launch a crypto-fiat payments app inVenezuelaand Angola. Facebook’s rumored stablecoin may also bereleasedas soon as quarter three of this year, according to anonymous sources.

59499,2021-06-03 07:57:55,"Turkey: Political Interference At Central Bank, Weak Lira Risk Policy Mistakes Ahead Of Elections","Structural depreciation oflira– averaging 17% annual losses against the dollar since 2015 – and increased state intervention to slow currency devaluation have reduced the domestic sector’s confidence in the lira.
The proliferation of cryptocurrencies as investors seek protection is a sign of a growing currency crisis. Unless the authorities reverse policy missteps, growing domestic loss of trust in the currency risks structurally higher inflation and balance of payment problems longer term.
However, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s removal last month of a third senior member of the central bank’s powerful Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in two months underscores ever greater political interference in monetary policy making. Erdoğan commented publicly of his expectations of a return to single-digit inflation and interest rates this year, and cited on Tuesday July or August as a possible timetable for rates to begin declining.
By stacking the MPC with figures who favour reduced rates, the president has raised the stakes for forthcoming central bank meetings – starting with the session due 17 June. While new central-bank governor Şahap Kavcıoğlu and his deputies will be given some time from the president, the president’s patience is waning.
Pressure for more accommodative monetary policy remains at odds with Turkey’s high inflation rate, running at an annual 16.6% in May. Any easing of Turkey’s currently significant positive real benchmark interest rate of 2.1% could make the economy more vulnerable to capital outflows, lira depreciation and higher inflation.
The central bank is in a bind: it may have a tacit mandate to hold rates unchanged for a short period, but likely does not have one to hike rates should this be later required.
Policy missteps are partially a function of Erdoğan’s attention on the latest opinion polling. They suggest all-time lows in support for the president’s AK Party and rising popularity of the President’s possible rivals in the next presidential elections – such as Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu and Ankara Mayor Mansur Yavaş.
In view of the criticism of the management of the economy, the president feels pressure to reverse the course of the economy during this Covid-19 crisis. Unfortunately, in the past, Erdoğan has given priority under such conditions to supporting higher short-run economic growth, rather than seeking to correct underlying economic imbalances and achieve sustainable longer-term growth.
GDP expanded 7% YoY in the first quarter, supported by lira lending growth of 25% YoY in April.
Importantly, Erdoğan is unlikely to simply step aside in next elections. If he cannot engineer higher economic growth and higher employment to reverse declining popularity, he could resort to more significant oppression of his political opponents, intensifying economic and institutional risks ahead of the vote by 2023.
The degradation of economic policy making has led to some decline in central bank foreign-currency reserves – after more than USD 100bn of reserves were spent in defence of lira in 2020 alone. Gross reserves stood at USD 92.4bn on 23 May – roughly unchanged from levels as of end-2020 – but swap-adjusted net reserves remained near all-time lows atnegativeUSD 54.3bn in April.
In part, loss of official reserves has reflected impact of the pandemic on tourism revenues, contributing to deterioration in the current-account balance to -5% of GDP in the year to March 2021 from a 1.7% of GDP surplus in the year to August 2019.
It is difficult to see how structural deterioration in fundamentals could be easily reversed with Erdoğan increasingly in the driver’s seat over economic policy.

The app will be officially discontinued on March 16.
“We are sunsetting our consumer App because it is not core to our B2B2C approach,” Bakkt’s Chief Sales & Marketing Officer Mark Elliot toldDecrypt. “This approach ensures we are supporting the relationship our partners and clients have with their customers, rather than competing in any way.”
Launchedin March 2021 as aBitcoin-only product, withEthereumsupportaddedlater that same year, Bakkt’s consumer app sought to allow users to buy and sell crypto, purchase gift cards, as well as to spend their coins in shops to aggregate rewards. Some of the more than 200 brands that partnered with Bakkt includedStarbucks, Best Buy, Choice Hotels, Fiserv, and GolfNow.
Bakkt Launches Mobile App for Bitcoin Holding and Spending
Today’s announcement follows Bakkt’sagreementto acquire crypto trading platform Apex Crypto from Apex Fintech Solutions in November last year in a $200 million deal. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2023 and is subject to regulatory approvals, with Bakkt saying at the time that the acquisition will “significantly bolster” the company’s cryptocurrency product offering “and expand its footprint into additional client verticals including fintechs, trading app platforms, and neo-banks.”
Despite the shift, Bakkt’s new offering will still include some of the existing app’s functionality, with users being able “to view their cash and crypto balances, buy and sell crypto, withdraw cash to a qualifying bank account and access crypto transaction reports for their tax purposes,” said Elliot.
According to the company’ssummary of changes, the Bakkt Visa debit card will decline new transactions starting March 16, as well as the ability to send cash or crypto to a friend, purchase and manage gift cards, and track loyalty programs and track points.
“Going forward, the web platform may also be utilized by crypto rewards and crypto payout customers to manage their crypto, but that will be determined on a case by case basis because many partners opt for fully embedded experiences,“ Ellit toldDecrypt.

65942,2022-08-11 14:14:12,Polkadot Now Has a Decentralized Version of 'Wrapped' Bitcoin,"Interlay, a decentralized stablecoin network, has launched InterBTC (iBTC) – a wrapped bitcoin token. Wrapped tokens are synthetic (or tokenized) versions of crypto assets not native to the blockchains they exist on. iBTC was launched onPolkadot, a network that allows different blockchains to communicate with each other. One iBTC can be redeemed directly on the Bitcoin blockchain for one BTC (1:1 redemption ratio). The wrapped token allows bitcoin to be used for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on Polkadot via a bridge (a system connecting one blockchain to another).
While several brands of wrapped bitcoin exist, the most popular one is anERC-20version aptly namedwrapped bitcoin(wBTC).BitGo,KyberandRencreated wBTC in 2019 and it now dominates the wrapped bitcoin market. According to Dune, a crypto data analytics site, wBTCaccounts for almost 85%of all wrapped bitcoin on Ethereum.
Read more:What Are Wrapped Tokens?
The wBTC ecosystem has two key players – merchants and custodians. Users exchange regular bitcoin for wBTC with merchants like Kyber,Rhino.Fi(formerly DeversiFi) and Ren. Merchants have relationships with custodians who receive and hold that regular bitcoin and mint one wBTC for each bitcoin deposited with them. The minted wBTC token is sent to the user who can redeem the underlying bitcoin at any time. Redemption involves returning the wBTC token to the merchant, who then requests the bitcoin collateral from the custodian. Finally, the custodian burns the wBTC token and releases the bitcoin to the merchant and user.
The traditional wBTC ecosystem has one glaring weakness – centralization. In order to obtain wBTC, users must give bitcoin custody to trusted third parties. Given therecent developmentsin the DeFi community, a more decentralized and trustless solution would be significantly better.
Interlay claims iBTC is that better solution. Apparently, iBTC is built on a trustless model that borrows its security from the token’s target blockchains (in this case, Bitcoin and Polkadot). The model uses decentralized vaults that hold collateral, instead of relying on third-party merchants and custodians.
Interlay followed inMakerDAO’sfootsteps by incorporatingovercollateralized and decentralizedvaults. The vaults are run by members of the Interlay community who must deposit multi-asset collateral (e.g. bitcoin,USDC,DOT) as insurance (in case the vault fails). According to Interlay, the overcollateralization gives iBTC astablecoin-like quality (wrapped tokens and stablecoins have similar mechanics).
Users deposit bitcoin into the vaults in exchange for iBTC. At this point, the bitcoin is locked in the vault while vault collateral is locked by the Interlay network. Users then return iBTC to the vault, thereby unlocking and releasing their bitcoin, which triggers the Interlay network to release vault collateral. If a vault fails to return bitcoin to a user, the network liquidates vault collateral and reimburses the user.

91191,2023-08-01 11:44:29,What is Worldcoin? Sam Altman's Eye-Scanning Global ID 'Orb' Project Explained,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has developed at a furious pace—and has become undeniably proficient at everything fromcreating visual effects in television shows and moviestowriting and producing award-winning pop songstocoming up with new memes. While the benefits andchallengesof AI for early adopters are many, even those outside of the AI world must reckon with the possibility that online activity, text, art, or other types of content may have been computer generated. The power to create endlessly inventive and human-like content is tremendous, but the dangers ofdeepfakes and counterfeitsare also very real.
This is where Worldcoin hopes to step in. Launched in late July 2023 by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Worldcoin has introduced a concept called “proof of personhood.” Users verify their “personhood” in the Worldcoin ecosystem in order to participate in its global financial network. The company said just two days after launch that new users were entering its system at an average rate of every 7.6 seconds, indicating substantial growth, with about 2 million users already registered in total. Below, we take a closer look at Worldcoin and what it might mean for crypto and AI enthusiasts alike.
“Worldcoin” can refer to multiple interrelated things. Primarily, it is a digital identification platform, though it may also refer to a crypto token of the same name. One of Worldcoin’s goals is to create a massive network of users that have verified that they are humans, rather than bots or AI algorithms.
In order to confirm your personhood through the Worldcoin platform, users must acquire a WorldID, a riff on the concept of Global ID. WorldID is the fundamental “proof of personhood” that Worldcoin’s developers have touted, available to users who have had their irises scanned by a device called the Orb.
Irises, like fingerprints, are distinct for every person on earth. Thus, when the Orb scans a person’s eyes and generates an identification code based on the structure of the irises, it is necessarily going to be a distinct code from anyone else. This so-called IrisCode is generated and then saved on Worldcoin’s decentralized blockchain, set up to ensure that no one is able to fraudulently create or manipulate an existing IrisCode. The scans of the iris are anonymized so as to be untraceable to a particular person but to still ensure that no one can duplicate the process and receive a second IrisCode.
Once a user has an IrisCode, Worldcoin’s platform then issues a WorldID and deletes the images of user irises. Because the info is secured on the blockchain, users do not need to scan their eyes every time they participate in platform activities in order to verify their identities.
Worldcoin has launched Orbs in many major cities across Asia, Europe, North and South America, and Africa, among other regions. In the U.S., some of the first Orbs were made available in San Francisco and New York, with others anticipated in the coming months. The company aims to have 1,500 orbs available in 35 cities around the globe by later this year.
The eye scanners and ID codes are simply the first (although likely most talked-about)part of the Worldcoin platform. Users should also familiarize themselves with the World App. The central repository for WorldIDs, World App can be seen as a combination of a cryptocurrency wallet, something like a two-factor authentication service, and a portal to a variety of other apps and offerings.
World App’s primary function is to maintain user credentials, allowing users to remain private but verified through the platform’s ID system. The World App functions as a type of gateway to a growing number of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, with the benefit that users can be sure that they are interacting with others who have similarly been verified to be truly human. By possessing a WorldID and World App, users can participate in networks with a greatly reduced risk of so-calledSybil attacks, in which a single user creates multiple pseudonymous accounts in order to gain power in a virtual system.
The World App can also hold a limited array of different crypto tokens. As of launch, users can store Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC through their World Apps. Worldcoin’s developers have saidthat users should expect more crypto tokens to be supported in the future.
Besides the app and the aforementioned tokens, users also have access to the cryptocurrency WLD, also known as Worldcoin. Surrounding the launch of Worldcoin, WLD made headlines when the millions of users who took part in the ecosystem’s beta program received an airdrop of WLD. WLD trades are supported by a growing number of crypto exchanges, including major players like Binance and KuCoin.
At launch time, 143 million WLD were circulating, with 43 million of those given out to beta participants and the remainder going to market makers to create liquidity. Eventually, a total of 10 billion WLD will be issued, though this process is planned to take 15 years. Notably, Worldcoin aims to provide WLD to anyone who participates in the ID verification process. This has been one of its major marketing tools, particularly early on in its development.
Worldcoin is developed by a company called Tools for Humanity. Notably, one of the co-founders of Tools for Humanity—Sam Altman—is also CEO of OpenAI, the company behind the wildly popular ChatGPT chatbot. Altman’s work with OpenAI has likely driven demand for new AI applications and algorithms, thereby also increasing the issues related to verifying personhood that Tools for Humanity aims to address.
Even before it launched, Worldcoin had received ample criticism. In April 2022 an article published in the MIT Technology Review accused the project of using “deceptive marketing practices, [collecting[ more personal data than it acknowledged, and [failing] to obtain meaningful informed consent,” potentially in violation of data protection guidelines in place in Europe and elsewhere in the world. Eventually, the U.K. Information Commission said it would make inquiries into Worldcoin for possible violations of data security protocols.
Worldcoin’s developers issued a response to the criticisms found in the MIT Technology Review. The company said it is “not a data company” and that it is “only interested in a user’s uniqueness…not their identity.” Worldcoin has also been criticized for marketing its ecosystem heavily in underdeveloped nations.
In May of 2023, just two months prior to launch, TechCrunch revealed that hackers had installed malware allowing them to access the dashboard typically only available to the people Worldcoin employs as Orb operators. These operators are responsible for scanning new users with Orbs to collect their biometric data and are compensated for each new user they scan. A spokesperson for Worldcoin said that no sensitive or personal data was accessed or compromised.
Shortly after it launched, Worldcoin’s price shot upward but then slumped, a trajectory that CoinDesk attributed to widespread hesitation among members of the cryptocurrency community. This hesitation may be due in large part to a blog post by Ethereum co-founderVitalik Buterinshortly after launch.Buterin said he was concernedthat the company may be collecting more information from users with its iris scans than it let on. He also suggested that someone could potentially scan another person’s iris to determine if they have a WorldID. Buterin also pointed to the small number of Orbs spaced around the globe as being a hurdle to widespread adoption. Finally, he said that a risk of centralization in the Worldcoin ID-creating process could allow bad actors to potentially gain control of Orbs to create false World IDs. Still, Buterin acknowledged that a successful proof of personhood verification system would likely be very valuable.
Another potential reason for hesitation among the crypto community is the fact that it has received backing from some problematic names in the space.Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, andcollapsed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capitalboth invested in Tools for Humanity’s Series A funding round.
Meanwhile, crypto analyst Dylan LeClair of Bitcoin Magazine accused Worldcoin’s developers of “taking a page out ofSBF Solanaeco playbook, launching and pumping amicrocap shitcoinwith 1% of total supply in circulation.”",28883.25,0.01,28879.82,0.0,28870.0,-0.03,28892.49,0.04,28879.82
52102,2023-01-12 20:15:53,3 High-Growth Stocks With Multibagger Potential,"Investors are clearly concerned about the current macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop. Recent inflation-driven events have led us to a precarious place in the markets. Accordingly, with a potential recession on the horizon, few investors may be on the search for high-growth stocks. That makes sense. But, generally speaking, the time to buy beaten-down names is when they’re cheap.
Of course, high-growth stocks in areas such as technology may continue to see declines in the year to come. As valuation compression takes hold and investors diversify into other areas of the economy, singularly-focused growth investors may continue to be hit.
That said, I think there are pockets of the stock market worth exploring, such as energy and real estate, which most investors would not equate to growth areas, that provide some hefty bargains. Not only that, these companies tend to deliver significant bottom-line growth. And in this economy, profits matter more than anything else.
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Here are three high-growth stocks I think are worth buying right now.
[{""OXY"": ""TH"", ""Occidental Petroleum"": ""Target Hospitality"", ""$65.71"": ""$18.06""}, {""OXY"": ""MRO"", ""Occidental Petroleum"": ""Marathon Oil"", ""$65.71"": ""$27.58""}]

Occidental Petroleum(NYSE:OXY) may not be included in a list of high-growth stocks for many investors, but it nevertheless deserves a look.
Shares of this leading oil and gas player have performed pretty well so far this year, up more than 4%. This follows a 119% advance in 2022.
Aprominent Warren Buffett holding, Occidental has seen continued interest, even as energy prices have come down from their highs. It’s easy to see why Buffett is on the Occidental train. The company’searnings growthhas been impressive.
Occidental is expected to report fourth-quarter and full-year results on Feb. 23. Analysts are predicting Q4 EPS of $1.97 and 2022 EPS of $9.83. If Occidental meets those targets, it will deliver year-over-year growth of 33% and 285%, respectively.
Accordingly, this is a stock I think deserves to be put in the high-growth bucket by long-term investors.

The previously announced exchange offer for all ofTarget Hospitality’s(NASDAQ:TH) outstanding warrantshas closed. For this leader in providing vertically integrated modular lodging and hospitality services, that’s a big positive investors are starting to price into the stock. Shares are up 19% since the start of the year.
A total of 8,097,893 exercisable warrants (which includes 369,471 warrants tendered through assured delivery), representing approximately 50.1% of the warrants, were correctly tendered and not withdrawn in the offer. Target exchanged these warrants for 2,996,201 shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of the offer. That leaves 8,068,656 warrants still outstanding after the offer has closed.
For the third quarter, Target Hospitality postedrecord quarterly revenueof$159.6 million, an increase of 79% from the corresponding period in 2021. For the same period, net income of $19 million surged 184% from a year ago.
Currently, Target Hospitality stock is trading around the $18 level with the potential to go much higher this year.

Marathon Oil(NYSE:MRO) is another top energy name making this list of high-growth stocks to buy. Like Occidental, the company’s bottom-line growth prospects are what makes it worth buying. So far this year, shares are up around 2% after gaining 67% in 2022.
I think the company’s upcoming earnings report, scheduled for Feb. 15, may exceed investor expectations. Marathon is expected to earn 96 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2022, up 25% year over year. However, if it is able to produce similar bottom-line results to Occidental, this is a name that could get more love. Meanwhile, while Q4 revenue is expected to increase less than 2% compared with a year ago, full-year revenue is projected to surge nearly 46%.
In addition, Marathon Oil recently disclosed that, after accounting for closing adjustments, it had successfullycompleted the acquisitionofEnsign Natural Resources’Eagle Ford assets for a total cash consideration of $3 billion. This is a key driver of bottom-line growth I think the market has yet to price in.

37035,2019-05-09 09:00:45,The real consequences of cryptocurrency market manipulation,"Accusations that the cryptocurrency market is being manipulated have long been thrown around. Market manipulation isn’t just an issue with the cryptocurrency market though. Traditional finance also suffers from market manipulation, but due to the liquidity of this market, it is more difficult and usually harder to spot. On top of this, the traditional financial markets are much more heavily regulated than what we see in the cryptocurrency market. While market manipulation has slowed in recent years in the cryptocurrency industry when compared to the wild early days, there is still clear evidence that it is apparent. So what are the issues with market manipulation, and who suffers the most from it? Evidence of market manipulation The most common form of market manipulation you might have heard of, especially in terms of cryptocurrencies, is the pump and dump scheme. The idea is simple. Whales (big bag holders) will accumulate coins of a small market cap cryptocurrency. They will then convince others to buy the cryptocurrency and the price will rise dramatically. The whales then dump their coins, causing a big drop in price. This scheme is more common with small market cap coins as they are easier to manipulate in terms of price. Pump and dump schemes were common during the earlier years of cryptocurrency. In more recent years, as the market has gained liquidity, these types of manipulations have become harder, but are still apparent. Shockingly, one cryptocurrency exchange has even encouraged pump and dump schemes. YoBit ran a few pump and dumps in late 2018, pumping coins 5,000% in the space of 30 minutes. Issues such as these are why so many are calling for regulation of the cryptocurrency industry. Pump and dump schemes are not unique to cryptocurrencies however. Infamously, Jordan Belfort ran many stock market pump and dump schemes, earning himself the moniker The Wolf of Wall Street and having a Hollywood film made dramatising his life. Story continues Research has shown that on average there are two pump and dump schemes run each day, with a trading volume of $7 million. Using artificial intelligence and machine learning though, researchers believe they have found a way to spot these schemes before they happen. During the bull run of 2017, many accusations were made that much of the price rise in Bitcoin was due to the printing of the stablecoin Tether inflating the market. These findings were never conclusively proven, although the accusations still exist to this day. A more subtle form of market manipulation is through the use of paid shills. So-called influencers in the cryptocurrency space can have large audiences who trust them and who are willing to invest in their suggestions. These can cause price spikes on certain cryptocurrencies by promising the world and then subsequently not delivering. John McAfee’s infamous ‘Coin of the Day’ during the bull run of 2017 is the clearest example of such manipulation, but there are still questions as to how much or whether he was paid to shill the projects. Winners and losers of market manipulation The winners of market manipulation via pump and dump schemes are those that initiate such scams. They usually start on Telegram groups and rope in newcomers to feed off. Unfortunately, the people who lose out from such market manipulation schemes are usually those who are most desperate to make large gains with minimal effort. They become attracted to such scams as an easy and guaranteed way to make money. The other loser from obvious market manipulation is the cryptocurrency industry itself. The lack of regulation combined with such clear and obvious manipulation lessens the trust both with traditional finance experts as well as the general public. Media coverage, particularly from mainstream outlets, can exacerbate these issues further and make cryptocurrencies an easy target for criticism. Issues such as the lack of regulation are then brought into the equation. So far, the cryptocurrency industry has performed poorly at self-policing these issues. Instead, they are met with a shrug of the shoulders as if they are commonplace. Conclusion Market manipulation occurs in banking and stock markets, so it is little wonder that the cryptocurrency space, which is still largely unregulated, suffers as well. There are very few winners but a lot of losers from this situation. Those that line their pockets are happy, but the knock-on effects reverberate throughout the cryptocurrency industry. Until market manipulation is reduced, along with many other troubling variables that continue to plague the industry, mainstream adoption, or even mainstream acceptance, will remain distant.

To see more such companies, go directly to5 Most Undervalued Blockchain Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.
Cryptocurrencies and crypto stocks started 2023 on a positive note. While many analysts argue that we are now seeing the end of the crypto winter, some say this is a bear market rally and the crypto bear market is far from over. Bear market or not, one thing everyone agrees with is that blockchain and decentralized finance will have a key role to play in financial transactions in the future. While many cryptocurrencies might be speculative in nature, blockchain is free from all such speculative impurities since it’s a technology that powers cryptocurrencies, networks and much more.
As a report bySeba Banknoted, the collapse of the crypto markets in 2022 was due to financial reasons, not technological.
“While 2022 is a crisis year for the cryptoverse, the root of the crisis is financial, not technological. This is a financial crisis because poorly designed cryptocurrencies collapsed and badly managed CeFi went under. This is not a technological crisis as blockchains continue to work smoothly. In the case of bitcoin, a block is added on average every 600 seconds, independently from price level and market stress. This crypto winter is the third since the invention of Bitcoin. The technology is battle tested and is solid. There is no reason to believe that this time is different and that bitcoin & co will not strengthen again.”
But decentralized finance space also got hit in 2022 as investors cut back on spending in the sector and funding dried. According to a research report published byThe Block Research, total value locked in DeFi contracted in 2022 to $42.1 billion from $166 billion in 2021. This shows a decline of about 75%. The report said that decentralized exchanges and lending platforms were the hottest of the sub-segments in DeFi in 2022. The biggest decline in the industry was felt when Terra ecosystem collapsed.
As you will see in this article, major banks, including Bank of America and JPMorgan, are investing heavily into blockchain technologies to allow users to solve key problems in the financial space.

Coming to the latest developments, cryptocurrencies are diving after regulators in the US seem to prepare for a crackdown against several digital coin companies. Earlier this month, crypto firm Paxos said it will stop issuing new Binance USD, or BUSD, stablecoins under the direction of New York state’s financial regulator.
The SEC also settled with crypto exchange Kraken over allegations of unregistered offering and sale.
Some analysts believe the latest crackdown effects can also spillover in the DeFi industry. According to aBloomberg report, Binance-sponsored BNB Chain, which has the most BUSD usage in DeFi, can be affected amid the latest developments. The report cited Andrew Thurman, a researcher at Nansen, a blockchain analytics platform, who said the following:
“The whole ecosystem will presumably have to pivot to a different stablecoin as its primary source of liquidity.”
Nonetheless, there are several blockchain companies that have long-term growth potential and can rebound strongly once the market gets more clarity on crypto and related technologies.

Speaking at an X Takeover event, Musk stated, ""I do think there's some merit in Bitcoin and maybe some of the other crypto,"" without specifying which cryptocurrencies he had in mind. He also expressed his affection for Dogecoin, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency featuring a Shiba Inu dog. ""I sort of have a soft spot for Dogecoin because I just like dogs and memes,"" he added, showcasing his playful approach to the crypto world.
Despite his personal interest, Musk emphasized that he does not actively promote cryptocurrencies. Addressing the misuse of his image in crypto scams, he stated, ""I'm not going to be promoting crypto—at most, in a joking way."" He further cautioned, ""If you see me pumping crypto, it's not me.""
The Tesla CEO's image has been exploited in various scams, from hacking his Twitter account to creating fake advertisements and deepfake videos, deceiving unsuspecting victims into parting with substantial amounts of cryptocurrency. At the X Takeover event, Musk advised users to be vigilant against scams, urging them to ""double check whether that is real"" when encountering crypto-related promotions.
Tesla, under Musk's leadership, continues to hold a significant amount of Bitcoin. Analysts have determined that the company's Bitcoin holdings remained stable in the last quarter of 2023, valued at approximately $387 million with over 9,720 BTC. This information, sourced from Bitcoin Treasuries, highlights Tesla's ongoing commitment to cryptocurrency as part of its corporate treasury.
Musk's stance on cryptocurrency has seen numerous shifts. In 2021, he briefly announced that Tesla would accept Bitcoin as payment for its vehicles, an initiative that was quickly retracted. Nonetheless, the company maintains its Bitcoin holdings. Additionally, Musk has been a vocal proponent of Dogecoin, even suggesting that Tesla might eventually accept it as a form of payment.",66456.75,0.0,66414.0,-0.06,66372.01,-0.12,66230.01,-0.34,66454.0

21524,2018-03-05 17:58:00,Weak Sales Growth Hits Middleby,"People need to eat, and by making the equipment that many people rely on in order to prepare meals,Middleby(NASDAQ: MIDD)can count on regular demand from a wide variety of customers. Yet the food equipment business is still cyclical, andover the past three years, Middleby has had to work hard to endure some difficult conditions that its buyers have struggled through for their own businesses.
Coming into its fourth-quarter financial report, Middleby investors were hoping that solid sales growth would produce modest gains on the bottom line. The company wasn't able to make its revenue rise as much as some had hoped, and fears about a slowdown that could push into the first half of 2018 also made investors nervous. Let's take a closer look at Middleby and what's ahead for the kitchen equipment specialist.
Image source: Middleby.
Middleby's fourth-quarter results were poor in investors' eyes. Revenue of $632.9 million climbed 6% from the year-ago quarter, although those following the stock had hoped to see closer to $645 million on the top line. But net income was down 7% to $75.2 million, and even after accounting for one-time items, adjusted earnings of $1.48 per share weren't quite as good as the $1.50-per-share consensus forecast among investors.
Tax reform was a net positive for Middleby on the bottom line. The company said that revaluing deferred taxes at the lower corporate income rate was only partially offset by the deemed repatriation tax in the U.S. shift to a territorial tax system. That helped to turn a $36.1 million tax liability in the year-ago quarter into a $14 million net benefit this year.
Organic sales figures, though, were downright ugly for Middleby during the quarter. Both acquisitions and foreign exchange impacts helped to boost Middleby's revenue figures, with purchased businesses helping to boost sales by 10%. That left organic sales down 5.7% for the quarter, pulling down the full-year figure to a 3.6% loss.
The only segment to show higher sales was commercial foodservice, and that came solely from multiple acquisitions. Segment organic revenue dropped 0.7% when you take out the impact of the purchases of Sveba Dahlen, QualServ, L2F, and Globe. Meanwhile, the food processing equipment group posted a 1.8% drop in segment revenue, with a huge organic sales drop of more than 13% when you take out the impacts from Burford, CVP Systems, and Scanico. The residential kitchen equipment group posted a 5% dip in segment revenue.
Continued internal weakness also persisted. Gross margin was down more than 2 percentage points to 37.9%, because the companies that Middleby has bought recently have lower margins than its legacy business does. Moreover, impairment charges of $58 million tied to Viking showed the damage that has been done to that brand after recalls that Middleby essentially inherited after acquiring the product line.
CEO Selim Bassoul pointed to anumber of factors that drove the poor results. In commercial foodservice, major restaurant chains remain under pressure as they look at other potential kitchen solutions to cut expenses. Residential kitchen sales are still suffering from fallout from the Viking recalls in past years, and food processing equipment saw what the CEO sees as temporary declines related to the timing of large projects.
Still, Middleby thinks things can get better. Bassoul said in the conference call following the report that positive trends are starting to emerge in the commercial foodservice business as 2018 begins, and people who follow the stock note that a large pipeline of orders in its legacy business combined with substantial new acquisitions should help power growth forward from a relatively weak 2017. That could make the coming year look explosively strong by comparison, especially if bets in the international business pan out.
Middleby investors weren't ready to be that patient, however, and thestock plunged 10% following the report. Until the company shows more concrete results from its efforts to improve itself, Middleby probably won't see the buy-in among shareholders that it wants.

Let’s delve a little deeper into the events that caused such market movements and are worth watching in September.
Harvey Hits Houston
August 2017 can be remembered in the United States as a month of Hurricane Harvey which wreaked havoc in Texas, causing the worst flood in years. Loss estimates for Harvey could reach $100 billion, according to an insurance analyst at Imperial Capital projects, as quoted on Bloomberg.
Refiners’ haven Texas saw their oil industry getting crippled thanks to Harvey, flood insurers turned soggy, home improvement retailers rejoiced on the need to re-arrange houses and the auto industry fell in a tight spot as auto dealerships closed down (read: Hurricane Harvey Puts These ETF Areas in Focus).
As refiners were badly hit, crude prices plunged and gasoline prices shot up.United States Gasoline FundUGA gained about 6.2% in the last five days (as of Aug 30, 2017). The difference in the price of crude oil and gasoline futures — the crack spread — shot up to benefitVanEck Vectors Oil Refiners ETF CRAK(read: 4 Sector ETFs Winning on Revenue Growth).

Benchmark Treasury Yield’s Biggest Monthly Drop in Over a Year
Tensions between President Donald Trump and North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un heightened thanks to nuclear activity by the latter. Second, U.S. stocks are guilty of overvaluation concerns.
To add to woes, two high-profile business advisory councils were dissolved in mid-August after two more CEOs resigned from the manufacturing council. Plus, the latest Fed minutes showed that policymakers are wary of weak inflation (read: Multi-Asset ETFs for Uncertain Markets).
All these kept Treasury yields lower in August. Yield on the 10-Year Benchmark U.S. Treasury declined to 2.12% on Aug 31, down 13 bps from the start of the month. This marked “the largest monthly drop in more than a year” in the 10-year Treasury yield.

Such confusions in the market pushed up volatility levels as evident from 6.1% returns delivered byiPath S&P 500 VIX ST Futures ETNVXX. This boosted the safe haven appeal of gold, leadingSPDR Gold Trust GLDto tack on 3% gains in the month (as of Aug 30, 2017) (read: 3 Reasons to Buy Gold ETFs Now).
Defense ETFs Soar
With geopolitical tensions rising and North Korea launching missiles, demand for arms from countries like South Korea and Japan are believed to be soaring. This has pushed up defense ETFs likeSPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF XAR.The fund added 3.4% in the month (as of Aug 30, 2017).
Stupendous Rally in Bitcoin
Bitcoin fired on all cylinders in August, having returned about over 71% in a month (as of Aug 30, 2017). The crypto-currency is in the limelight probably because of the fact that ""bitcoin isn't regulated by any government and has been used by consumers worldwide to shelter assets from inflation or political upheavals in their home countries."" Interestingly, investment firms VanEck and REX filed up bitcoin ETFs in August (read: Bitcoin ETFs: More Issuers Join the Race).
Biotech Bounces Back

19378,2019-03-07 09:00:51,What is the Ravencoin protocol?,"Want to make your own security token and trade worldwide with it? The Ravencoin protocol could well be the answer. Inspired by the truth-carrying ravens of Westeros in Game of Thrones, Ravencoin claims to “carry statements of truth about who owns what assets”. A platform dedicated to tokens The Ravencoin protocol , based on a fork of the Bitcoin code, gives users ultimate freedom when it comes to tokens. Issuers can determine all the characteristics of their tokens, from quantity limits and security types to collectible statuses. Its community can issue, track, and transfer their tokenised assets. These assets can include: Project shares such as royalties Virtual goods such as in-game items Physical and digital assets such as land deeds or gold Credit such as gift cards or airline miles Ravencoin is free and open source. All token transfers take place on the peer-to-peer blockchain, instantly and worldwide. A fairer world for mining The Ravencoin cryptocurrency (RVN) is issued fairly. The project directly addresses the historical centralisation of mining that occurs on Bitcoin’s blockchain . This centralisation is thought to be the result of Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware used by miners to increase efficiency and competition. To keep mining decentralised and the reward mechanism fair, Ravencoin randomises the order of 16 different hashing algorithms. This specially developed x16r algorithm keeps the playing field level between users and makes ASIC miners incredibly hard to develop. Instead, RVN is mined publicly and transparently using the Proof-of-Work mechanism. In the event that an ASIC miner is developed, Ravencoin will completely change the hash algorithms. This emphasis on decentralisation has always been part of the Raven ethos as the platform launched without an ICO. It is a project driven by community rather than competition. Coins are available to everyone – with nothing being held for developers or founders of the project. Story continues Ravencoin vs Bitcoin Although based on a fork of Bitcoin, Ravencoin looks to resolve some of the shortcomings of the original cryptocurrency. Ravencoin prioritises security, user control, privacy, and censorship resistance. This is achieved, in part, by standing apart from Bitcoin. Everything from its mining algorithm through to its future roadmap brings something to the table that isn’t being offered by Bitcoin. Some key differences offered by Ravencoin include: A block reward of 5,000 RVN in comparison to 50 BTC A total coin supply of 21 billion rather than 21 million Future additions of rewards, messaging, and voting Where to buy, sell, and store Ravencoin Some major exchanges such as Binance have added Ravencoin to their listings. Other exchanges you can use include CoinExchange, CryptoBridge, and Cryptopia. Ravencoin is still in its infancy, but as its popularity continues to grow, this list of exchanges may well expand. You can store your Ravencoin in desktop and mobile wallets. Remember that Ravencoin is open source, so these wallets are available on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms. For those looking for increased security, paper wallets are also available. The future of Ravencoin Although the platform only launched in January 2018, there is a clear roadmap in place for the future. This includes solving Anti-Money Laundering and Know-Your-Customer issues. Ravencoin also experienced a huge value hike in March 2019, giving support to the view that the future of cryptocurrency success could lie in tokenisation .

78597,2024-06-20 22:50:22,Nvidia company history & timeline: From GPU maker to AI leader,"Companies adapt to change or go out of business. Nvidia Corp.(NVDA)is no exception.
Founded as a graphics processing company, Nvidia has pivoted toward designing and building chips for accelerated computing that can process vast amounts of data quickly for generative AI (artificial intelligence).
Nvidia vaulted from a niche player in its early days to the forefront of the technology industry a few decades later. Itsmarket capitalizationin the trillions of dollars dwarfs many established companies, and as its name implies, Nvidia has become the envy of its rivals.

Nowadays, any company that’s associated with the development of AI uses Nvidia’s hardware and software, which the company calls “the AI factories of the future.” Generative AI, or AI that produces text, images, or video using vast amounts of data, has essentially become a new type of computing platform. Nvidia had a major part in the formation of OpenAi’s chatbot, ChatGPT — one of the best-known and most-used generative AI engines in existence.
Here’s the full story of how Nvidia grew from a small graphics processing company into the multitrillion-dollar tech and AI powerhouse it is today.
Like many well-known tech companies such as Apple(AAPL)and Hewlett-Packard(HPE), Nvidia traces its roots to Silicon Valley, and the company has its own lore.
Nvidia was founded by Jensen Huang and fellow engineers Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. The three discussed the company’s formation over a meal at a Denny’s restaurant — the same diner chain Huang once worked at as a teenager in Portland — near San Jose, California. Their goal was to design a chip that would enable realistic 3D graphics on personal computers.

The co-founders envisioned better graphics that could be powered by a specialized electronic circuit known as a graphics processing unit (GPU). While a semiconductor can handle an abundance of tasks, it would be burdened by the multitude of calculations and processes needed to render complex graphics. Thus, a GPU could be added to a slot in a personal computer via a card to handle those graphics. Their GPU came into the market in 1999.
By the 2000s, GPUs were in high demand among gamers for their ability to accelerate graphics and image processing. Nvidia forged partnerships with Sega, which developed games and had its own gaming console, and Silicon Graphics, which produced hardware and software for graphics.
Eventually, GPUs evolved for use in non-graphical applications and paved the way for accelerated computing. In 2006, Nvidia developed the CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) platform, which allowed GPUs to be used for non-graphical computing tasks, including AI and machine learning.
In the 2010s, Nvidia shifted toward developing hardware and software for next-level computing, which would be focused on AI. It bought some companies along the way to aid in its vision.
Nvidia started defining its GPU architectures (the underlying designs and technologies that define the capabilities and performance of its GPUs) in 2006 with the Tesla Architecture (each of its designs takes the name of a notable figure in technology, science, or mathematics).
It gained traction in the 2010s with further advancements and improvements with the Fermi Architecture in 2010, followed by the Kepler Architecture (2012), the Maxwell Architecture (2014), the Pascal Architecture (2016), and the Volta Architecture (2017).
With the Turing Architecture (2018), Nvidia focused on making enhancements with AI in mind, and others followed: Ampere Architecture (2020), Ada Lovelace Architecture (2022), Hopper Architecture (2022), and Grace Architecture (2023–2024).

In 2012, deep learning started to gain traction, and GPUs were being used in deep neural networks. These networks process complex patterns and relationships using vast amounts of data for tasks such as image and speech recognition and natural language processing.
Nvidia’s AI platform encompasses hardware and software that enables any organization to take advantage of developing AI tools for its own use. Its AI platform powers leading cloud services such as Amazon’s(AMZN)AWS, Alphabet’s(GOOGL)Google Cloud, and Microsoft’s(MSFT)Azure.
Nvidia’s bet on AI wasn’t a sure thing, but Huang was prepared to guide the company at the moment when the opportunity presented itself. As Alphabet and other companies started to delve into machine learning and developing the complex algorithms that would power generative AI, demand for Nvidia’s AI-focused products and services picked up.
Nvidia says that millions of developers create thousands of applications for accelerated computing, and tens of thousands of companies use its AI technologies.

Profit-taking is largely to blame, especially considering there were few macroeconomic triggers that could influence BTC's price, says a new report from digital asset investment firm CoinShares.
And that would suggest that meaningfully staying above thepsychologically significant threshold of $30,000could be a tough nut to crack for bulls. As of Monday morning, Bitcoin wassliding towards $27,000and down 9% from the last week, according to CoinGecko.
Overall, digital asset investment products saw total outflows of $30 million in the seven days through April 21—with CoinShares XBT, ProShares, and 3iQ the hardest-hit providers. The providers all manage exchange-traded products pegged to cryptocurrencies, an indirect way for institutional investors to get exposure to crypto markets without actually holding it.
But the devil's in the details. According to CoinShares head of research James Butterfill, there's one cryptocurrency that's bucking the trend in a big way.
Basking in the glow of the successful""Shapella""upgrade, Ethereum actually enjoyed inflows of $17 million last week—putting it far ahead of major altcoins, like Solana, Cardano, XRP, and Litecoin, which were mostly flat.
This indicates investors are feeling confident now that validators on Ethereum'sproof-of-stakenetwork can withdraw staked ETH if they so wish.
Butterfill also revealed that inflows into ETH-based funds came solely from Europe, which is fresh from approving much-welcomed,landmark legislationon cryptocurrencies.
All of this comes as regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. casts a long shadow over American crypto firms—with theSEC's crackdownpotentially prompting investors to sit on the sidelines.
There was also a clear continental divide when it came to Bitcoin.
""Regionally, the profit-taking was almost solely from North America, which saw outflows totaling $54 million,"" Butterfill wrote. ""This was offset by the continued optimistic sentiment in Germany which saw inflows totalling $29 million.""
That optimism in Germany has undoubtedly been driven by the country'sfriendly tax regime, which states that cryptocurrency offloaded after 12 months isn't subject to capital gains.",27319.54,-0.03,27326.1,-0.01,27390.16,0.23,27452.87,0.46,27328.06

A sharp pickup in demand for riskier assets supported a 2.28% NASDAQ rally fueled by hints from the Fed of a less aggressive rate path trajectory. The total crypto market cap rose by $35 billion to record the fifth increase in six sessions. It was a bullish Thursday session for the crypto top ten. Bitcoin ( BTC ) led the way, with SOL and ETH close behind. Investors brushed aside fears of a global economic recession, with the FOMC meeting minutes from Wednesday driving demand for riskier assets. The FOMC meeting minutes highlighted the risk of rate hikes having a ‘larger-than-expected effect on economic growth.’ Prior to the minutes, the markets had priced in a 75 basis point rate hike for July. However, the minutes revealed that participants judged a 50 or 75 basis point increase as appropriate. Total Market Cap – NASDAQ – 080722 5 Min Chart At the time of writing, the NASDAQ 100 Mini was down 32.5 points. The Total Crypto Market Cap Jumps on Fed Minutes A bearish start to the session saw the crypto market cap fall to a low of $889 billion before jumping to a high of $945 billion. NASDAQ 100 support was the key to the move back toward $1,000 billion levels. While bullish on the day, crypto market headwinds linger. The threat of a global economic recession remains real, as does a likely shift in the crypto regulatory landscape. From a monetary policy perspective, while Fed concern over the impact of policy on economic growth prospects delivered relief, the Fed has stated its commitment to bringing inflation to target at any cost. The Crypto Market Movers and Shakers from the Top Ten and Beyond BTC rallied by 5.19% to lead the way, with SOL (+3.88%) and ETH (+4.35%) close behind. ADA (+3.46%), BNB (+1.26%), DOGE (+3.13%), and XRP (+3.13%) also found strong support. From the CoinMarketCap top 100, Storj ( STORJ ), Aave ( AAVE ), and Internet Computer ( ICP ) led the way. STORJ rallied by 15%, with AAVA and ICP gaining 13% and 11%, respectively. Story continues Maker ( MKR ) and KuCoin Token ( KCS ) were among a handful of cryptos to buck the trend. MKR fell by 0.53%, with KCS falling by 0.60%. Total Crypto Liquidations Reflect Improving Market Conditions Despite the bullish session, 24-hour liquidations rose through the Thursday session.

52078,2022-03-03 10:55:41,Latest Bitcoin price and analysis (BTC to USD),"Bitcoin is currently at a crucial point of resistance following an impressive start to the month that saw it surge to the $45,000 level. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is trading at $43,300, an important level of support in itself. If it can rally up towards $45,000 before stock markets close on Friday evening, it would pave the way for a breakout and continuation to the upside over the coming weeks. Eventual targets remain at $53,000 and $56,000 – however Bitcoin would need to avoid placing itself in a bull trap scenario. Bitcoin BTCUSD chart by TradingView If volume, and subsequently price action, begins to subside this month with a slump back below $41,000 – it would signal that this move was a run to liquidate short positions before it heads lower. On higher time frames Bitcoin remains in a downtrend from $69,000, a swift break of $53,000 is the only thing that would confirm a bullish reversal. In the short term Bitcoin needs to hold $43,000 and begin to establish a stronger level of support, although it’s worth noting that price action is currently being driven to the crisis in Ukraine and a potential hike of interest rates by the Federal Reserve.

39016,2018-07-02 20:25:00,"Mini-Kmarts Can't Save Sears, and Vice Versa","Store-in-store concepts are not new. Retailers use them to try to generate a halo effect from the opening of a popular brand's boutique inside their stores. The hope is that the appeal of both brands can be improved by the synergies of joining forces.
Best BuyallowedMicrosoftandSamsungto open up mini-stores to attract more customers;J.C. Penneyincreased customer traffic after opening Sephora-branded beauty care shops inside its department stores; andMacy'sis going one better by combining store-in-store boutiques with the latest hot retail trend, pop-up stores, inside several of its locations.
But would people shop at a Sears store because it had a mini-Kmart inside, or go to a Kmart because there was a Sears boutique?Sears Holdings(NASDAQ: SHLD)thinks they will.
Image source: Sears Holdings.
In yet another effort to reverse falling sales, Sears is opening a diminutive version of Kmart in a Brooklyn location, while also planning to test small-format Sears stores inside some Kmart locations. The two brands have been together for over a decade, but it wasn't until the retailer was near death's door that it considered this store-in-store concept.
On the surface, it seems to be just as bad an idea as chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert's original concept of merging two failing retailers into one large operation. Rarely does that create a winning combination, and Sears Holdings is a prime example of that.
Still, there could be some merit to the store-in-store plan. Although Kmart sells a number of the same types of products as Sears, the mini-Kmart will feature items you can't get at Sears, like cleaning supplies, pet supplies, groceries, and more.
Similarly, the mini-Sears shops inside Kmart will sell appliances. While Kmart does offer some appliances, they are only at the introductory end of the price scale; the Sears store-in-store boutiques will feature higher-end goods,according to CNBC.
The idea behind adding the 10,000-square-foot Kmart store-in-store is to make the Brooklyn Sears location a one-stop shop for customers. Instead of having to go to Kmart to get your groceries and then head over to Sears to buy other merchandise, you can do it all in one trip.
The store-in-store concept sounds like something that should have been tried a long time ago, but not many people expect it to change Sears' fortunes. It does suggest that Lampert still isn't giving up on Sears as a retail concept -- though maybe he should. Sears' sales have been plummeting quarter after quarter, causing it to burn through cash and forcing Lampert to continuously infuse it with short-term loans. Like many of his other experiments, this one is too little, too late.
Lampert was forced to sellthe Craftsman tool brandtoStanley Black & Deckerlast year to raise cash to stabilize its balance sheet. However, because the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation had a lien on the asset, he needed its permission to make the sale and agreed to contribute a portion of the proceeds to Sears Holdings' pension plan. Lampert arranged to allow Sears to continue manufacturing Craftsman tools for 15 years and to receive a percentage of what Stanley makes from them, which will be used to fund Sears' pension obligation. Although Sears is ultimately competing against itself, it did make the best of a bad situation.
Lampert also finally allowed Sears' Kenmore and DieHard products to besold in third-party outlets, including onAmazon.com. Sears also became thethe first nationwide tire installerfor tires purchased on Amazon, where it is trading on the residual popularity of the DieHard brand.
But customers continue to flee the retailer, with comparable-store sales down 12% in the latest quarter as revenue plunged 31% year over year. Much of that revenue decline is the result of closing hundreds of stores. If this latest idea is successful, we'll likely see even more stores close as the concepts are combined.
Yet this is an experiment that probably should have been tried at the start of the merger, not when the retailer is at the end of its life cycle. Having joined Sears and Kmart together, Lampert should have closed one and combined it with the other under one banner.
Yet with Sears and Kmart rapidly spiraling down the drain and customers fleeing both chains, this half-measure of opening boutiques inside each other's stores will likely fail like Lampert's other attempts at a turnaround. It is proof that sometimes late is no better than never.

43833,2022-01-04 18:26:56,"Reddit Recap: Meme Stocks, Dogecoin, Bitcoin and the Growth of Crypto in 2022","Social media platform Reddit, which was on a roll in 2021, recently released ayear-end“Reddit Recap.” The recap covers some surprises concerning the platform, including the fact that redditors expressed moreinvestmentinterest in Dogecoin than inBitcoin.
See:Reddit Confidentially Files for IPO – Could it Become a Meme Stock?Find:Tesla Memes are Raging on Reddit’s WallStreetBets After the Stock Dropped 5% Monday
Reddit was at the center of this year’s meme stock volatility saga — in part due to very active and opinionated retail traders on r/WallStreetBets subreddit — and also, in December, announced it had confidentially submitted paperwork to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an Initial Public Offering (IPO).
“This past year, Reddit became the place where people felt empowered and inspired to share their opinions, experiences, and stories and connect with one another to take action and positively impact their communities,” Reddit said in a blog post.
It comes as no surprise that breaking down the most viewed topics of 2021, crypto is the number one theme, preceding gaming.
“In 2021, there were a lot of conversations on Reddit, but none more prominent than cryptocurrency. For more than 10 years, Reddit has been home to over 500 cryptocurrency communities. As more redditors participate in conversation, whether it be for information, help, or to share major successes, Reddit continues to be the hub for cryptocurrency enthusiasts,” the recap read.
Notably, Dogecoin garnered more interest than Bitcoin on Reddit in 2021: the top-five most-viewed crypto communities in 2021 were r/dogecoin, r/superstonk, r/cryptocurrency, r/amcstock, and r/bitcoin.
In addition, the blog post notes that r/superstonk’s subscriber growth increased the most among Reddit’s crypto communities, with a 917K% increase year-over-year. There had been 6.6 million mentions of “crypto” across the platform in 2021, as of the posting of the recap.
In terms of most-upvoted posts among crypto communities, Dogecoin takes the No. 1 spot again, with a post titled “Who’s still holding $DOGE?” having 80,300 upvotes.

This was followed by posts titled “All the confirmation bias I need, right here in one tweet,” from r/superstonk and “You hear about the kid who put in $500 into a memecoin and made 100k, but you don’t hear about the hundreds who put $1000 and are left with $0.1,” from r/cryptocurrency.
Other topics of interest included AMC and Tesla, with the posts “AMC YOU IN JAIL, CHEATERS,” and “Tesla buys $1.5b in Bitcoin and is looking to accept the crypto as a form of payment in the near future,” rounding up the list of most popular threads.
In addition to the planned IPO, Reddit said it continued its global expansion by announcing new offices in Canada, Australia, and Germany, reaching new redditors around the globe.
“The number of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined. The initial public offering is expected to occur after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions,” Reddit said. “We are in a quiet period, and for regulatory reasons, we cannot say anything further.”

Peter Cohan, a senior lecturer at Babson College and author of “Goliath Strikes Back,” told GOBankingRates at the time that since it is a confidential filing, it’s hard to know whether the company is growing fast or making money.
“At the same time, I could see it becoming a meme stock since it hosts WallStreetBets which is the ultimate meme incubator,” Cohan added.
Reddit also noted in its 2021 recap that it aired its “first-ever, 5-second Super Bowl ad (or as we call it, Superb Owl). We shipped new features — Reddit Talk, Predictions, and CryptoSnoos — that gave redditors more ways to connect and engage with each other.”

Reddit made headlines earlier this year as retail traders on r/WallStreetBets, who were intent on taking down hedge fund short-sellers by buying shares of heavily shorted stocks, sent said stocks — includingGameStop, AMC Entertainment and Bed Bath & Beyond — soaring… and then crashing. In turn, the market volatility brought the attention, and sometimes ire, of regulators.

The world's largest bitcoin (BTC) spot exchange-traded fund lost half of its assets under management last Friday, which might have exacerbated bitcoin’s crash on Saturday.
The Purpose Bitcoin ETF saw an outflow of 24,510 bitcoins on Friday, the most severe redemption in a single day since the fund made its debut on the Canadian Stock Exchange in April 2021, according to the Norway-basedArcane Research.
The outflows mean that the fund had to sell about $500 million in BTC at Friday’s price, adding to the selling pressure in an already shaky crypto market, Arcane wrote in a report.
“The enormous outflows are likely caused by a forced seller in a huge liquidation,” Arcane analyst Vetle Lunde wrote. “The forced selling of the 24,000 BTC could have triggered BTC’s move down towards $17,600 this weekend.”
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $20,000 on Saturday, tumbling to as low as $17,678. Traders were rattled by fears of crypto industry insolvencies, as crypto lenderCelsius Networkhalted client withdrawals, BlockFisought additional financingandcrypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capitalconfirmed itsuffered heavy losses.
The weekend's price action also marked thefirst timethat the largest cryptocurrency had fallen below its previous cycle’s all-time high, notched in December 2017, of $19,783.
Bitcoin ETFstrack the value of bitcoin and provide a way to invest in the largest cryptocurrency without dealing directly with crypto; they can be bought, sold and traded on traditional stock market exchanges instead of on cryptocurrency trading platforms. ETFs actively add and sell bitcoin to match investors investing in and redeeming from the fund.
The Purpose Bitcoin ETF was by far the largest bitcoin-focused exchange-traded product, managing almost 48,000 bitcoins before Friday’s redemptions. Now, the fund holds only about 23,300 BTC.
Another bitcoin-focused fund, the 3iQ CoinShares Bitcoin ETF, suffered large outflows last month, selling 7,401 BTC of its holdings.
As a result of last week’s outflows, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF lost its top spot to the New York Stock Exchange-listed ProShares Bitcoin Strategy (BITO) ETF, which holds bitcoin futures instead of spot bitcoin.
BITO saw its second-largest net inflows last week since itslaunchlast October, leading the fund's bitcoin exposure to grow by the equivalent of 4,115 BTC.Datashows that the fund manages $668 million in assets, equating to about 31,500 BTC.
The contrast suggests that “at least some U.S. investors are eyeballing the current sell-off in BTC as an attractive point of entry, taking advantage of forced sellers,” for a short-term relief rally, Lunde wrote in the Arcane Research report.
Overall, crypto funds that manage bitcoin raked in $28 million in inflows last week, seemingly benefitting from the weak prices, crypto fund provider CoinSharesreportedMonday.
“Opinion amongst investors is extremely polarized, with some seeing this as a great buying opportunity, while others are spooked, liquidating positions,” James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, told CoinDesk in an email. “Fund flows are likely to remain mixed.”",20912.31,0.11,20927.65,0.18,20852.31,-0.18,20868.41,-0.1,20890.28
41116,2018-07-24 05:30:23,"Potential BOJ Adjustment to Monetary Policy Fueling Volatility in Debt, Forex Markets","The major Asian stock indexes are moving higher early Tuesday, but traders are expressing concerns over rising bond yields and the falling Chinese Yuan.
At 0342, theJapanese Nikkeiis trading 22534.03, up 137.04 or +0.61%. The South Korean Kospi Index is at 2277.54, up 8.23 or +0.36%. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 Index is moving up 40.50, or +0.65% at 6267.00 and China’s Shanghai Index is trading higher by 44.39, up 1.55% at 2903.93.
Most of the indexes reversed losses from Monday on the back of a mixed performance onWall Street. The highlight of the session was the jump inGoogleparent Alphabet after the company reported expectations-topping second-quarter earnings and revenue on Monday.
Ahead of Tuesday’s session, more than 17 percent ofS&P 500companies have reported earnings for the previous quarter, with 82 percent of those topping expectations, according to FactSet.
U.S. Treasury yields rose on Monday in reaction to a major swing in Japanese interest rates. The yield on the Japanese 10-year note jumped more than 4 basis points Monday to its highest level since February following reports that the Bank of Japan could adjust its monetary policy to make the program more sustainable.
The yield on the U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note tracked the move in Japanese yields, rising 7 basis points to 2.96 percent, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond moved up to 3.094 percent.
The price action in both the Japanese and U.S. debt markets was fueled by sources who told Reuters that the BOJ is holding preliminary talks on making changes to its interest-rate targeting and stock-buying techniques.
Although BOJ officials made it clear that this wasn’t a tightening move, the debt markets did not respond that way.
TheU.S. Dollaris trading flat to lower against a basket of currencies early Tuesday, following a solid technical reversal bottom the previous session.
The Greenback traded sharply lower against theJapanese Yenearly in the session on Monday as Japanese exporters aggressively bought the currency. However, a surge in U.S. Treasury yields to a five-week high made the U.S. Dollar a more attractive investment, leading to the potentially bullish reversal bottom in the USD/JPY.
Some of the early rally by the Yen was driven by Japanese exporters who converted their foreign earnings into the local currency. This was a typical end of the month move. However, the bulk of the rally was ignited by a report that the Bank of Japan was debating moves to scale back its massive monetary stimulus.

917,2017-05-12 20:01:11,How to Protect Yourself as Ransomware Attack Spreads Around the Globe,"Consumer Reports has no relationship with any advertisers on this website. Hospitals and other healthcare providers across England were forced to cancel countless appointments and divert ambulances on Friday after a massive ransomware attack crippled their computer systems. In the hours that followed, the crisis spread to facilities in at dozens of other countries, according to news reports. FedEx was one of the big corporations affected by the attack, saying that ""like many other companies, FedEx is experiencing interference with some of our Windows-based systems caused by malware. We are implementing remediation steps as quickly as possible. We regret any inconvenience to our customers.” Although this latest attack was massive in scope, ransomware threats often strike the personal computers of individual consumers, too. Here’s what you need to know and how to protect yourself. What Is Ransomware? Ransomware is a form of malware designed to steal money from individuals, businesses and other organizations by holding their data hostage. Imagine coming home to find a big padlock on your front door and a criminal standing next to it, demanding money to let you in. That's ransomware. Only instead of being locked out of your house, you're locked out of all your personal files. The next time you log on, your computer displays a ransom note saying your data has been encrypted, with instructions on how to pay to unlock it. Can Hackers Really Make Money Doing This? Oh, yes. Ransomware is big business. Ransoms can range from a few hundred to thousands of dollars and are usually paid in the ""virtual"" currency Bitcoin, which is nearly impossible to trace. In some cases, the longer you wait to pay, the higher the ransom becomes. According to cybersecurity firm Symantec's Internet Security Threat Report released in April, the number of new versions of ransomware uncovered during 2016 more than tripled to 101, while the number of ransomware infections the company spotted jumped 36 percent. Verizon's recently released 2017 Data Breach Investigations Report notes that ransomware accounted for 72 percent of the malware incidents involving the heathcare industry last year. Story continues Why Is This Particular Ransomware Attack Significant? Friday's attack affected at least 25 of the UK's National Health Service's hospitals and other organizations. But NHS says it was not the specific target of the attack. It does not appear that patient information was accessed, according to the organization, but its investigation into the matter is still in the early stages. Barts Health, which manages a handful of major hospitals in London and elsewhere, also confirmed it was experiencing a ""major IT disruption."" The malware arrived in encrypted files distributed by email. Once a computer was infected, the user received a note demanding $300 in bitcoin to restore access to patient information and other data on the device. British Prime Minister Theresa May called it an ""international attack"" affecting a ""number of countries and organizations."" CNN put the figure at 74 countries . Has This Ever Happened in the U.S.? Yes. One of the best known examples involved L.A.'s Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, which in February 2016 said it paid a ransom of $17,000 to get its computer systems unlocked. Because of the large amount of personal information collected about patients, hospitals and other healthcare providers are prime ransonware targets. If a doctor can't access information about a patient's medications and pre-exisiting conditions, it's virtually impossible to provide treatment, forcing the doctor and patient to reschedule appointments. And that can result in millions of dollars in lost productivity. So, even though medical computer systems are routinely backed up, and nearly all that data can be recovered and restored, hospitals often pay the ransom in an effort to speed things up and minimize financial losses. How Does Your Device Get Infected? Whether they involve a computer nework run by a business or hospital, or just an average person's personal PC, most ransomware infections happen when a user is lured by a bogus “phishing” email to a site that infects his or her computer, or by clicking on an attached file that secretly installs it. How can you avoid having your data taken hostage? You avoid ransomware the same way you avoid any malware infection: By being careful. While that's not always easy, there are things you can do to steer clear of problems. Don’t casually click a link inside an email; instead, type the web address directly into your browser. Never open an attachment unless you were expecting to receive it and you're certain of what it is. Don't spend time in the disreputable corners of the internet that specialize in risqué content or pirated movies; you can get infected simply by visiting a dodgy site. Never install software just because a web site tells you to do it. And always keep a backup copy of all your personal files on a separate drive or with a ""cloud""-based backup service. That way, if the worst happens, you'll always have access to your most important data.

However, the roller-coaster ride in September reflects a particularly troublesome time for Ethereum and is causing concern for investors and developers.
High transaction fees and slow network speed continue to be a problem. Despite the London upgrade from August, it has had little impact on volatility of transaction fees.
In the meantime, rival blockchains deemed “ethereum killers” are exploiting ethereum’s weaknesses.
Nonetheless, Ethereum, which is the building block for all sorts of crypto projects, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), smart contracts, and decentralized finance (DeFi), faces some major challenges to fend off the competition.
As a result, companies are looking into platforms like Cardano, which is used to build dApps, and Solana, which has seen a nearly 4,800% growth since September 2020. Due to its cheaper and faster price and faster usage than ethereum, Solana is gaining traction in the NFT and DeFi eco-systems.
A Solana website states the company processes 50,000 transactions per second at a cost of $ 0.00025 per transaction. The transaction speed on Ethereum is limited to about 13 transactions per second, and the fees are substantially higher than on Solana.
There is a flow of institutional funds. Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital led a $ 314 million token sale for Solana.
As investors diversify away from ethereum, alternative blockchains like Tezos, Solana, and Cardano are rallying.
The blockchain isn’t immune to bugs either. Solana was affected by a denial-of-service attack last month, which was caused by bots flooding transactions.
There are several so-called ethereum killers, including Matic and Polygon, both complementary and innovative technologies, and Cardano, which is well known for its security.

In December of 2020, Elon Musktweeted this simple statement, alluding to the Shiba Inu-themed digital coin, which started as a joke and which, as of closing on the day of Musk's tweet, was worth all of 0.4569 cents. It wasn't even the first time Musk had tweeted about Dogecoin. In July, he tweeted this photo:
Despite support from one of the biggest business names in the world,Dogecoin failed to hit even 1 cent in 2020. That changed early on in 2021, as the crypto doubled in value from January 1 to January 2, reaching a value of 1.1427 cents at closing. However, over the past couple of weeks, the cryptocurrency has been swept up in the deluge of investments inspired by Reddit's WallStreetBets and the crypto-basedSatoshiStreetBets, named after Satoshi Nakamoto, the presumed pseudonym of the bitcoin developer(s).
The crypto spiked from 0.7432 cents on January 27 to 5.1793 cents on January 29, before falling back to 3.9943 cents as of the time of this writing. Even that lower number represents a 437% growth in just a week, as more and more investors pour in and urge one another to ""hold the line"" and take Dogecoin ""to the moon."" Of course, no one has been more thrilled about Dogecoin's rise than the man who saidway back in April of 2019, ""Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool.""
However,Mike Winters atLifehackernotesthat there's a significant difference between investing in Dogecoin and the short squeeze related to stocks like GameStop and AMC. The latter, he says, were ""an opportunity to stick it to Wall Street while also making some money on the side. It actuallymakes sense as a trade, albeit a risky one.""
Dogecoin investment is different, in his opinion. He claims enthusiasts are simply bolstering the crypto's value for fun, hoping to hold their positions until it reaches Reddit's goal of $1. ""In fact,"" Winters writes, ""there’s no particular reason why Dogecoin would be worth buying, aside from the fact that it’s basically Bitcoin named after a meme.""
If Musk has his way, though, maybe memes will be enough. He's previously told news outlets that the most entertaining outcome would be if Dogecoin became the currency of earth in the future,explaining that while it may have started as a joke, ""Fate loves irony.""",33352.54,0.05,33396.17,0.18,33496.85,0.48,33494.27,0.47,33336.43

Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:
Market moves:Bitcoin moved above $47,000 a day before a Fed decision on combating inflation.
Technician’s take:Bitcoin’s tight price range could persist into the Asia trading day.
Catch the latest episodesofCoinDesk TVfor insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.
Bitcoin (BTC): $48,304 +2.8%
Ether (ETH): $3,843 +1.1%
S&P 500: $4,634 -0.7%
Dow Jones Industrial Average: $35,544 -0.3%
Nasdaq: $15,237 -1.14%
Gold: $1,771 -0.8%
Bitcoin recovered some losses from Monday, trading above $48,000 on Tuesday. But the optimism may be short-lived as trading volume remained low.
Data compiled by CoinDesk shows that bitcoin’s trading volume across major centralized exchanges on Tuesday was down from a day ago, reflecting a conservative view among traders.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to release its decision on Wednesday on whether it will move faster to wind down its bond purchases and signal ifit will start raising interest ratesnext year. The stock marketextended its losseson Monday as investors were closely monitoring the Fed’s upcoming decision.
“It is a bit of a daunting time right now,” Leah Wald, CEO of crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments, said in an interview with CoinDesk. Bitcoin “is still down 30% from its all-time high but we are definitely seeing strong resistance at the $48,000 and the $50,000 level.”
Ether also moved up slightly, but was still well below $4,000 at the time of publication. Dogecoin, meanwhile, remains the winning alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) of the day after Tesla CEO Elon Musksaidthe electric-car maker would accept DOGE as payment for its merchandise.
“I think there are a lot of opportunities in the market from other alternative currencies,” Wald said, pointing out ether’s weaker correlation to the traditional markets compared with bitcoin. “Ether is down 12% in the last week alone, which is very daunting, but at the same time there are a lot of reasons to expect that ether could potentially stage a recovery much sooner than bitcoin.”
Bitcoin Holds Short-Term Support at $46K; Resistance at $50K
Bitcoin (BTC) held steady around the $46,000support levelas oversold signals appeared on the charts. This means short-term buyers could remain active into the Asia trading day, although upside appears to be limited toward $50,000.
The tight trading range over the past two weeks coincided with slowing price momentum. Typically, trading volume declines when prices move sideways until a decisive breakout or breakdown is realized.
On the daily price chart, initial signs of downsideexhaustionhave appeared for the first time since July, which preceded a price recovery. Still, thesesignalsare not yet confirmed, especially because multiple oversold readings have not resulted in a meaningful price bounce over the past two weeks.
For now, the intermediate-term uptrend remains weak given the downward sloping 100-period moving average on the four-hour price chart. There is also strong resistance ahead, which could keep sellers in control.

Bitcoin (BTC) climbed for a third consecutive day, erasing this week’s early losses.
The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose 1.5% over the past 24 hours and was recently trading at about $21,000.
Some analysts are still wary of bitcoin’s surge amid a market that’s averse to risk, with inflationhitting a 40-year highon Wednesday and the troubled crypto lender Celsius Networkfiling for bankruptcyon Wednesday.
Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at Oanda, wrote that bitcoin’s recent resilience doesn’t necessarily mean a further recovery.
“The near-term outlook is still a concern given the broader risk environment and reports of bankruptcies in the industry,” Erlam wrote. “If anything, the latter could be a bigger concern if [bitcoin] does eventually break lower.”
The U.S. dollar index (DXY), a measure of the greenback relative to a basket of foreign currencies, is approaching highs unseen since 2002, Glassnode wrote in a newsletter.
The rise is driven by either a strengthening demand for USD-denominated fixed-income securities as the U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates or the depreciation of foreign currencies such as the euro, which recently dropped to a20-year lowof $1.0002 against the dollar.
The DXY has a predominantly negative correlation with bitcoin prices, and so further index increases could spell price declines for the cryptocurrency.
Most altcoins were in the green, with QNT leading the charts, up 13% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) was up 4.6%.

Bitcoin mining-rig prices slumped to nearly two-year lows as Celsius Miningfiled for bankruptcyon Wednesday alongside its parent company, Celsius Network.
The mining unit hadfiled a confidentialS-1 draft registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March to take the company public and said last year that it had invested$500 millionin its North America bitcoin mining operations.
Now, Celsius Mining is selling its rigs at a heavily discounted rate per terahash (TH).
“A person familiar with the situation told CoinDesk that Celsius Mining auctioned off thousands of its newly purchased mining rigs in June, with the first batch of 6,000 selling for $28/TH and a second group of 5,000 changing hands at $22/TH,” Aoyon Ashrafreported.
According to Luxor Mining’s hashrate indexdata, mining rigs were trading at around $50-$60/TH in June, double Celsius’ auction price.
A Glassnodereportlast month showed bitcoin miners’ total revenue had fallen 57% since the cryptocurrency’s all-time high while network difficulty had risen by 132%.
“This substantial jump in difficulty suggests that existing miners have expanded their operations, and new miners have joined the network despite a massive income reduction. As such it is likely that recent capital expenses on mining hardware and facilities could add continued pressure to miners’ balance sheets,” Glassnode wrote.

40388,2018-07-15 14:44:00,Why Intel's Move Into Discrete Graphics Cards Is a Waste of Time,"It will be an understatement to say thatIntel(NASDAQ: INTC)is in a state of disarray. Itscore markets are being attackedfrom several angles, its latest chip architecturehas been delayed(yet again), and the company has been left rudderless after theresignation of Brian Krzanich. But there's still a lot that could go wrong for Intel in addition to all of these problems.
The company recently revealed that it plans to launch itsfirst discrete graphics card by 2020. But even if Intel hits the promised timeline and actually manages to get a discrete GPU (graphics processing unit) on the market, I believe that it won't be able to make a big dent in this space. Its foray into discrete GPUs could, at best, turn out to be an exercise in futility.
Image Source: Intel.
Graphics card specialistsNVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA)andAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD)have been plying their trade in the GPU market for a very long time now. Both of these companies have poured research and development (R&D) dollars into their GPU architectures and are currently preparing for another generational leap.
For instance,NVIDIA's Turing GPUsare expected to succeed the existing Pascal architecture this year. Now, there's a lot of speculation about the process node on which the Turing architecture will be based. The general consensus among industry watchers suggests that it could probably be based on a 12-nanometer process node as compared to the current generation's 16 nm and 14 nm nodes.
A smaller process node allows the chipmaker to pack more processing power into a smaller footprint, leading to lower production costs and more power efficiency. Now, the jump to 12 nm won't be a huge generational leap over the current architecture, but it sets NVIDIA up to eventually move to a more efficient 7 nm process node fromTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
However, there are rumors that suggest NVIDIA is skipping the 12 nm process altogether and moving to 7 nm. But even if NVIDIA sticks to 12 nm first, we can assume that the graphics specialist will be able to roll out cards based on the more efficient 7 nm manufacturing platform by 2020. This is because NVIDIA usually releases new products every two years. Meanwhile, AMD recently showcased a 7 nm Vega GPU for use in servers and powerful workstations.
AMD will eventually bring this architecture to the consumer GPU market as well sometime next year. Intel, however, is probably waiting for its 10 nm process node to materialize so that it can compete against these upcoming chips. But the problem is that Intel hasrun into consistent delayswith this technology.
Provided Intel manages to hit its timeline and launches 10 nm parts by 2020, it still won't be offering anything new over what NVIDIA and AMD would be at that time. This will make it difficult for Intel to score customers for its discrete GPUs given the dominance that its rivals have already established in this space.
NVIDIA currently commands nearly two-thirds of the GPU market, as per Jon Peddie Research. It won't be losing its stronghold anytime soon thanks to its solid presence in both emerging and developed markets.
NVIDIA's emerging market base has increased at a very impressive annual pace of 40% over the past five years, while developed markets have also clocked an envious 28% growth rate. This has helped the company establish a solid installed base of users who will likely upgrade to its subsequent GPU generations thanks to technology advancementssuch as ray tracing.
In fact, NVIDIA claims that just 30% of its installed base is currently on the latest Pascal platform, while the remaining uses older-generation GPUs. So the company has a big opportunity to sell more GPUs as its installed base upgrades to new platforms that come out in the next couple of years. Given that an average GPU is expected to provide service inside a PC for an average of three years, NVIDIA looks all set to lap up most of the addressable market as it launches its more advanced GPU technology before Intel does.
It will be extremely difficult for Intel to crack the dominance of its rivals in the discrete GPU market given the massive technology and time lead that they enjoy. The company is better off focusing on other areas such as field-programmable gate arrays and server chips, two markets where it has a realistic chance of making it big butfaces severe competitionfrom the likes ofXilinxand AMD.
In all, Intel could be making a big mistake by turning its attention toward a market that's already notoriously competitive, as this could cause it to lose sight of the more important opportunities that it's sitting on.

94439,2024-09-24 14:13:50,Want Cryptocurrency Exposure? Here Are 2 Bitcoin ETFs You Can Buy Right Now,"When it comes to investing inBitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC)and other cryptocurrencies, there are two main ways to go. You can buy the cryptocurrencies themselves with the hope they go up in value over time, or you can invest in businesses that are involved in the crypto economy or that could benefit from it. With that in mind, here are twoexchange-traded funds (ETFs)that can give your portfolio exposure toBitcoinand related companies without requiring you to buy the digital currency on an exchange or select individual Bitcoin-related stocks.
Several different ETFs own Bitcoin, but theiShares Bitcoin Trust(NASDAQ: IBIT)is by far the largest, with more than $22 billion in assets. Virtually 100% of the fund's assets are in the form of Bitcoin, andCoinbase(NASDAQ: COIN)is the ETF's custodian.
The fund aims to track the price of Bitcoin over time, net of fees. It has a 0.25% expense ratio, which is certainly on the lower end for crypto ETFs and is reasonable in light of the operational costs and other challenges and inconveniences of owning directly.
Not only is owning a Bitcoin ETF like the iShares Bitcoin Trust easier than buying and selling the cryptocurrency on an exchange, but it can also reduce other complications, including tax-related ones. Buying and selling Bitcoin itself can create significant tax implications, especially if you use it to make or receive a payment. The tax implications of this ETF can be far more straightforward.
Another way to invest in Bitcoin is to buy an ETF that has lots of exposure to Bitcoin-adjacent businesses, such as cryptocurrency exchanges and financial technology companies. One that looks especially interesting is theArk Fintech Innovation ETF(NYSEMKT: ARKF), an actively managed fund operated by Cathie Wood's Ark Invest.
To be sure, this isn't a pure cryptocurrency play. The fund invests in other areas of financial technology innovation, such as digital wallet providers and e-commerce businesses. Its largest holding,Shopify(NYSE: SHOP), has little connection with cryptocurrency.
But the fund does have a lot of exposure to crypto and related businesses. Crypto exchange Coinbase is the fund's second-largest holding, andBlock(NYSE: SQ), which has extensive exposure to Bitcoin, is number three.Robinhood(NASDAQ: HOOD), which allows customers to easily buy and sell cryptocurrencies, and Ark's own Bitcoin ETF are also among the top positions.
The fund's expense ratio of 0.75% is a bit on the higher end, but that's reasonable for a highly specialized, actively managed fund.
To be perfectly clear, you don't necessarilyneedcryptocurrency exposure in your stock portfolio, and Bitcoin (and related businesses) tend to be more volatile than the average stock investment. However, if you're a believer in the global cashless economy or believe Bitcoin is going to continue to move toward mainstream usage and adoption, getting a piece of one of these two ETFs could be a smart way to invest.

The index has fallen by 116.60 points, down 1.84% at 6,216.75 after closing 2018 on an annual loss of 4.72%,according to CNBC data. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average are also down 299 points — or 1.29% — at 22,969, while those for the S&P 500 Index dropped 1.24% to 2,474.
On Monday, the US stock market hadclosed the year on a positive notedespite posting its worst annual performance in a decade. The Dow was up 1.23%, or 265.06 points to 23,327.46, while the Nasdaq Composite Index closed on 0.7% gains, or 50.76 points to establish an intraday high at 6,635.28. On an annual basis, the Dow closed the year on a 5.6% loss, and the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq noted a 6.2% and 3.9% drop in their markets, respectively.
TheChinaManufacturing Index published its weakest figures since February 2016 owing to the ongoing trade war between the US and China. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, or PMI, which focuses on export-oriented small businesses in China, fell as both domestic and global orders weakened. The demand for Chinese goods subdued despite manufacturers’ attempts to discount them. New export orders also contracted for the ninth monthly session in a row.
“It is looking increasingly likely that the Chinese economy may come under greater downward pressure,” Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group,toldReuters.
The Chinese government is planning to roll out new measures to protect smaller companies from deterioration, mainly by introducing new loan programs and subsidized operational costs.
The US government’spartial shutdownhas entered its second week, with no signs of Congress approving the funds for the Mexico border wall. Government employees were told that they will not receive pay raises this year, which has led federal workers to sue the Trump administration.
As the chaos continues, US PresidentDonald Trumptweeted this Tuesday that he is open for a deal. However, that hasn’t improved investors’ sentiment.
Markets seemingly unaffected by the macroeconomic trends are performing better than the US futures.Bitcoin, for instance, jumped a little over 2% against the dollar on Wednesday, now trading at $3,864 according to CoinMarketCap.com. Ethereum has also surged impressively to reclaim the spot of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It is now up 11%, trading at just shy of $152.
The uptrend in crypto space has no strong fundamental catalyst behind it.

""History will enshrine the moment Donald Trump established the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve — a turning point in the financial and geopolitical landscape of the 21st century,""saidStrategy’s Michael Saylor.
Trump’s order confirmed that Bitcoin seized in criminal and civil cases would be held in a government-controlled reserve instead of being sold. Other confiscated digital assets would be stored in a separate stockpile, with decisions on potential sales left to the Treasury Department.
Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, praised the move, calling it “incredible execution from the Trump administration” andpredictingthat “many of the G20 will take notice, and eventually follow America’s leadership.”
Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ)reactedwith a lighthearted remark, tweeting, “One more hodler, the US,” while Tron’s Justin Sun declared, “Crypto in the U.S. is just getting started.”
However, Bitcoin fell over 4.5% following the announcement, dropping from its 24-hour high above $93,000. Meanwhile, major altcoins like XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) plunged as much as 10% after Trump's plan excluded them from the Bitcoin reserve.
Some traders had hoped for broader inclusion of assets beyond Bitcoin, especially after Trumphintedat a ""crypto strategic reserve"" that could involve Solana (SOL), XRP, and ADA. But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later clarified that Bitcoin would remain the primary focus.
The market downturn triggered over $550 million in liquidations, with most coming from Bitcoin-tracked futures.
Despite the dip, crypto executives remain optimistic.

Proceeds from the fundingwill be used for additional licensing to expand its U.S. and international coverage.
Co-founder and CEO Neil Bergquist told CoinDesk that Coinme is licensed to operate bitcoin ATMs in 29 states and will apply for further state licenses in the near future. As for international markets, Coinme has set its eyes on Europe, Central and South America given the high popularity of cryptocurrencies in these countries, Bergquist added.

Xpring is Ripple’s developer initiativethat focuses its investments in blockchain technology companies and is the firm’s first investment in the bitcoin kiosk industry.
Bergquist said Coinme raised $4.5 million in total in its previous financing, including $3.5 million in convertible debt, partly from Coinstar over the last few years, and $1.5 million from a venture fund in early 2017.
With more than 2,500 locations, Coinme currently services the largest bitcoin kiosk network in the world. Coinme began as a bitcoin exchange in 2014 and integrated its services with the coin-to-cash Coinstar machines in January.
The Coinstar kiosks allow customers to exchange bills and coins for a code sent to their mobile device that can be used to redeem up to $2,500 of crypto. The partnership was announced earlier this year with the kiosks mainly placed in public venues such as supermarkets.

Crypto kiosks and Bitcoin ATMs have quickly grown in popularity as coin use proliferates.
Data from Coin ATM Radar shows a nearly five-fold increase in the number of active crypto ATM installations since 2017. Earlier this summer, bitcoin ATMLibertyXsurpassed 1,000 kiosks under service.
Outside of the kiosks, Coinme provides concierge trading, high-volume transactions for institutional investors, and cryptocurrency retirement options such as a self-directed IRA and 401(k). Bergquist said one of the services provides white-gloved transaction services to high-net-worth individuals with a minimum investment of $5,000.
The new funding will also go towards developing online wallets for retail investors to help them use cryptocurrencies for payments and remittance.

U.S. stock futures are pointing higher after a market selloff on theFederal Reserve's interest-rate outlook; Micron Technology (MU) stock is sinking after the Nvidia (NVDA) partner offers weaker-than-expected guidance; bitcoin (BTCUSD) resumes trading over $100,000 and cryptocurrency stocks move higher after yesterday's selloff; Nike (NKE) is scheduled to issue its first earnings report under new CEO Elliott Hill after markets close; and FedEx (FDX) is expected to show income growth when it also reports after the bell. Here's what investors need to know today.
U.S. stock futures are pointing higher as markets show signs of reboundingafter plungingon the Fed'sinterest-rate projections.Dow Jones Industrial Averagefutures are up 0.5% as the blue-chip index looks to break a 10-session losing streak, including an 1,100-point drop yesterday.S&P 500andNasdaqfutures are higher by about 0.7%. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note are higher at more than 4.5%, gold futures are down almost 1%, and crude oil futures are ticking lower. Investors will bewatching for dataon weekly jobless claims, second revisions of third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product, and existing home sales for November.
Micron Technology (MU) stockis sinking12% in premarket trading after the memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner issued aweaker-than-expected current-quarter outlook. Micron projected fiscal second-quarter revenue of $7.9 billion, give or take $200 million, below the analyst consensus of $8.93 billion compiled by Visible Alpha. While the company said it sees a return to growth in the second half of fiscal 2025, it anticipates consumer-oriented markets to remain weaker in the near term.
After falling below thesix-figure price levelfollowing the Fed's announcement, bitcoin (BTCUSD) is trading above $102,000 Thursday morning.Bitcoin buyer MicroStrategy(MSTR) is up about 5% in premarket trading after sinking nearly 10% in the prior session, while crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) is up 4% after a similar drop yesterday.

The apparel maker hasfaced growing competitionfrom smaller brands both domestically and in other vital markets like China. The report will be the first quarterly resultssince its new CEO, company veteran Elliott Hill, took over in October.
FedEx (FDX) shares are edging higher in premarket trading as investors anticipate that theshipping giant will report profit growthwhen it releases its second-quarter report after markets close. The company is projected to post slightly lower revenue of $22.14 billion but a 3% year-over-year rise in net income to $925.1 million, according to analysts polled by Visible Alpha. FedEx has said it plans to complete a review of options for its freight business by the end of the calendar year, and analysts have said it may ""unlock value"" for the business to be spun off.

The merger wasfirst slated for March of this yearand was valued at around $1.25 billion at the time.
""Working together with Thunder Bridge Capital Partners, Coincheck aims to expand its crypto asset business by gaining exposure to global investors, accessing the U.S. capital markets, and recruiting talent to realize its growth strategy,"" Coincheck majority owner Monex Groupsaid in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing.

Mergers with SPACs have beena popular way for firms to list on public markets in recent years, accounting for more than half of all initial public offerings in 2020-2021, the SEC noted in March.
However, the slump in the crypto market in recent months has prevented some SPACs from coming to fruition. Bitcoin miner PrimeBlockended its plans to go public via a mergerwith 10X Capital Venture Acquisition in August, for example.

14144,2018-01-19 14:30:00,"Why Most Lithium Stocks Got Crushed on Thursday, With Albemarle Plunging 7.1%","Shares of the world's largest lithium producer,Albemarle(NYSE: ALB), plummeted 7.1% on Thursday following news out that rivalSociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile(NYSE: SQM), or SQM, had resolved its dispute with Chile's economic development agency. The deal clears the way for SQM to significantly increase its annual lithium production.
SQM's stock price dropped at the opening on Thursday, as lithium pricing concerns weighed on the entire group. However, shares of the world's second largest lithium producer nearly fully recovered from their more than 4% decline by the closing bell, ending down just 0.9%.
As for the other big publicly traded lithium producer,FMC Corp.(NYSE: FMC), its shares lost 3.9%, while shares of junior minersGalaxy Resources,Lithium Americas, andNemaskaplunged 6.8%, 14.9%, and 6.9%, respectively. (Trading inOrocobrewas suspended this week through Thursday due to anticipation of the release of material news. Indeed, the Australian miner announced on Tuesday that the trading unit ofToyotais taking a 15% stake in it.)
Here's what you should know.

The SQM news didn't come as much surprise to those closely following lithium miner news. Earlier this week, Ireportedthat ""SQM could soon receive permission from Chile's state-run economic development agency Corfo to boost its annual production of lithium considerably more than the market was anticipating,"" citing a Reutersreport. Indeed, this is what happened when SQM and Corfo met on Wednesday with the aim of resolving their years-long, bitter dispute, centered on Corfo's claims that SQM was underpaying royalties per its lease agreement at the Salar de Atacama. (The Atacama salt desert is currently SQM's sole supply of lithium, though the company has other development projects in the works. Albemarle also ""mines"" lithium from brine at Atacama, via a lease agreement.)
Greater-than-expected lithium supply on the horizon means that lithium prices should be lower than what analysts had been projecting based on their supply estimates. Albemarle, SQM, FMC Corp., and other lithium producers have been benefiting greatly over the past few years from booming demand, which has resulted in surging lithium prices. This dynamic is being driven by the electric-vehicle revolution, as lithium is a critical component in the lithium-ion batteries that power EVs. The lithium businesses of the big three diversified chemical companies have been driving theirfinancial resultsand stock prices.
Lithium prices have boomed in recent years, driven by the demand for lithium-ion batteries to power electric vehicles. Image source: Tesla.
Since SQM is the lowest-cost lithium producer, its increased production should give it greater power to take market share from other lithium producers. As to market share, estimates vary considerably by source. One solid set of numbers, though a couple years old, are from lithium expert Joe Lowry, who runs Global Lithium LLC: Albemarle, 22%; SQM, 21%; China's Jiangxi Ganfeng, 12%; FMC, 10%; China's Sichuan Tianqi, 10%; and other, 25%. These numbers have likely changed somewhat, but they should be good ballparks. The key point is that Albemarle and SQM are the dominant players, though the Chinese have been making strides in gaining share in recent years.
I'd say the market got it right by leaving SQM stock unscathed and punishing shares of the other lithium players. While SQM would also be hurt by lower-than-expected lithium prices caused by greater-than-anticipated supply, higher sales volumes would help lessen or potentially even neutralize the negative impact. Meanwhile, the other lithium companies would be negatively impacted by lower prices and could possibly lose market share to SQM.
While the Corfo news increases SQM's attractiveness relative to its peers, keep in mind that the company is based in a developing country and so has higher financial and political risks than U.S.-based Albemarle and FMC.

71627,2024-05-23 18:58:32,"Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Surged Higher This Week","It's been a wild ride in the cryptocurrency world this week, but it's mostly been a ride higher for investors in the largest blockchain projects.Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC),Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH)andDogecoin(CRYPTO: DOGE)have seen some remarkable moves higher over the past week, surging 3.3%, 28.7% and 5% over the past week, as of noon ET on Thursday.
The story this week that appears to be providing the rising tide lifting the boats of all large-cap digital assets is the expectation that a ruling should be forthcoming this week as to whether the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve spot Ethereum ETFs.
Bitcoin went on a run heading into the ultimate approval of spot ETFs for that crypto, and there was a flood of capital into this asset. This is a clear and meaningful catalyst for the overall sector and could lead to other similar products down the line.
Let's dive into each of these tokens and what to watch in the week ahead.
Some level of uncertainty remains on the ultimate decision from regulators for both the VanEck spot Ethereum application (due sometime later today) and the ARK 21Shares ETF application due tomorrow. Earlier this week, expectations were that we wouldn't hear anything until next week at the soonest. Accordingly, with the timeline moved up, investors will soon see whether these bullish bets were correct.
Potential capital flow into Ethereum could disrupt inflows into Bitcoin-focused spot ETF funds. Thus, the price action we're seeing with Bitcoin heading into this announcement isn't surprising. Ethereum's gain should (at least somewhat) be Bitcoin's loss, though it's worth noting that Bitcoin has still trended positively on this news, since it's good for the broader sector.
Dogecoin's price action appears to be relatively detached from the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. That said, expectations of greater liquidity in this space courtesy of institutional investors have traders ramping up on more-speculative bets to capture the maximum amount of upside today.
Personally, I think the safest place to be right now when it comes to these top digital assets is on the sidelines. Yes, there's some major upside potential should the SEC rule in favor of spot Ethereum ETFs. But I think the downside risk of a ""no"" could outweigh any future gains (and to be sure, a lot has already been priced in).
Various regulators have displayed different levels of enthusiasm for these spot Ethereum ETF products, so the outcome remains uncertain. Until we have an approval on the books, this is a catalyst I don't think is worth trading on right now.

The market data is provided by theHitBTCexchange.
After a prolonged downward trend, most of the major cryptocurrencies are showing gains on a weekly basis. This shows that the recovery is picking up steam.
However, even after the recent rise, most tokens are still way below their lifetime highs. Cryptocurrencies will have to spend a long time forming large bases, upon which the next bull phase will be built. It is too early to call a bottom.
A bear market is a great time for the investors to pick up the best coins at a bargain. Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit, has said that the current bear market has driven away all thespeculators, leaving behind only the true crypto believers.
That is a bullish sign because the die-hard crypto enthusiasts buy for the long term and will not panic sell on the next 30 percent fall.
After a new uptrend begins, new traders will start jumping in. The entry of institutional investors and the approval of a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) can provide a big boost to the crypto prices. Once an ETF is approved in the United States, othernationsmight follow suit.
EOShas been on a roll and has emerged as the best performer among the major cryptocurrencies, rising by about 35 percent in the past seven days. The EOS community seems to have been satisfied with the assurance of block.one CEO Brendan Blumer, who has posted in the cryptocurrency’s official Telegram channel that “great things take time.”
In his message, Blumer also said that he does not want to take what he called the short-sighted approach and push half-finished products out. Is this attitude good enough to carry the cryptocurrency higher, or is the rally about to hit a roadblock? Let’s find out.
TheEOS/USDpair is attempting to rise above the overhead resistance of $3.8723. If successful, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the lower levels. Therefore, the medium-term investors can buy on a weekly close (UTC time frame) above $3.8723, and keep a stop loss below the strong support of $2.1733.
If the price sustains above $3.8723, it could move up to $6.8299. Although there is a minor resistance at $4.4930, we expect it to be crossed. If the momentum remains strong, the pullback could even reach $9.30.
Both of the moving averages are flat, and the RSI has moved up towards the midpoint. This shows that bottom formation is in progress.
Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels, or from $4.4930, and breaks below $1.55.
The week saw some heated discussions among the Ethereum (ETH) community which led to Afri Schoeden, release manager at blockchain infrastructure firm Parity Technologies,quittingall Ethereum projects.
The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has largely received positivecommentsregarding the Ethereum mechanism. Will this open the door to a regulated futures contract on Ethereum? Let’s keep our fingers crossed.
TheETH/USDpair has been moving up for the past two weeks. It has risen from $103.2 to the current levels during this period. The 20-week EMA is flattening out, and the RSI is gradually climbing towards the midpoint. This shows that the bears are losing their grip.
A breakout above $167.32 will indicate strength and confirm a bottom at $83. Therefore, traders can buy on a weekly close (UTC time frame) above $167.32 and keep a stop loss of $100. If the price fails to sustain the higher levels after the breakout and dips below the breakout level again, it will denote weakness and the positions can be closed.
If the cryptocurrency sustains above $167.32, it can move up to $225, and above it to $255. Traders can trail the stop loss higher as the price moves northwards.
Coinbase will release a new wallet update over the next few weeks that willsupportBitcoin Cash (BCH). Major Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange OKEx hasaddedBitcoin Cash support to its customer-to-customer (C2C) trading platform. Traders can now buy Bitcoin Cash with one of the five fiat currencies supported by the platform.
What do the charts forecast for the next few weeks?
In the medium term, we don’t see any major bullish signals yet. Although the bulls are attempting to form a higher low at $105, it will take some time before we can confirm the start of a new uptrend.
A breakout above $239 will be the first step that will confirm that the bottom has been formed at $73.5. The 20-week EMA is also located just above $239. Hence, this is likely to act as a major hurdle. Once crossed, theBCH/USDpair will pick up momentum. The next overhead resistance is way higher, closer to $600.
Although short-term traders can try to stay on the long side for some quick profits, the medium-term traders should wait for a confirmation of a bottom before buying.
Binance launched the testnet of its new decentralized exchange, Binance DEX, on Feb. 20. With this, the company aims to offer its customers the best features of the Binance exchange in adecentralizedsetting.
Binance academy has risen to thethirdspot on the exposure platform Product Hunt. Binance Charity Foundation (BCF) has launched a lunch-based program in Uganda, where about 200 students and school staff will be given two meals in 2019.
BinanceCoin (BNB) has regularly been featured on our list of top crypto performers. Can this continue?
TheBNB/USDpair is showing strength. It easily broke above the resistance at $10 and is currently facing resistance at $12. This zone had proven to be a major hurdle previously, so we anticipate a minor dip or a consolidation in the next few days.
Both of the moving averages are flat, and the RSI has risen into the positive territory, which shows that the bulls are back in the game.
A break out of $12 could push the price to $15, and above it to $18, while a turn around from the current levels will find support close to $8.
Although we have been bullish on the pair for the past few weeks, we were unable to spot a reliable pattern or a good stop loss point. Because of that, we are not suggesting a trade in the coin.
Head of Blockchain Development & Digital Currencies at IBM, Jesse Lund, has hinted at a new partnership with Stellar (XLM), which has boosted the cryptocurrency’s prices.
Can this news change the fortunes of the coin? Let’s find out.
While most other cryptocurrencies are well above their recent lows, theXLM/USDpair continues to languish near its own. If the bulls push the price above $0.09285498, the recovery could extend to $0.13427050. The 20-week EMA is also located just above this level, so it might act as a major roadblock.
Both of the moving averages are sloping down, and the RSI is still in the negative zone. Also, the cryptocurrency has been a major underperformer in the current pullback. If the bulls fail to break out of $0.09285498, the bears will again attempt to resume the downtrend by breaking down to a new yearly low. Hence, we are not suggesting a trade in the pair.

Blockchain investment firm Fortis Digital Ventures is raising $100 million for a digital asset fund with an altcoin focus that aims to bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized finance (DeFi), according to a press release. The fund requires clients to have at least a $2.5 million net worth to invest. “Bitcoin remains a solid investment, but it is so widely traded now that it lacks the significant growth potential other more cutting edge altcoins can provide,” the company said. The firm was founded by the managing partners of Fortis Financial Group, a Seattle-based registered investment adviser with about $250 million in assets under management. The Fortis Digital team includes Mike Boroughs, who led wealth management at Fortis Financial, and Chris Capriccio, who previously served as the vice president of engineering at LegalZoom, a company that helps customers create legal documents online. “While still in its very early innings, we believe the efficiencies and value created through blockchain ecosystems will accelerate global GDP (gross domestic product) and usher in a new era of disruption and innovation,” Boroughs said in the press release. “Our goal is to help people get into Web 3 and crypto at the ground floor to participate in the upside of a generational paradigm shift in technology.”",30175.01,-0.12,30175.29,-0.12,30205.83,-0.02,29612.49,-1.98,30212.19
9719,2017-12-15 11:03:00,JPMorgan's quant guru says traders are waiting for tax cuts to unleash more stock market gains,"Associated Press
• The US stock market is not even close to pricing in the full positive effect of a successful GOP tax bill, says the JPMorgan quant guru Marko Kolanovic.
• The firm has a 2018 year-end price target of 3,000 for the S&P 500, which ties it with Oppenheimer as the most bullish on Wall Street.
• JPMorgan also forecasts that volatility will rebound from near-record levels next year, and it sees tail risks mounting in the second half.
Despite already sitting close to record levels, USstocksare a sleeping giant, waiting to be awakened so they can unleash more gains upon the market.
So says the JPMorgan quant guruMarko Kolanovic, who predicts that a successfulRepublican tax overhaulwill give equities a huge shot in the arm in 2018. In his mind, the institutional investors that control a huge chunk of the market are still in wait-and-see mode when it comes to tax reform, patiently biding time before putting more capital to work.
""The upcoming reduction of US corporate tax rates may be one of the biggest positive catalysts for US equities this cycle,"" Kolanovic, who serves as JPMorgan's global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy, wrote in a client note. ""We think that little is priced into the market and hence there is potential for market upside. Clients are not repositioning portfolios until they see the reform passed.""
This optimism around the effect of tax reform on US stocks informs JPMorgan's 2018 year-endS&P 500forecast of 3,000. The estimate ties the firm withOppenheimeras the most bullish on Wall Street, and it marks a 13% gain from Thursday's closing level.
The importance of tax reform to that call can be seen in the breakdown of JPMorgan'searnings growthforecast for next year. The firm projects that half of earnings upside — or roughly $10 a share for the S&P 500 — will be due to a successful GOP tax bill.
JPMorgan also forecasts that price swings in the US stock market will pick up in 2018 after almost a full year locked near the lowest levels ever. TheCBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, has been at an average of 11 in 2017, about 10 points below its historical norm. The firm expects the measure of stock market fear to climb toward 13 to 14 next year, with price swings beginning in earnest during the second half.
JPMorgan also sees record-low intra-stock correlations increasing in 2018, which could add to volatility. After all, when equities are moving independently of one another, they're more likely to offset one another's moves, leading to minimal shifts in broad indexes.
That uptick in volatility in the second half of 2018 will correspond directly to a higher likelihood of tail risk derailing the market, JPMorgan says. Of all potential headwinds, the firm fears the reduction of central bank monetary accommodation most of all. With theFederal Reserveset to start unwinding its massive balance sheet, JPMorgan thinks that could have an adverse impact on risk premia across asset classes, levels of leverage, and valuations.
""However, asset classes may not react immediately, and like a 'frog being boiled' tail risks may be realized with a significant delay and triggered by an unrelated catalyst,"" Kolanovic wrote.
In terms of how that tail risk may manifest itself, JPMorgan sees three possibilities: forced deleveraging of systematic strategies, disruptions to market liquidity, and failure of bonds to offset equity risk. As such, while the firm is still bullish on US stocks as a whole, it recommends that investors start hedging in the second quarter.
Now that JPMorgan has weighed in, here's a roundup of the other 2018 year-end S&P 500 targets on Wall Street, ordered from most to least bullish:
• Oppenheimer— John Stoltzfus — Target: 3,000
• Bank of Montreal— Brian Belski — Target: 2,950
• UBS— Keith Parker — Target: 2,900
• Credit Suisse— Jonathan Golub — Target: 2,875
• Jefferies— Sean Darby — Target: 2,855
• Deutsche Bank— Binky Chadha — Target: 2,850
• Goldman Sachs— David Kostin — Target: 2,850
• Bank of America— Savita Subramanian — Target: 2,800
• Canaccord— Tony Dwyer — Target: 2,800
• Morgan Stanley— Mike Wilson — Target: 2,750
• Scotiabank— Vincent Delisle — Target, 2,750
• Stifel Nicolaus— Barry Bannister — Target: 2,750
• Citigroup— Tobias Levkovich — Target: 2,675
• HSBC— Ben Laidler — Target: 2,650

The value of bitcoin has fallen by nearly 12% since peaking above $31,000 on 14 April, while the Nasdaq has risen over 2%.

21245,2018-03-04 05:28:12,"Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 04/03/18","An early weekend rally came to an abrupt end on Saturday, with Bitcoin Cash’s intraday high of $1,298.5, hit in the early part of the morning, all there was for investors to smile about as a bearish trend formed through the middle part of the day.
Bitcoin Cash’s failure to break through to $1,300 levels and test its first major resistance level of $1,305 likely weighed, leaving investors to lock in profits from the week and sit back and wait for another dip.
There was certainly no negative news through the day to impact investor sentiment and, while Bitcoin Cash gained 9.43% gain Monday through Friday, it’s been a relatively flat couple of days, with Bitcoin Cash ending Saturday down 0.48% to $1,267.8, following on from Friday’s 0.43% fall.
Saturday’s intraday low $1,251.7 was reflective of just how range bound Bitcoin Cash was through the day, with the low sitting above its first major support level of $1,250 on the day.
Things have not improved this morning, with Bitcoin Cash down 2.27% to $1,240 at the time of writing, falling below its first major support level of $1,246.8 early in the day, which could see Bitcoin Cash dip to $1,200 if there is no recovery through to $1,250 levels through the rest of the morning.
We’ve seen the peak and troughs through the weekends and, while Bitcoin Cash did hit a weekend high $1,298.5 on Saturday morning, the weekend has lacked sparks for Bitcoin’s little brother.
It’s looking bearish and any pullback through the 2ndsupport level of $1,225.9 could see Bitcoin Cash test $1,200 support, which should be strong enough to avoid a more material decline through to the end of the day.
For a reversal of the bearish trend, a move back through $1,250 to today’s intraday high $1,269.5 would support a run through today’s major resistance level of $1,294, though $1,300 may be a step too far for the day.
Get Into Bitcoin Cash Trading Today
Following a good start to the month, with Litecoin having risen 7.61% from Monday’s open through to an intraweek high $217.5 on Saturday morning, Litecoin has gone into reverse, with a bearish trend having formed through Saturday.
Litecoin slipped 0.8% on Saturday to end the day at $210.31, with a break through its first major resistance level of $215.5 sealing Litecoin’s fate, leading to an intraday low $209.16 before a partial recovery to the day’s end.
At the time of writing, Litecoin was down 1.14% to $208, with red seen across the majority of the crypto majors this morning, Stella’s Lumen and Ripple the only exceptions.
A continued fall through to $207.15 would test its first major support level for the day, which could see Litecoin test $200 support levels should a move back through to today’s intraday high $211.13 not materialize.
While it’s looking bearish, we will expect plenty of support at sub-$200 levels to avoid ending the day below $200, which would certainly be an outcome that would see selling pressure build through the start of next week.

Ripple had a relatively choppy day on Saturday, hitting an intraday high $0.92583 in the early hours, breaking through its first resistance level of $0.92056 before going into reverse, a trend that was seen across the majority of the majors on the day.
An intraday low $0.88326 failed to lead to a bigger pullback on the day, with Ripple’s XRP managing to avoid testing its first major support level of $0.87563 through the day, with a recovery to $0.89664 by the close, a 0.08% rise for the day.
The disappointment for Ripple investors will not only be that Ripple closed out the day at sub-$0.90 levels, but that Ripple has now spent 9-days without hitting $1.00 levels, while some of the other Crypto majors have managed to hold on to key levels.
At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up 0.23% to $0.89599, bucking the trend in the early hours, with Ripple’s XRP having hit an intraday high $0.91507 at the start of the day.
It’s been fairly sideways for Ripple since the decline from the start of the month’s $0.9635 high and for the XRP bulls, a move through to today’s early high is going to be needed to test the day’s first major resistance level of $0.92056. While $1.00 levels will be a step too far, holding above $0.90 would be a step in the right direction.
On the flip side, if there is a pullback to yesterday’s $0.88326 low, today’s first major support level of $0.87799 would likely be tested, which may see investors get nervous and lead to a larger dip before buyers return.
For Ripple’s XRP to hold on to the early gains, the major cryptos will need to begin reversing early losses, else we will expect Ripple’s XRP to reverse early gains.

6124,2018-12-26 15:27:39,Bitcoin And Ethereum Daily Price Forecast – Santa Rally Seems To Have Hit A Snag,"Bitcoin price has minor support near $3600 with the resistance around $3800 pushing the price downwards. Bitcoin might soon crash further downwards to test the $3600 support and if the support is broken, bitcoin might fall to $3300 in short term. What was widely believed to be recovery rally commonly referred to as Santa rally is just another dead cat bounce in reality. The rally came to an end on Christmas eve as the pair saw downward correction with the price falling below $3800 up to $3680. There is a major resistance formed around $3800 pushing the price downwards. The support lies around $3600 and $3650 but is likely to be broken in short-term if the sellers continue to dominate the market. Bitcoin is currently on the edge of falling below the $3800 resistance.
The long-term support lies at $3300 and if bitcoin price breaks through the current support around $3600 then it will most likely test this support. However if the pair manages to resume another bullish price action in near future with support at $3700-$3600 handle then what occurs now will be viewed as consolidative price action post profit booking from recent upside move. Ethereum price is holding important supports against the US Dollar and bitcoin. ETH/USD could resume its upward move towards $140 or $142 in the near term. The ETH/USD pair corrected lower and tested the $120-121 support area. However, buyers were able to prevent losses below $121 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.
A low was formed at $121.71 and later the price started trading in a range. The price crawled back above the $130 level, with a positive angle. There was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $159 high to $121 low. Moreover, there was a break above a short term bearish trend line with resistance at $130 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. It has opened the doors for more gains and the price may now trade towards $138 or $140. Besides, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $159 high to $121 low is near the $140 level. Therefore, if the price continues to move up, it could face resistance near the $140 or $142 levels. This suggests that the ETH/USD pair is currently on consolidation phase before beginning its next upward rally.

24827,2019-04-08 14:00:04,Five ways to buy Bitcoin online,"You may have heard of the confusing world that is cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin. Whilst many have taken a punt on Bitcoin, either making or losing money, there are still many others who haven’t. Not only can Bitcoin be confusing in what it is trying to achieve, cryptocurrency still isn’t viewed very favourably by the mainstream media. On top of this, buying and selling Bitcoin can be confusing for those who are not the most technologically minded. So here, we will cover five ways to buy Bitcoin online. Buy Bitcoin online through Coinbase There are a few cryptocurrency exchanges that provide fiat gateways. These allow you to send euros, dollars, or pounds directly to the exchange and convert them to Bitcoin. For newcomers, the most common exchange used is Coinbase . Through a simple user interface and its early mover advantage, Coinbase has become the number one exchange for people to buy their first Bitcoin. Whilst the site is easy to use, it is not one of the cheapest. Coinbase is known for charging higher fees than most. Coinbase has recently announced that it is insured for $255 million worth of customer funds in its hot wallets (wallets that can be accessed easily), with most of its customer funds stored in cold wallets. This should ease any fears about security on the platform. Buy Bitcoin online through Kraken Another exchange that has a fiat gateway is Kraken . An early mover in the space, Kraken has established itself as one of the main places to buy Bitcoin. Kraken also offers the opportunity to buy a few altcoins such as Ethereum. Again, as one of the larger and more popular exchanges within the industry, one would expect Kraken’s security to be high. However, for your own safety, once you have bought your Bitcoin, you should research how to store it in your own hardware wallet no matter what exchange you use. As strong and secure as an exchange might be, there is always the risk of a hack. Remember, not your keys, not your Bitcoin. Story continues For both Kraken and Coinbase and most other exchanges nowadays, you will have to pass the Know Your Customer (KYC) procedure to ensure that you are not engaging in any criminal activities. Through extensive KYC, you can begin to exchange larger amounts of Bitcoin on both exchanges. Buy Bitcoin online through Local Bitcoins Local Bitcoins is a platform that allows you to purchase Bitcoin directly from another person. The system shares similarities with sites like eBay, with buyers and sellers having a rating to show their trustworthiness. Whilst the system is set up so that those geographically closest to you appear on your searches, it is possible to purchase Bitcoin from anyone in the world through this platform. Local Bitcoins has the advantage that you will find cheaper Bitcoin through its website. Yet, as it is peer-to-peer, there is the added risk of not knowing who you are trading with. Buy Bitcoin online through Changelly Changelly recently relocated to Malta (like many other Bitcoin and blockchain businesses). This is because the regulations in Malta allow companies to know what they can and can’t do. In many other nations, there are still questions regarding regulations. Changelly currently has around 2 million users and aims to provide transparent fees and the best rates on the market. Users can purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through either Visa or MasterCard. Buy Bitcoin online through Coinmama Coinmama is another cryptocurrency exchange that allows you to purchase Bitcoin through either Visa or MasterCard. You can also purchase Bitcoin through a SEPA bank transfer. Coinmama has been operational since 2013 and it offers quick and easy verification and a selection of altcoins such as Ethereum and Ripple. Coinmama also offers a referral program whereby you can earn 15% of Coinmama’s commission on all of your referral’s purchases. So if you and your friends are thinking of entering the market, you can earn some spare pocket money. Conclusion There are a variety of different exchanges where you can buy Bitcoin online. Long gone are the days of shady exchanges or wiring money to Japan – such was the case with Mt Gox. Of course, there are always still risks when storing your Bitcoin on an exchange. If you are to purchase Bitcoin from an exchange, the wisest course of action is then to store them yourself in a hardware wallet. Many exchanges offer affiliate programs to encourage sign-ups, so if you have a friend that has already purchased Bitcoin, speak to them and see whether they can help and you both might earn a bonus. If you are to choose to purchase Bitcoin, remember to never invest more than you can afford to lose, and also remember that you can always buy a fraction of a Bitcoin instead of a whole one!

Bitcoin's price has rallied by more than 56% since the Nov. 5presidential election, but at around $96,000 on Friday afternoon, the cryptocurrency is down about 10% from its Dec. 17 peak of more than $107,000.
For investors and financial advisors, the question will be whether the selloff is part of a longer-term pullback or just the latest reminder of the volatility that comes with crypto investing.
“The crypto selloff has been wild over the past 48 hours, and all major cryptocurrencies across the board saw sharp declines since Thursday,” said Said Israilov, founder ofIsrailov Financialin San Francisco.
“This massive selloff was triggered by the Fed's recent announcement of expectations of a slower pace of interest rate cuts in 2025,” he added. “Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated two interest rate cuts in 2025 instead of the four they envisioned back in September.”
Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Asset Council of Financial Professionals and a member of theetf.com advisory board, shrugged off the outflows to simple profit-taking and withdrawals to fund year-end charitable contributions.
“I expect a much larger wave of profit-taking after Jan. 10 because that’s when the ETF holders begin to convert their profits from short-term to long-term capital gains, radically cutting their tax liabilities,” he said. “The wave of selling will create a strong buying opportunity for new investors, and the cycle of price appreciation will then resume.”
Edelman, who believes bitcoin will crest the $150,000 mark next year, expects a “repeat of 2024 in 2025, with bitcoin ending next year at another huge, all-time high.”
Meanwhile, Noah Damsky, principal at Marina Wealth Advisors in Los Angeles, believes the wild price swings and asset flow patterns are part of what people should expect when investing in crypto ETFs.
“Quick sentiment shifts can swing crypto prices wildly,” he said. “In the absence of intrinsic value, emotion drives the price, and this is what concerns me.”
Damsky said crypto investing through ETFs is a classic example of emotional investing.
“The FOMO is real on the way up, but the ride down can be quick and steep” he said. “This recent price action further shows that, in terms of risk, crypto can be like kerosene on a fire when the stock market is volatile.”

10003,2017-12-20 05:15:23,A 2nd House Vote on Tax Reforms to Influence the Dollar,"Economic data out of the Asian session this morning was limited to New Zealand data, providing further direction for the struggling Kiwi Dollar.
Stats included 3rdquarter current account figures, together with November’s trade data. It was negative all the way on the data, with New Zealand’s trade deficit widening from NZ$2,970m to NZ$3,440m year-on-year. Month-on-month, the trade deficit widened from NZ$843m to NZ$1,193m, which was far worse than a forecasted narrowing to NZ$550m.
November imports stood at NZ$5.8bn, rising above October’s record $5.4bn, with imports rising by $1.2bn (27%) from November 2016. The yearly increase was the largest rise in imports since December 1999, when imports had surged by 62%. The increase in imports was attributed to the import of aircrafts and aircraft parts, motor vehicles, computers and diggers.
Exports rose by 20% to $4.6bn, which was a new November high and the largest percentage increase since January 2014. The increase in exports by value was attributed to milk powder, butter and cheese, with butter prices up a staggering 82%.
New Zealand’s current account deficit narrowed in the 3rdquarter from NZ$7.49bn to NZ$7.1bn, year-on-year, whilst falling short of a forecasted narrowing to NZ$6.9bn.
The Kiwi Dollar moved from $0.69876 to $0.69723 upon release of the data, with the Kiwi Dollar down 0.20% to $0.6958 at the time of writing, the soft numbers coming off the back of a 3.9% fall in the NZ GlobalDairy Trade Price Index according to figures released on Monday.
There was little else for the markets to consider through the Asian session, with the U.S equity markets having closed out the day in the red on Monday, following the House voting in favour of the tax reform bill. In the Asian equity markets, the ASX200 was leading the way at the time of writing, up 0.18% as the markets hit the pause button on news hitting the wires that the House will need to revote on the tax reform bill this afternoon.
Despite the tax reform bill’s procedural error, the Yen was down 0.1% to ¥113 against the Dollar, with the Aussie Dollar down 0.07% to $0.7658.
It’s a relatively quiet European session, with stats out of the Eurozone limited to Germany’s November wholesale price index figures. We won’t expect the numbers to have too much of an impact on the EUR, with forecasts pointing to wholesale price inflation rising at a slower pace last month.
The EUR’s made good ground this week against the Dollar, in spite of Chancellor Merkel continued struggles to form government following the September general election. At the time of writing, the EUR was up just 0.01% to $1.1841, with direction through the day likely to be hinged on market risk appetite and progress on the tax reform bill.
For the Pound, following a quiet Monday, things could get a little more interesting this afternoon, with Bank of England Governor Carney scheduled to speak. Focus has been on Brexit talks, following last week’s in line with expectation monetary policy decision. Any talk of rate hikes could see the Pound break back into $1.34 levels, though as we have seen in recent weeks, how the UK government progresses in Brussels will ultimately be key for the Pound.
At the time of writing, the Pound was up 0.05% at $1.3392, with the Pound range bound through the Asian session
Across the Pond, stats out of the U.S are limited to November’s existing home sales figures that are likely to have a muted impact on the Dollar ahead of the House’s 2ndvote on the tax reform bill. The markets don’t like surprises and the procedural error left the Dollar on the back foot at the start of the week.
The markets will be looking for the bill to land on Trump’s desk before the end of the week, so both the House and the Senate will need to give the nod today. While focus will be on the progress of the tax reform bill, there will also be the need for a further extension on funding to avert a government shutdown on Friday. Reports suggest that the government will be looking for a 2ndextension through to 19thJanuary.
At the time of writing, the Dollar Spot Index was up 0.01% at 93.459, with the Dollar expected to get a boost from a passing of the tax reform bill and upbeat housing sector data.

• “Square believes that cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment and provides a way for the world to participate in a global monetary system, which aligns with the company’s purpose,” the companysaid in a statement.
• “We believe that bitcoin has the potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future,” said Square CFO Amrita Ahuja. “For a company that is building products based on a more inclusive future, this investment is a step on that journey.”
• Bitcoin’s price jumped 2.5% following the announcement, while shares in Square popped around 1%.
• Characterized by Square as a mission-driven investment, Square’s $50 million buy comes amid Dorsey’svery public spatover corporate responsibility with another crypto-friendly CEO, Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong.
• Dorsey chided Armstrong last week for discouraging his employees from engaging in activism in the workplace. Armstrong said it was a corporate imperative; Dorsey framed it as hypocritical.
• “Bitcoin (aka ‘crypto’) is direct activism against an unverifiable and exclusionary financial system which negatively affects so much of our society,” Dorsey tweeted in response to Armstrong’s blog post.
• Square is also now the second technology firm to go long on bitcoin in recent months after MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm, crowned the crypto as its treasury reserve asset of choice.
• MicroStrategy invested $425 million into bitcoin, according to a series of disclosures that pumped the stock’s value and revealed its CEO, Michael Saylor, to be an unexpectedly vocal bitcoin maximalist.
• But Square’s bitcoin investment is far more in line with its corporate identity and business services than was the case for MicroStrategy.

31466,2021-03-25 13:07:28,9 Ways to Awaken Dormant Crypto Holdings,"Before the decentralized finance (DeFi) revolution commenced, finding ingenious use cases for cryptocurrency outside of “hodling” or selling it to fund purchases was rather tricky. The idea of earning a return on cryptos outside of speculative activities was also inconceivable. All that changed in 2017 with MakerDao.
Since the DAI stablecoin-based lending mechanism was first unveiled, DeFi has experienced near exponential growth. The emergence of new projects and products has built an entire ecosystem of financial services that operate outside the purview of traditional brick and mortar institutions. From lending to asset management and insurance, the landscape continues to expand out towards the horizon.
Although these developments are making finance more accessible for wide swathes of populations that were previously unreached, the learning curve needed to participate in these types of financial vehicles was steep. Fortunately, continued efforts to expand and develop the ecosystem has borne fruits in the form of falling barriers to entry, a more intuitive user experience, and broader opportunities than anytime before.
For financial crypto analyst Luis Aureliano, who commands deep expertise in macroeconomics from 15 years of industry experience, the environment for cryptocurrency holders has never been better.
“For crypto holders, advancements in the ecosystem offer the chance to earn returns through staking activities. Staking involves actively participating in transaction validation by effectively locking cryptocurrency in a network’s validation node. For instance, Ethereum’s transition to a Proof-of-Stake blockchain will require staked nodes to confirm transactions. For each successful validation, the node is rewarded, generating returns in cryptocurrency for individuals who stake their coins in a node.”
Beyond staking, lending is also another popular area for cryptocurrency holders to put their holdings to work. “Just like the peer-to-peer lending revolution brought investors and borrowers together without the need for a bank as a middleman, blockchain-based lending protocols also offer outstanding potential, adding another avenue for generating returns without having to trade the underlying cryptocurrency.”
According to Luis Aureliano, here are nine of the best ways that cryptocurrency holders can leverage their coins and tokens to generate returns around the clock that beat a bank account’s measly interest every day of the week in 2021.
Many crypto exchanges are now offering some kind of interest-earning programs to their users, andKuCoinhas embraced this trend with gusto. It was among the first exchanges to operate its own token, KuCoin Token or KCS. KCS offers many comparable utilities to other exchange tokens in that they can be used to pay exchange fees and obtain discounts. However, anyone who owns at least 6KCS is entitled to a share of 50% daily trading fee revenue from the KuCoin exchange. As KuCoin grows, the estimated APR of KCS has been known to exceed an impressive 30%.
KuCoin also operates a lending program, which pays annualized returns of up to 12% to those willing to stake their cryptocurrency holdings as credit. It recently launched an automated trading bot that allows users to generate stable returns in passive income. You can choose between a classic grid bot, enabling a buy-low/sell-high strategy, or a dollar-cost-averaging bot.
Public Mintis a programmable blockchain platform that allows anyone to create fiat-native applications so they can make and accept fiat payments without needing a bank account. Additionally, for the average crypto user who just wants to make some earnings on her holdings, Public Mint is launching an Earn program based on its MINT token that allows users to earn some of the most competitive rates in the industry.
Funds staked in the Earn app are, in turn, used to generate yields in Public Mint's CeFi and DeFi partners, which is then distributed to users. You can decide to withdraw earnings in fiat currency at any time; however, those who choose to leave them staked will be eligible for more rewards.
Unlike many DeFi apps, Public Mint uses FDIC-insured financial institutions to custody funds, with each depositor insured up to $130 million. The Earn app will go live later in 2021.
The team at Reef is developing a smart yield engine and liquidity aggregator that can work with any DeFi protocol. As it’s based on Polkadot, this means that Reef can onboard DeFi protocols from any platform, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche. The project aims to significantly lower the barriers to entry for new DeFi users while also helping to streamline investment and trading decisions based on risk appetite.
Binance has spotted that Reef offers significant potential to level up DeFi’s game for new investors. Given that the project also provides an opportunity to connect DeFi on Binance Smart Chain to other platforms’ liquidity, it’s a win-win for both sides. However, perhaps the biggest winners will be those who currently feel intimidated by the complexity of the DeFi markets but now have a simplified route to capturing some of the value while it’s still relatively early in the game.
Cook Protocolis a cross-chain asset management platform built for investors and asset managers. Investors can use the protocol to choose an investment vehicle that's been provided by a fund manager. While fund managers get access to powerful trading tools, investors have access to a sleek and intuitive interface to make informed investment decisions.
The application is still in development. However, at its launch in the first half of 2021, investors will be able to choose from an array of index-based and actively managed funds.
The twist is that while investors may be familiar with these concepts from traditional finance, Cook Protocol is completely decentralized. It aims to make DeFi more accessible to investors from the retail markets. As the funds are based on blockchain, users can see the risk index and profit information for any particular fund for themselves and trust that it's based on actual data that hasn't been manipulated.
Pylon Financeoperates the largest ETH mine in the United States, and its PYLON token is the world's first and largest backed with tangible real-world income-generating assets. To take a real-world analogy, if ETH is like gold, then PYLON is like owning stocks in the company that mines the gold. The price of PYLON is negatively correlated to the rest of the cryptocurrency markets in a bear market, meaning that it is likely to continue gaining even if ETH itself is falling. Therefore, it serves a function as a ""safe haven"" asset in a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio.
Furthermore, the project has a mechanism for protecting token prices. The ETH earned from mining activity is used to market-buy PYLON tokens, which aredistributed as rewardsto PYLON stakers. This constant buying of PYLON from externally-generated revenue gives the tokens sustainable value.
The DeFi movement started with Maker's Dai, a stablecoin backed by cryptocurrencies. But arguably, it took off once DeFi innovators started creating ways that people could put their DAI and other stablecoins to work to generate income. This is the principle behindBXTBand its CHIP token, a yield-generating stablecoin.
The system operates based on CHIP and BXTB tokens. A user can mint CHIP stablecoins by pairing BXTB with another supported stablecoin. When they're deposited into the BXTB vaults, it generates CHIP and also yBXTB. Now, the users can spend their CHIP tokens while also earning yields from the yBXTB, which is generated from transaction fees when users exchange CHIP for goods and services.
The project's overall aim is to gain enterprise adoption of CHIP, thereby creating a mechanism for sustainable yields. BXTB uses its own consensus algorithm, making it faster and cheaper than Ethereum.
In the traditional CeFi world, people make money by buying company stocks on the basis that they hope the value of the company will go up and give them a return on investment. DeFi introduced some similar concepts in the form of governance tokens, which offer holders the chance to participate in the decentralized governance of a DAO.
However, so far, DAOs have been fairly limited in the range of governance options they provide to token holders.
MetisDAOaims to level up the concept of the DAO with its ComCo framework. It works on the principle that a DAO should operate comparably to a centralized company, with DAO participants collaborating on the development of a project by staking bonds as a commitment.
It also uses the concept of “optimistic governance” assuming that collaborators will generally be able to avoid disputes, but with a failsafe dispute resolution process for when issues arise. In this way, DAO participants will be able to extract more long-term and meaningful value from their governance investments.
DeFi has become notorious for its high risk-reward ratio. While this has fueled dizzyingly rapid growth for the markets, it’s not for everyone. Therefore,Prophecyoffers something different.
Prophecy’s Prophet Pools allow anyone to set up a pool with a defined number of participants, say ten. They also specify the staking amount in Prophecy’s PRY tokens. Say 100,000 PRY, and the success rate, between 60 and 90%. If we imagine our pool has a success rate of 90%, then nine out of the ten participants will be selected to win a share of the total jackpot comprised of all participant’s stakes.
In case you’re the unlucky one who lost out, Prophecy also operates “Second Chance Pools. The chance of walking away from Second Chance Pool having also lost is only around 4%. Therefore, there’s a high probability that most people will gain incremental profits, without high risks or all the complexity of DeFi.
The cryptocurrency markets have an extremely long tail in liquidity terms. BTC and ETH account for around 70% of the total market capitalization. Over 8,500 tokens account for the remaining 30%.Liquidifyis a liquidity accelerator that aims to overcome the challenge of lower liquidity in the long tail of the cryptocurrency markets.
Anyone holding a long-tail crypto asset can stake it as collateral in the Liquidify asset pool, which synthesizes all assets into a fixed amount of tokens, Liquidity Accelerator tokens (LAT) and Liquidify Tokens (LFY.) Anyone holding LAT tokens can use the protocol to convert back to their initial invested asset based on the real-time price. They can also swap them for other tokens in the pool.
In this way, investors can find new channels of liquidity for assets that may otherwise be difficult to gain any value from on the centralized crypto exchange markets.

89022,2023-07-18 17:34:06,"Crypto Trading Dropped 43% in Q2 Despite Climbing Bitcoin, Ethereum Prices","Spot trading volumes on centralized crypto exchanges plummeted by 43% in the second quarter of 2022, new data from CoinGecko suggests. And Binance—which has been slashing jobs as it retreats from key markets and faces civil charges in the U.S.—was especially hard hit. CoinGecko's report covering Q2 indicates that the world's biggest exchange has seen its dominance slide from 62% to 51% in just three months—a sign that Changpeng Zhao's constant cries of ""FUD"" aren't washing with crypto traders. The contraction in trading volumes, which was also seen on decentralized exchanges, comes despite a 7% uptick in Bitcoin's price throughout the quarter. Bitcoin Tops $31,000, Ethereum Nears $2,000 as Crypto Rally Continues Binance's woes also extended to the stablecoin markets, with BUSD losing 45.4% of its market cap between April and June after the embattled exchange made True USD (TUSD) its default stablecoin. The switch saw TUSD become the biggest gainer of the quarter after $1 billion was minted on the Tron network—that's a 50% rise. Tether remains firmly at the top of the list, and concluded the quarter with a 66% share of the stablecoin market. According to CoinGecko, things are also looking gloomy in the NFT sector, despite Bitcoin Ordinals reigniting interest in crypto collectibles. Bored Ape Yacht Club prices have recently sunk to a two-year low, down 88% from their peak in a torrid time for top-tier projects. Trading volumes among all NFTs fell 35% to $3.15 billion in Q2. And Solana—which has been rocked by multiple outages in recent years—saw demand crater by a jaw-dropping 79% as flagship collections migrated to Ethereum and Polygon. Bored Ape Yacht Club Prices Crash to Two-Year Low, Down 88% From Peak There was better news for Ethereum, which has largely shrugged off the threat of Bitcoin Ordinals. CoinGecko's data says 83% of NFT trading occurred via its blockchain over the quarter—but there is a chance this could start to erode as 2023 continues. And despite withdrawals of staked ETH being activated after a years-long wait, the total amount of Ethereum locked up by validators rallied by 30% in the second quarter—hitting just shy of 24 million as a result. That's worth close to $45 billion at current market rates, and indicates crypto enthusiasts are keen to get involved in staking now there's certainty over retrieving locked-up funds.",29724.97,0.07,29744.48,0.13,29791.44,0.29,29886.39,0.61,29705.11

2020,2018-10-17 15:30:21,Billionaire Mike Novogratz’ Crypto Fund is Fidelity’s First Custodian Client,"Galaxy Digital, a crypto merchant bank operated by billionaire investor Mike Novogratz listed on Toronto-based stock exchange TSX-V, has become the first alpha crypto custody client of Fidelity Digital Assets.
This week, Fidelity, the world’s fourth-largest asset manager with $7.2 trillion in assets under administration as of October 2018,launched Fidelity Digital Assets, a subsidiary of Fidelity that will provide crypto custodian solutions to institutional investors and accredited investors.
Through the platform, all 27 million customers and 23,000 businesses of Fidelity will be provided with sufficient infrastructure and services to invest in the cryptocurrency market.
In an official press release, Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson said that the long-term mission of the firm in the sector of cryptocurrency is to increase the accessibility and improve the infrastructure surrounding the asset class.
“Our goal is to make digitally-native assets, such as bitcoin, more accessible to investors. We expect to continue investing and experimenting, over the long-term, with ways to make this emerging asset class easier for our clients to understand and use.”
The core operations of Fidelity Digital Assets include assisting institutional investors such as hedge funds, pensions, and academic institutions to invest in the cryptocurrency market with appropriate institutional products.
Fidelity Digital Assets founding head Tom Jessopsaidthat the establishment of the company’s digital asset arm can be considered as the recognition by Fidelity of sufficient demand from institutions for cryptocurrencies.
Within less than 24 hours since its launch, Fidelity Digital Assets secured Galaxy Digital as its first custody client, a company that aims to achieve a similar objective as Fidelity to institutionalize the cryptocurrency market.
Jessop stated:
“This is a recognition that there is institutional demand for these assets as a class. Family offices, hedge funds, other sophisticated investors, are starting to think seriously about this space.”
In January of this year, Novogratz contributed $302 million to Galaxy Digital to build a full-service merchant banking business in the crypto and blockchain space. Months later, Galaxy Digital was listed on Canada’s stock market, enabling investors to directly invest in the cryptocurrency market.
Apart from its core business of investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects, Galaxy Digital offers high profile investors and institutional clients consultancy to facilitate large investments into the market.
“The resulting firm will have over 70 employees with deep institutional experience spanning across technology, investing, advisory, and trading. The Firm has also invested significantly in its management, operations, legal, and finance departments,” he added.
The partnership between Fidelity and Galaxy Digital is expected to lead to clients of the Novogratz-led firm to invest in the cryptocurrency market through Fidelity, similar to how prior to the launch of Fidelity Digital Assets, clients of Fidelity purchased cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum through Coinbase, a partner company of Fidelity.
The infrastructure of the cryptocurrency market, specifically pertaining to the institutionalization of the asset class, has improved exponentially in the past nine months.
Increasing efforts to strengthen the infrastructure of the cryptocurrency market suggest that regulated financial institutions are seeing solid demand for crypto from their existing client base, which could fuel the next major movement of the sector.

94514,2024-09-25 10:00:00,Kamala Harris says she will support crypto: Here are 3 steps that would show she’s serious,"At a fundraiser in New York City on September 22, Vice President Kamala Harris took a significant step by publiclyexpressingher support for emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, according to a report inBloomberg. “We will encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets, while protecting our consumers and investors,” she said at the Cipriani Wall Street event, helping to raise $27 million.
For the first time as the Democratic nominee, Harris offered a glimpse into how her administration might approach digital assets. While her comments signal a promisingproof of pivot, six weeks into her campaign, there is a growing urgency to address the concerns ofpro-crypto voters. This demographic—especially the younger, politically energized, pro-crypto population—has been skeptical, if not outright alienated, by the current administration’s approach.
What these young voters are looking for is not just clarity on bitcoin but a comprehensive legal structure for all digital assets. They are also aware that former President Trump has made significant overtures to the crypto industry, particularly by appealing to Bitcoin maximalists.
That said, Trump’s latest crypto venture—aprivate DeFi projectaimed at accredited investors—has raised eyebrows and accusations of opportunism, leaving the door open for pro-crypto voters to make a different choice. Given how razor-thin the margins are in this election, even 10,000 voters could move key electoral college votes inswing states, making the crypto community an important constituency.
Do you enjoy crypto policy discussions? Come join Fortune at Mainnet in New York City next week for a series of lively talks and top-level networking.
Harris, whose campaign is focused on freedom and opportunity, has the chance to bring balance to crypto regulation—and unprecedented progress benefiting not only the industry but the broader economy. If she chooses to capitalize on this opening, there are three messages she should embrace.
First, Harris can promise to deliver the regulatory clarity that the crypto industry has long sought in particular by putting a stop to conflicting policies from agencies like the SEC and CFTC. As someone who has spent years writing, teaching and advising this space, I understand the need for a regulatory framework that protects consumers while fostering innovation. Contrary to popular belief, regulation and innovation are not mutually exclusive.
In mytestimonybefore the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, I stressed the danger of continuing the status quo. Without clear guidance, U.S.-based companies may move offshore, taking innovation and jobs with them. Harris’s call for “consistent and transparent rules of the road” is a step in the right direction. By championing frameworks like the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), she could provide the necessary clarity for the industry and position the U.S. as a leader in digital finance.
Second, Harris must pledge to put an end to SEC overreach and rebuild trust with the industry. This should include helping entrepreneurs like Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, who have facedsignificant hurdles, including being denied a master account by the Federal Reserve. Such actions stifle innovation and discourage responsible actors from contributing to the ecosystem.
In my testimony, I raised concerns about the SEC’s broad powers and lack of clear guidelines. A fairer regulatory environment would allow businesses to innovate without fear of arbitrary enforcement. Although Harris cannot change laws directly, she can influence the broader policy direction her administration would pursue if elected. Indeed, some Democrats havealready shiftedtoward more welcoming pro crypto message, setting the stage for potential bipartisan progress in 2025.
Finally, Harris can make crypto part of what she is touting as a broader  “Opportunity Economy” that prioritizes empowering small businesses, lowering costs for middle and working class families, and expanding financial access. Crypto and blockchain technology can help achieve these goals by providing DeFi-enabled services, particularly for the unbanked and underbanked, who can save, invest, and build wealth with fewer intermediaries and lower fees.
In my testimony, I emphasized the potential of digital assets to democratize financial access and empower communities historically left out of traditional finance. While Harris cannot directly change laws, by incorporating crypto innovation into her economic vision, she can create opportunities for underserved populations both in the U.S. and globally. Embracing digital assets as part of her platform would demonstrate that crypto is a tool for real-world financial inclusion, not just a niche technology.
The potential of digital assets is too significant to overlook, and Vice President Harris has already taken an important step by recognizing crypto’s role in the future economy and seems to be charting her own presidential path. The crypto community, like many others, is eager for thoughtful leadership that understands the balance between innovation and protection, and Harris is well-positioned to help guide this landscape.

A steamroller was used to crush the hardware in the city of Sarawak, after the electric utility company of the Malaysian province accused the mining operators of stealing electricity for their activities.
The operators allegedly stole RM8.4 million ($2-million) worth of energy from the company. Authorities say the operation was scattered across four locations and six suspects have been arrested, between the ages of 24 and 64. The police chief of Sarawak says mining operations are becoming rampant in the city, and three houses have burned down as a result of illegal electric connections. Malaysian officials believe that electricity worth $21.3 million has been stolen by illegal Bitcoin mining operations over the past year in the country.
Elsewhere in the world, the Security Service of Ukraine busted a crypto mining operation earlier this month for allegedly stealing electricity from the country's power grid. More than five-thousand devices, including racks of PS4 Pros, were confiscated from a warehouse. Ukranian officials say about $256-thousand worth of energy was stolen.

46760,2021-08-09 14:38:09,New Exchange Listings And Cross-Chain Bridges Expand The Reach Of The Atari Chain Token,"The Atari Token branches out to new decentralized exchanges and cross-chain networks as it looks to attract new users and decrease transaction costs.
In the rapidly growing world of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, which continues to grow in mainstream adoption by the day thanks to big-name influencers like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, exchange listings are one of the most important factors in helping a project expand its reach and attract new participants into its ecosystem.
One project that has seen significant growth in its exchange availability in the month of July is Atari Token (ATRI), the native cryptocurrency of the Atari Chain and blockchain-powered VCS gaming console developed by Atari Chain Limited, a subsidiary created by classic video game maker Atari in partnership with the UAE basedICICB Group.
To show it means business in establishing its blockchain roots while also acting as a bridge between the old world and the new, the ATRI token is now available on both centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) as well as being available on multiple Ethereum layer-two solutions and competitor blockchain networks.
Centralized Exchanges Offer Access To Traditional Financial Routes
Due to the relatively short lifespan of the cryptocurrency sector as a whole, a majority of the world’s population that has reliable banking services exist completely within the legacy financial system and do not yet interact with cryptocurrencies.
As mainstream adoption increases and these novice users look to get involved with projects like the Atari token, centralized exchanges like BitBay, which listed ATRI in early July, offer enhanced security, risk control and KYC services and many also include trading pairs with fiat currencies like the Euro or the U.S. Dollar, granting access to individuals who do not yet hold any cryptocurrency.
The latest centralized exchanges to add ATRI to their list of tradable tokens are
1.Dex-Trade, an exchange that is based in the U.K2. The Estonia and U.K.-basedIndoExtrading platform3. The Vietnam-basedVinDAXexchange.
With increased offerings on multiple CEXs located in different countries from around the world, the reach of ATRI has never been this great and this is still just the beginning.
Decentralized Exchanges Offer Crypto Pros Access Without The Middle Man
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has been one of the breakout sectors of the cryptocurrency ecosystem over the past year as protocols like Uniswap revolutionized the exchange industry and offered a new level of unfettered access to cryptocurrency projects through a simple app interface.
Since ATRI is an Ethereum-based (ERC20) token, it has been available on some of the most active DEXs in the space including Uniswap and 1inch Exchange, which also offer token holders a way to earn a yield by providing liquidity in return for a percentage of the trading fees.
While Uniswap remains the most popular DEX in terms of active users and 24-hour trading volume, high fees that have plagued the Ethereum (ETH) network have led traders and projects to seek alternative options to the main ETH network in the form of layer-two solutions and competing networks.
The Atari Token signed astrategic partnershipwith the layer-2 solution Polygon back in February which has enabled the token to operate on Polygon and offer users lower transaction fees and allowed for the creation of the new ATRI pool on the multi-chain capable DEX SushiSwap.
Competing Blockchain Networks Help Expand Access
Decentralized access to ATRI saw a significant increase earlier in July when the token was listed on multiple DEXs, offering a good example of ATRI’s cross-chain capabilities.
ATRI will also be available on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), an Ethereum competitor that is backed by the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume in the world Binance, which offers transaction fees that are a fraction of the cost of Ethereum transactions.
This has prompted the team at Atari to launch liquidity pools on PancakeSwap and BakerySwap, two of the top DEXs on the BSC, enabling yet another blockchain network where users can access ATRI in a low fee environment.
With all these new ways for users to access the Atari Token so that they can engage with its expansive ecosystem, the tokens reach has never been greater and its future is looking brighter as the combination of gaming with blockchain technology continues to gain mainstream adoption.Image Sourced from BTC Peers

The move will give bitcoin exchanges, wallets and other crypto companies access to more than 3 billion people around the world who use the firm’s various platforms, which include Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook itself. Follow our live coverage of the crypto market The ban was originally introduced in January 2018 in an effort to prohibit “misleading or deceptive promotional practices” like initial coin offerings (ICOs), which spiked in popularity during the crypto market rally of 2017/18. Since then, the cryptocurrency industry has evolved considerably, with milestones including the first crypto exchange to go public through Coinbase’s Nasdaq listing, El Salvador becoming the first country in the world to recognise bitcoin as legal tender, and massive corporate investment in cryptocurrency through companies like MicroStrategy, SpaceX and Tesla. “We’re doing this because the cryptocurrency landscape has continued to mature and stabilise in recent years and has seen more government regulations that are setting clearer rules for their industry,” Meta said in a statement . “This change will help make our policy more equitable and transparent and allow for a greater number of advertisers, including small businesses, to use our tools and grow their business.” The policy update follows the social media giant’s decision to pivot towards the metaverse, which will likely support some form of cryptocurrency payments and other blockchain-based technologies like non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The news also comes just one day after Facebook executive David Marcus announced his departure from the tech giant, having failed in his attempt to launch the Libra and then Diem cryptocurrency. The crypto project faced resistance from lawmakers and regulators in Europe and the US, however the company was able to release a digital wallet called Novi in October under Mr Marcus’s guidance. Story continues “While there’s still so much to do right on the heels of launching Novi – and I remain as passionate as ever about the need for change in our payments and financial systems – my entrepreneurial DNA has been nudging me for too many mornings in a row to continue ignoring it,” he wrote on Twitter when announcing his decision to quit. “I find comfort and confidence in knowing that they will continue to execute our important mission well under [new Novi leader] Stephane Kasriel’s leadership, and I can’t wait to witness this from the outside.

7061,2019-01-09 11:47:49,Regulators say new EU cryptoasset rules may be needed,"By Huw Jones LONDON (Reuters) - New European Union rules may be needed to better protect consumers from cryptoasset risks, prevent money laundering and stop diverging national regulations from creating unfair competition, EU regulators said on Wednesday. Regulators have warned investors since 2013 they could lose their shirts by investing in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and ether, or in initial coin offerings (ICOs) that raise money for companies in return for tokens. Bitcoin rocketed close to $20,000 in late 2017, sweeping up investors from across the world, but it has since lost three-quarters of its value. The value of cryptoassets globally peaked at $830 billion a year ago, but fell to $210 billion by October, equivalent to less than 3 percent of the gold market. The European Banking Authority (EBA) said in a report on cryptoassets that they typically fall outside the scope of EU financial rules, making it harder to build a detailed picture. EU regulators have identified financial institutions owning cryptoassets directly, making a market in them, lending against cryptoasset collateral, and exchanging cryptoassets for cash, but have little data on these activities. Market developments also point to the need for a further review of EU anti-money laundering legislation, the EBA said. A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis would determine what, if any, action is required to regulate ""opportunities and risks"" from cryptoasset activities and related technologies, EBA said. The watchdog said a broad approach should be taken, including how high amounts of energy used to mint cryptoassets impact EU climate change and sustainable development goals. An EU analysis could assess the impact of cryptoasset activities on financial sector resilience, and the links between cryptoassets and traditional banking. ""Given the pace and complexity of change, it would be desirable for a technologically neutral and future-proof approach to be adopted in developing any proposals should it be concluded that EU-level action is needed,"" EBA said. FINDING CONSENSUS Separately, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said some cryptoassets fall under EU securities' trading rules, but that supervisors face challenges in applying them. ""Meanwhile, a number of crypto-assets fall outside the current financial regulatory framework. This poses substantial risks to investors who have limited or no protection when investing in those crypto-assets,"" said Steven Maijoor, ESMA chair. There is no legal definition of cryptoassets, and gaps in rules would be best addressed at the European level, he added. The EBA and ESMA recommendations mark a step closer to regulating the sector in Europe after attempts to find global consensus for rules have failed so far to go beyond monitoring the industry more closely. But finding consensus within the EU may not be easy either. While most national supervisors in the EU agree that cryptoassets should be subject to regulation, ESMA said, there is little consensus on whether new rules should fall within the bloc's main ""MiFID"" securities law. ""There were as well diverging views regarding the extent of that regulatory regime,"" ESMA said. ESMA said it would develop a common ""monitoring template"" that national regulators can require firms to complete in order to obtain better data. It will also study each business model involving cryptoassets to see if they should be complying with any EU rules. Regulators already have a range of ""robust supervisory powers"" to mitigate risks, EBA said. They should take a conservative approach in forcing financial firms to hold capital to cover risks until there is a clear set of accounting rules to help value cryptoassets, it added. Although the crash in cryptocurrencies' value has put off some investors, French ""Tabac"" shops are now selling bitcoins alongside cigarettes and lottery tickets.

62412,2021-09-21 21:39:52,Banks ask for space to grow crypto as regulators ponder guardrails,"The nation’s largest banks are asking an international body of regulators to give them the space to grow their crypto asset exposures, sparking debate over where guardrails should be placed on the emerging asset class.
On Tuesday, an advocacy group representing the eight largest U.S.-based financial institutions wrote to the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) regarding its proposal for a global framework for bank exposure to crypto assets.
“We find the proposals in the consultation to be so overly conservative and simplistic that they, in effect, would preclude bank involvement in crypto asset markets,” the Financial Services Forum wrote.
The BIS’s Basel Committee, the world’s primary standard setter for bank regulatory rules,published a proposal framework in Junethat would delineate assets like stablecoins from more speculative assets like bitcoin. The committee, which flagged “financial stability concerns” in the crypto space, proposes different regulatory approaches based on which type of crypto assets a bank has exposure to.
The FSF (which represents Bank of America, BNY Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, State Street, and Wells Fargo) urged the BIS to lighten the framework’s more stringent approach to riskier crypto assets.
The banks say the BIS should encourage banks to deepen their involvement in the crypto space, since it would bring the emerging asset class into the “clear line-of-sight” of banking regulators.
U.S. bank regulators have largely deferred to the BIS with regard to any approach, but Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said Tuesday that riskier crypto assets should be treated as such.
“To hold appropriate capital, if it's on a bank's balance sheet, would seem to fit into the remit that we've had in the past: that there be appropriate shock absorbers against a potential loss,” Gensler said at a Washington Post event.
The SEC is not a primary banking regulator; any Basel rules would be implemented in the U.S. by the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Under the BIS proposal, cryptocurrencies that are not a tokenized version of a traditional asset or lack a “stabilization mechanism” on its value would broadly be categorized as a “Group 2” asset that comes with “additional and higher risks.”
Stablecoins, for example, would likely not be classified as Group 2. Bitcoin would.
The Basel Committee would slap those Group 2 assets with a 1,250% risk weight when calculating a bank’s capital levels (a key measure of a firm’s health calculated as its assets minus its liabilities).
Higher risk weights require a bank to hold more capital against those holdings to insulate the firm’s depositors from any losses that may come from holding those assets.
“In other words, the capital will be sufficient to absorb a full write-off of the crypto asset exposures without exposing depositors and other senior creditors of the banks to a loss,” the Basel Committee wrote in its proposal.
At 1,250%, the risk weight for crypto assets would befar abovethose for residential mortgages (generally between 50%-100%) or junk-rated corporate bonds (generally 100%).
The banking industry wrote that the world of crypto assets is too diverse to apply one risk weight across the entire category, adding that the regulatory framework should also account for any hedges made by the bank.
“If...the prudential framework for crypto assets is too punitive for bank involvement in this market, competition may be stifled,” the FSF comment letter reads.
The BIS stopped taking public comments on its proposal earlier in the month but committed itself to “an iterative process” that would involve rounds of consultation as the framework is put together.

98756,2025-05-22 16:00:09,What Makes Bitcoin Depot Inc. (BTM) a New Buy Stock,"Bitcoin Depot Inc. (BTM) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.
Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Bitcoin Depot Inc. basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.
The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.
Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Bitcoin Depot Inc. imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.
The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.
This company is expected to earn $0.46 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2025, which represents a year-over-year change of 176.7%.
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Bitcoin Depot Inc. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 98.9%.
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.

The upgrade of Bitcoin Depot Inc. to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

13232,2019-02-12 11:20:03,Bitcoin Price Pattern Hints at Short-Term Rally to $4K,"• Bitcoin has backed off 4 percent from three-week highs seen on Friday, but looks to have formed a bull flag â a bullish continuation pattern â on the 4-hour chart.
• A move above $3,630 would confirm a flag breakout and open the doors to $4,000 (target as per the measured move method).
• Acceptance below the lower edge of the flag, currently at $3,546 would weaken the short-term bullish case. That, however, looks unlikely, as the path of least resistance is to the higher side, according to Friday’s high-volume falling wedge breakout.
Bitcoinâs overnight pullback from three-week highs hit on Friday doesnât mean the rally is over.
The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $3,560 on Bitstamp, having clocked a three-week high of $3,711 on Feb. 8. The 4 percent correction was preceded by repeated failures at the 50-day moving average (MA) resistance, currently at $3,633.
Even so, the prospects of a stronger short-term rally toward $4,000 look strong, as the price pullback has carved out abull flagon the technical charts. That pattern represents a pause, which often ends up extending the preceding bullish move.

A break above the upper edge of the flag, currently at $3,630, would confirm a breakout and could be followed by a rally to $4,000 (length of the preceding bullish move added to the breakout price).
BTC’s move to highs above $3,700 on Friday confirmed a falling wedge breakout on the 4-hour chart. The short-term outlook, therefore, is bullish.Â Validating that positive development is a bull cross of the 50- and 100-candle moving averages.
Put simply, the bulls appear to be in control and could soon force a flag breakout.
Bitcoin Eyes $3.8K After High-Volume Price Breakout
It’s worth noting, though, if the bulls don’t act soon, then the flagâs horizontal length (duration) would exceed the poleâs height in the next few hours, deeming the bullish continuation setup invalid. The RSI has also dropped into bearish territory below 50 and the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) is close to turning negative.
So, the bulls need progress soon to stop BTC finding acceptance below flag support at $3,546. That would shift risk in favor of a drop to $3,400.
On the daily chart, the 5- and 10-candle MAs are trending north, indicating a short-term bullish setup.
A bull flag breakout, if confirmed, could yield a convincing move above the 50-candle MA â a level, which has acted as stiff resistance in the last 72 hours.

853,2014-02-14 22:24:26,"Bitstamp to resume withdrawals, steadying nervous bitcoin market","By Sam Forgione NEW YORK (Reuters) - One of the bitcoin exchanges that recently suspended withdrawals of the digital currency on Friday said it planned to allow redemptions to resume later in the day, restoring some confidence to the shaken market. Slovenia-based Bitstamp, among the largest bitcoin exchanges, said on its website that developers had come up with a solution to thwart the cyber attacks against its platform that had forced the hiatus. It suspended withdrawals on Tuesday, days after one of the best known exchanges, Mt. Gox, suspended withdrawals indefinitely. ""After additional testing, we plan to enable bitcoin withdrawals later today,"" Bitstamp's statement said. Mt. Gox has not yet resumed withdrawals and has not issued a public update on the matter since Monday. Bitcoin prices continued their pattern of volatile trading on Friday, and prices varied widely by exchange. On Mt. Gox, where trading has continued despite the withdrawal suspension, the price plunged to as low as $302 early on Friday, but recovered later in the day following the Bitstamp announcement, last trading at $443, down about 7.5 percent from Thursday. ""The news that Bitstamp is resuming withdrawals restored some confidence and prompted people to buy back bitcoin,"" said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at WorldWideMarkets in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. ""The fear trade seems to have dissipated."" At CoinDesk, which this week excluded Mt. Gox data from its Bitcoin Price Index, the currency's price was substantially higher. There, bitcoin was quoted at $647.12, up more than 8 percent on the day. Adding to the choppiness were reports that the online drugs marketplace Silk Road 2 had been hacked and drained of about $2.7 million worth of the digital currency. CNN said the site's administrator posted the news late on Thursday. The first Silk Road site, which like its successor was accessible only using a special program that hides users' physical locations, was shut down last year by U.S. law enforcement authorities, and the man authorities say was behind its operations was arrested and charged with narcotics trafficking and money laundering. Story continues ""There should be no impact on bitcoin prices based on the reduction of illegal activity,"" said Sebastien Galy, currency strategist at Societe Generale in New York. ""It really indicates that there's nervousness in the market."" Galy said seasoned traders likely bought bitcoin after its price dropped. ""Professional traders would recognize that there is overselling based on irrational fears,"" he said. (Editing by Jonathan Oatis)",,,,,,,,,
26552,2020-03-24 06:00:00,Paxful Becomes First P2P Exchange to Partner With Chainalysis,"Peer-to-peer exchange Paxful has deployed Chainalysis’ cryptocurrency investigations and transaction intelligence software tools, the companies announced Monday in ajoint press release.
The deal represents an about-face for Chainalysis, one of the industry’smost prominentcrypto surveillance developers and regular partner of exchanges, governments and private companies. It had never signed on a peer-to-peer client because these firms were seen as too risky to conduct business with, said John Dempsey, Chainalysis’ vice president of Product.
“I think previously we categorically viewed P2P exchanges as a high-risk category,” he told CoinDesk.

In a P2P model parties move cryptocurrency directly between their wallets with no financial institution processing the trade. That represents a purer form of crypto dealmaking: bitcoin was envisioned as a decentralized P2P network, after all.
But P2P exchanges often play it fast and loose on the regulatory compliance front, said Chainalysis’ Marketing Director Maddie Kennedy. Some flout know-your-customer laws by allowing their users to work without an account, let alone identification required by law.
That tainted the category’s reputation and made Chainalysis hesitant to partner with any P2P exchange. “This is a reputational risk for us,” said Dempsey, the Chainalysis exec.
Dempsey saidPaxfulcame to Chainalysis looking for investigative tools. The company agreed to a partnership after seeing Paxful had “transformed its business model to prioritize compliance,” according to Kennedy.

Paxful Chief Compliance Officer Lana Schwartzman told CoinDesk the exchange began pivoting in “early 2019” after it realized its future depended on toeing the regulatory line. She joined the company in late 2018.
Earlier that year, Paxful co-founder Ray Youssefhad told CoinDeskhis exchange was “redoing our entire KYC [know your customer] process.”
The biggest playmakers in crypto are centralized exchanges. Binance, aChainalysis partner, moved over $800 million inbitcoin(BTC) in the past 24 hours, according toBitwise. Paxful’s not processed $30 millionin the past week.

25293,2018-03-31 11:18:00,Shale Drillers Are Showing Remarkable Restraint Even as Oil Creeps Higher,"Many oil producers started making their drilling plans for 2018 last fall when crude sat in the low $50s, using that price point as their guide. While oil prices have climbed since then, recently hitting the mid-$60s, shale drilling budgets haven't budged, which is a notable shift for an industry that had quickly adapted to changes in crude pricing and cash flow. In fact, in a sign of growing restraint, some shale drillers now say they don't intend to adjust their drilling plans this year even if the cost of crude continues to rise.
Intense oil price volatility over the past few years led many shale drillers to write their drilling budgets in pencil. After spending just $554 million during a turbulent 2016,Bakken shale-focused drillerWhiting Petroleum(NYSE: WLL)initially planned to double its budget last year to $1.1 billion because oil had improved into the low $50s. However, with crude prices sliding back into the $40s by midyear, Whiting cut $150 million out of its budget to better match capital spending with cash flow. It reduced spending even further this year, setting its budget at $750 million so that it could generate some free cash flow to shore up its balance sheet, assuming oil says in the mid-$50s.

The drilling budget ofPermian Basin-focusedLaredo Petroleum(NYSE: LPI)has also been a moving target over the past few years. In 2016, the company initially expected to spend $345 million on capex but revised it up to $420 million a few months later due to higher oil prices. Last year, the company boosted its budget up to $530 million before adding another $100 million by year-end due toinflating costsand an improvement in oil prices. This year, however, it only plans to spend $555 million, which it can fund with cash flow at $55 oil by year-end.
Laredo Petroleum could spend more money this year if it wanted to because crude is currently in the mid-$60s and it sold its midstream assets last year for $830 million. Instead, it's chosen to pay off $690 million in debt, pushing the total down to just $800 million, while using what's left over -- plus the excess cash it anticipates producing at current prices -- to buy back $200 million in stock. By opting to return excess money to investors and not drill more wells, Laredo joined agrowing list of shale drillersthat decided to prioritize growing shareholder returns instead of just production.
Others are turning their attention to increasing profitability this year. Fellow Permian peerParsley Energy(NYSE: PE), which has been one of the most aggressive drillers in the region, said it would not add any more drilling rigs this year even if oil keeps rising. Instead, Parsley ""need[s] to execute. We need to get back to firing on all cylinders,"" according to CEO Bryan Sheffield. That's after his company, like Laredo, got bit by service cost inflation in recent months. After budgeting $1 billion to $1.15 billion for capex last year, spending came in at $1.2 billion because ofrapidly rising service and equipment costs. Those quickly inflating expenses will also likely cause 2018 capital spending to be at the high end of its $1.35 billion to $1.55 billion budget.
By holding the line on spending, shale drillers will not only boost drilling returns and their balance sheets, but they'll keep inflation from worsening. They'll also avoid flooding the market with additional oil as they did last spring when they boosted their budgets and activity levels, causing crude to slide back into the $40s by mid-summer. By holding back this production, oil prices are more likely to remain in the mid-$60s, if not head even higher this year. That outcome would provide drillers with more excess cash to pay off additional debt and buy back more stock, which could help drive shares higher.
Shale drillers are resisting the temptation to plow their growing stream of cash flow as oil rises into more wells. It's a smart move considering that increasing spending along with oil has had a negative impact in recent years, especially on their stock prices, since many are down even though crude has risen more than 30%. The hope is that by holding back, shale drillers and their investors will finally enjoy the benefits of improving oil prices.

A recent post of mine on social media about relative strength received a lot of interest, so I figured that I would write a commentary about it. In the post, I illustrated the power of relative strength, or what I call RS, saying, “I’ve studied hundreds of indicators, both technical and fundamental, and nothing comes remotely close to relative strength (raw, not RSI).""
Relative Strength (RS) is a price-based analysis used by market technicians and traders to evaluate a stock’s price performance versus the performance of a benchmark such as the S&P 500 Index, an industry group, or an underlying commodity.
Before I jump into the “nuts and bolts” of how I have successfully implemented relative strength in my investing career, there are three common misconceptions I want to debunk, including:
1. RS is NOT a Signal:Relative strength is a secondary indicator, which means that I use it in conjunction with other analysis and will never take a trade based solely on RS.
2. There are Many Ways to Use RS:Today, I will discuss how I use RS, but understand there are many methods and ways to utilize it. What works for me may not work for you. Nonetheless, perhaps by reading this article, you can grasp some “golden nuggets” and learn to use RS within your investment framework or use a hybrid version of my approach.
3. RS is Different From RSI:I implement what I call “raw RS,” which is different from the popular Relative Strength Index (RSI) that many traders use. RSI is an oscillator, which I think has value, but that’s for another time.
Think of a stock as a beach ball and a poor (down) market as someone holding the beach ball underwater. In a down market, a stock that continues to bounce or resist the market weakness is worth watching further. Another way to think about RS is to think of a tennis ball versus an egg. When an egg hits the ground, it breaks (weak stock), and when a tennis ball hits the ground, it bounces (strong stock).
Historically, roughly 75% of a stock’s move is correlated with the S&P 500 Index. In other words, most stocks move up in bull markets and fall in bear markets. When a stock refuses to move lower in a downward market, the stock is sending out a big clue.
What will happen when the market steadies if you can’t bring the stock down in a bearish market? In an overwhelming majority of instances, the stock that held up best during the market’s downtrend dramatically outperforms. For this reason, it’s best to look for relative strength when the market is weak because RS candidates will stick out like a sore thumb.
In my personal investing framework, I utilize RS in various situations and for various timeframes. Here are three real-world examples from my trading history.
The best time to look for long-term RS opportunities is within a bear market. New, inexperienced investors tend to get frustrated and give up during bear markets. Conversely, savvy investors understand that bear markets present easily identifiable extremes.
Further, history proves that even the most bear markets eventually recover and can provide rich opportunities. The year 2022 was one such example. As inflation soared, interest rates rose, and war broke out in Europe, the Nasdaq 100 ETFsuffered its worst bear market in years, falling more than 30%.
High-valuation, fast-moving, growth-oriented stocks such asNvidiawere slammed as investors went full “risk-off.” However, in Q4 2022,Super Micro Computer, a high-octane growth stock, printed fresh 52-week highs while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit 52-week lows. Sure enough, after stocks bottomed, SMCI became a leading stock and has provided multi-bag gains since.
The beauty of RS is that investors did not have to understand that “smart money” was betting SMCI would be a leader in the coming Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution. Instead, investors merely had to notice that the stock was exhibiting standout relative strength.
Another powerful way to use RS is to evaluate how a stock acts relative to how it “should” be acting. In June 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission chargedCoinbase Globalwith operating its crypto asset trading platform as an unregistered exchange. As expected, shares dove on the news, losing 17% for the week. However, over the next two weeks, COIN recuperated 14% of those gain, which was a sign of relative strength. Over the next three weeks, the stock would rise 69%.
My most recent windfall trade attributed to RS was in the crypto sector. When trading a stock based on RS, looking at the stock in a vacuum is not enough. Instead, one should evaluate how the stock acts in relation to its industry peers and an underlying commodity.
Bitcoin fell 4.33% during the week of June 10thand 5.21% during the week of June 17th, dragging several Bitcoin proxies likeMicroStrategywith it. However,Marathon Digital, a leading Bitcoin miner, rose 1.04% during the week of June 10thand lost a minuscule 1.34% the following week – exemplifying classic relative strength.
When Bitcoin finally bounced more than 5% on July 1st, MARA broke out of a picture-perfect bull flag pattern and gained more than 14% in a single session.
• Sort your watch list by % change on down days and focus on the stocks that hold up best.
• Contrary to popular belief, down markets are far more valuable than up markets.
• Observe the action in sister stocks and related commodities to understand your stock’s strength better.
• Use RS to gain an edge and conviction, but also use it in concert with a full investing framework.
• Observe how a stock reacts in the wake of poor news. Poor news is bullish if a stock rises in the face of it.
Relative Strength, or RS, is the most powerful indicator I have studied throughout my investing career. Better yet, RS works off common sense, is easily observed, and will get you in the strongest stocks.

71650,2022-05-20 13:02:05,AUD/USD Price Forecast – The Australian Dollar Continues to Grind Higher,"TheAustralian dollarfell during trading on Friday to reach the 0.70 level. This is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area where we have seen a lot of action previously. It is interesting to see that it held, but at this point, we are still very much in a downtrend. The candlestick for the day does look somewhat bullish, so it appears that we have more of a correction ahead. Whether or not we can take off to the upside is a completely different question, and I would not consider the Australian dollar “broken out” until we get above the 0.72 handle.
If we turn around a breakdown below the 0.70 level, then the market is likely to go to the 0.68 handle, which is where we had bounced from previously. Breaking through that would open up the bottom of the market, but I do not think that will be easily done. Whether or not we can of the longer term might be a different question, but clearly, there are a lot of concerns out there when it comes to the global markets and economies. That typically favors the US dollar, especially against the Australian dollar, which is so highly levered to China, and the rest of Asia, as well as commodities. If demand drops, it hits those areas particularly hard.
It is worth noting that the Federal Reserve is still extraordinarily tight, so that also has driven the US dollar higher. The market will continue to be very noisy, but I think it is probably only a matter of time before we get an opportunity to short this market.

41442,2021-04-14 19:02:44,Dogecoin Exceeds $11 Billion Market Cap as Coinbase Launches IPO,"Julien Viry / Getty Images The cryptocurrency that started as a joke in 2013 based on a Shibu Inu meme gained 54% Tuesday to reach a value of $0.11, making each Dogecoin worth more than a full U.S. dime, based on CoinDesk statistics. Earlier in the day, Doge hit $0.12. That figure represents an all-time high for the crypto touted by celebrities Elon Musk and Snoop Dogg , Business Insider writes. See: Coinbase, the Largest US Cryptocurrency Exchange, Goes Public – ‘It Will Infect the Financial Universe with a Bad Case of FOMO’ Find: Musk Tweets Again and Dogecoin – a Bitcoin Rival – Skyrockets Doge started the day at 0.07. The rally brings Dogecoin’s market capitalization up to $14.63 billion at the end of the day, with a trading volume of $9.96 billion, according to CoinBase. Experts say that CoinBase’s direct initial public offering planned for Wednesday has driven the price of most crypto coins up, with Business Insider calling it “a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency space.” “One of the things that’s interesting about doge is that whenever there’s kind of excitement around cryptocurrency, people who don’t really know a lot about cryptocurrencies get pulled into the doge ecosystem,” said Adam Levine, managing director of podcasts and audio at Coindesk, in a Business Insider article. “And that’s partly because it’s cute, and it’s not intimidating. It’s partly because the tokens are very cheap.” Of course, celebrity endorsements on social media don’t hurt. Oddly, however, billionaire Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has stayed quiet about Dogecoin’s status in recent days, despite crypto supporters on Twitter tagging Musk. See: Elon Musk Alive, Well and Planning to Incorporate a City in Texas Find: Mark Cuban’s Mavericks Will Accept Dogecoin Payments for Tickets and Merch, ‘Because We Can’ The account @DogecoinRise wrote: “We Deserve A @elonmusk Tweet,” when Doge hit ten cents.

Twitter user @itsALLrisky resurrected the old “Guy Holds in a Fart” meme to share what it’s like “waiting for @ElonMusk to tweet about #Dogecoin.” Experts told Business Insider that “momentum” could send Dogecoin even higher as the crypto market continues to gain. With so many factors working in favor of cryptocurrency in general, the internet-famous “meme coin” could continue to rise without any Dogecoin memes from Musk.

89397,2025-02-20 12:05:00,1 new Trend That Could Drive XRP and Bitcoin Higher and Higher,"XRP(CRYPTO: XRP)andBitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC)have plenty of catalysts to support their future growth, and it's common knowledge that financial institutions around the world are adopting both coins for various reasons. But there's one new trend in particular that's driving those same financial institutions to take more interest in these two coins.
The trend might take years to play out, if it continues at all. For investors, that part could be great news, as it could lead to a new era of upwardly mobile prices borne from millions of people getting real utility from both coins. Here's what you need to know.
People trading in crypto know that Bitcoin and XRP are blockchains, and that the coins that live on those chains are associated with a myriad number of differentwallet addresses. One person could have many wallets, or only one, just like they could have vast holdings of the tokens, or only a small pile.
When Bitcoin was first invented, tokens were fungible. Put differently, every token was identical to every other token, except for the address where it resided -- just like the dollar bills in your physical wallet right now.
Since then, upgrades have been made to the Bitcoin chain so that coins can include metadata that inscribes additional information. That's one of the ways that the chain can now be used to mint, send, and holdnon-fungible tokens (NFTs). So far, many of the NFTs minted on the coin's chain are decidedly non-serious memes rather than anything that's useful in a financial sense or otherwise investable.
XRP has a similar capability. What's the point of a coin like XRP that's intended for serious financial applications, specifically reducing fees associated with international money transfers, having such a function? The chain isn't compatible with swapping images of meme coins or other more traditional uses of NFTs on other chains.
In short, this functionality opens the door to tracking real world assets (RWA) like properties, commodities, stocks, art, bonds, cars, and more, all on the blockchain. An NFT could contain the legal rights to a property provided that the holder could prove that they control the wallet address where the NFT resides. And that's exactly what's happening more and more on XRP and to a lesser extent on Bitcoin.
The push to track RWAs on various blockchains is just starting. As of early 2025, an estimated $7.6 billion worth of hard assets were tracked across the cryptocurrency sector. Some of the headier estimates for the growth of such tokenized assets see the total value tracked on blockchains to surpass $30 trillion by 2030.
Moving forward, at least some subset of investors looking to create a traceable record of their assets are going to use XRP or Bitcoin. In the long run, that could bring billions of dollars in value to both chains, pushing their price skyward in the process.
As appealing as RWA tokenization may seem right now, there isn't any reason to rush to buy either XRP or Bitcoin on the basis of this trend alone, at least not yet.
They aren't the only two chains in the running for tracking the world's assets. Many others have the same capabilities, and there is no guarantee that either of these two will win the fight for market share. In fact, because of how difficult it is to update Bitcoin, it's better to bet against its becoming the chain for tracking real world assets.
XRP may have a better chance, as it's being actively developed, and it's already in use by international banks for the purpose of processing money transfers. It wouldn't be too difficult for those financial institutions to tokenize the assets they control using XRP, and it'd likely be a lot cheaper and faster than trying to do the same with Bitcoin.
But it's unclear how much demand for XRP those efforts would actually generate at this early stage. Keep in mind that XRP's network charges fees that are a fraction of a penny for each transfer that occurs using the coin; there's simply no way that transferring assets could ever produce much in the way of revenue unless the transactions were priced differently.
Overall, the takeaway here for investors is that there may be a big addition to the investment thesis for both of these cryptocurrencies over the next few years if the RWA tokenization trend really takes off. Keep an eye on how much the major financial institutions buy into the idea. If it seems like they're all in, and if they choose either Bitcoin or XRP to be the tool for implementing the tokenization process, it'll be a strong buy signal.

98455,2024-05-02 21:42:27,Coinbase posts soaring profit on jump in crypto prices,"By Hannah Lang
(Reuters) -Coinbase Global swung to a first-quarter profit of over $1 billion from a year earlier loss, helped by an uptick in cryptocurrency trading following the launch of the first U.S.-listed exchange traded funds (ETFs) tracking bitcoin in January.
The company on Thursday reported a net income of $1.2 billion, or $4.84 per share, in the three months ended March 31, compared with a loss of $79 million or $0.34 per share a year ago.
Coinbase shares fell 2.5% in after-hours trading, after ending the trading session up nearly 9%.
""Despite a very solid report, the stock traded lower after hours with concerns that trading volumes will decrease based on downward movement in bitcoin,"" said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at investment firm GraniteShares.
Crypto prices rocketed after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the launch of a spate of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to the spot price of bitcoin in January after a decade-long tussle with the industry.
Coinbase is the custodian for several of the spot bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust.
Enthusiasm about the ETFs sent bitcoin to a new record high above $72,000 in March and renewed investor enthusiasm in digital assets. Trading volumes at the Coinbase in the first quarter came in at $312 billion, compared with $145 billion a year earlier.
""Keeping our cost structure low while continuing to innovate is really paying off,"" said CEO Brian Armstrong on a call with analysts.
In recent weeks, however, bitcoin has struggled as investors have recalibrated interest rate expectations.
The U.S. Federal Reserve kept its benchmark rate elevated on Wednesday after tightening monetary policy at an unprecedented pace. It signaled it is still leaning toward eventual reductions in borrowing costs, but highlighted recent disappointing inflation readings that could put rate cuts further off.
Higher rates have allowed Coinbase to boost its interest income. Coinbase earns interest on reserves from USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin it governs jointly with cryptocurrency firm Circle. USDC, a crypto token designed to have a relatively stable price, is backed by dollar and equivalent assets held in banks and other financial institutions.
Coinbase posted interest and finance fee income of $66.7 million in the first quarter, compared to $43.3 million the year prior.

BUSINESS INSIDER: What's the book about? What do you want people to take away from it?
JAMES ALTUCHER:My book is called ""Choose Yourself!"" because it's about the best investment – when we invest in ourselves.
It's about how we live in a word where all the large institutional structures that supposedly supplied ""safety"" to the individual are slowly disintegrating. The only way we can thrive as entrepreneurs, artists, innovators, or whatever we want to do to live successful lives is to choose ourselves for that success. No longer can we rely on the old paradigms (""school"", ""corporations"", ""government"", etc) to provide the safety and success we deserve.
In fact, it might be the only way to be successful, whether you want to achieve success in entrepreneurial endeavors, financial, artistic, creative, or any passion that you pursue.
I only advise what I have done for myself and I wouldn't presume to give any advice that has not worked for me. I describe how I hit bottom (more than once. Ha, more than thrice) and how I used the techniques I describe in this book to pick myself up off the floor and make millions. I then give other examples, stories, and testimonials, as well as talk about the economic shift that is occurring now that is forcing people to choose themselves rather than wait for the powers-that-be to reach down from the corporate skies to choose them. That isn't happening anymore.
And yet more opportunities exist than ever before. It's either an exciting time or a scary time. But, either way, it's our choice.
I had a fun time writing it. As a side note: I am very happy that Dick Costolo, the CEO of Twitter, wrote the foreword.
BI: Why make your book only available for purchase by Bitcoin at launch? Why make the paper-dollar crowd wait to buy it?
JA:The kindle and hardcover and audio versions of my book are all going to be available onAmazonon June 3. I like working with Amazon and that has always been my planned release date and I have a lot of fun stuff planned around that date including some surprising announcements and experiments I am trying.
Many people who self-publish right now are simply uploading their files and hoping for the best. I am self-publishing as if I were my own actual publishing company and doing every aspect of this perhaps even more professionally than a publishing company does things. I plan on describing the step-by-step in a separate post on what things I did here that are different than the average self-published (or even mainstream-published) book. So that's why I decided to keep June 3 as the official release date.
That said, the book is ready now, I'm fascinated by Bitcoin as a ""Choose Yourself"" currency, and didn't think it was a big deal to release it this way three weeks early. I don't expect a lot of people will buy via Bitcoins (I don't think that many people have Bitcoins) but I liked the idea of being the FIRST book in history to be, for a couple of weeks at least, only available on Bitcoin.
BI: Set us straight on Bitcoin – is it only hot for the moment or is it here to stay?
JA:At first I thought Bitcoin was a fad because I kept seeing daytraders gamble and lose money on it. Daytraders should not be daytrading Bitcoins.
But after extensive conversations with a friend of mine,Naval Ravikant, the founder of AngelList, he convinced me that Bitcoin is, in fact, the first ""choose yourself"" currency. It is not dependent on any one institution or person to bless its success.
He convinced me (plus subsequent research) that Bitcoin has many features that make it attractive not only as a potential future currency but as a replacement for all contract law. In one swoop, any economy that takes up Bitcoin as a currency will rewrite all contract law (eliminating the need for lawyers in 99% of situations), will eliminate the need for exchanges, and make international trade infinitely simpler. A lot of my answers, and a lot of the reason why I did this is based on the conversation I had with Naval plus subsequent research. Additionally, Naval was the first person to buy the book using bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a ""choose yourself"" currency. So I wanted to make this the first book ever to be for sale ONLY on Bitcoin if you want to read it before the final release. What makes it a ""choose yourself"" currency?
It is not dependent on any one person (for instance, a Federal Reserve Chairman).
It is not dependent on a government (for instance, a government that relies on a fiat currency).
It is not dependent on complicated central bank operations to have the money transfer from one wallet to another (every wire or transfer, or even credit card transaction) from one human to another in US currency involves the central bank at some level unless it is in small amounts like a cash transaction).
Nor is it dependent on ""In God We Trust"", a phrase that was first put on coins in 1862 to instill more ""faith"" in a currency that was potentially in trouble due to war.
Will it be here to stay?
Nobody knows. Ultimately, a government/country acknowledges something as currency if it accepts that currency as tax revenues. Else, it is not a valid currency in that country. Bitcoin is not a valid currency in the United States, just like gold and yen are not currencies in the United States. You can use gold and yen to barter in the US but it is actually very difficult to do so and most people would just as soon do transactions with dollars.
That said, for complicated transactions there are several things which are no longer necessary given current Bitcoin technology: an overlay of contract law (when people do a sophisticated transaction it often involves escrows, lawyers, banks, etc. to complete the transaction) and for international transactions, central banks are involved.
These things are not necessary for a Bitcoin transaction.
Furthermore, there ultimately will be a fixed amount of Bitcoins. This will get rid of the pervasive worry that a government can print its way to inflation, which has happened quickly in some countries in dire circumstances (Zimbabwe, Argentina in the 80s, Germany in the 20s) and more slowly in the US (where the dollar has lost 97% of it's value since 1913).
Whether or not Bitcoin is the ""winner"" it has several qualities that are going to be important for ""Currency 2.0"":
• It is encrypted, making all transactions secure and private. A feature our banking system does not have.
• It is peer to peer. Meaning, no bank or credit card company (or both) is involved in the middle of a complicated transaction. No ""wire"" needs to be done.
• It is decentralized. Meaning, a single bank (The Federal Reserve) cannot control all transactions. RememberNapster? It was centralized and now gone. As opposed toBitTorrent, which is decentralized and here to stay.
• A cryptographic record of every transaction is kept in every Bitcoin wallet. Transactions occur as the network ""approves"" them, eliminating the need for banks, checks, and all the massive overhead of processing transactions in a fiat currency. Such overhead ultimately leads to inflation, and mindless draining on the system that will no longer occur with ""Bitcoin"".
For these reasons, Bitcoin is like the ""Internet of Money"".
Will Bitcoin be the winner? Who knows. But the eventual Currency 2.0 must have the above characteristics and Bitcoin is the winner so far.
BI: Are you familiar with other currencies like Litecoin? What's your take on those?
JA: Very familiar with Litecoin. Litecoin is very similar to Bitcoin but there are small technical differences. However, the primary difference right now is simply that Bitcoin is first and for various reasons that makes it less prone to hacking or manipulation. Since the size of the Bitcoin universe is bigger at the moment, it is much more difficult for one entity to control it. For now, Bitcoin is the Currency 2.0 of choice no matter what Litecoin does.
That said, I do believe PPCoin (#3 in transactions after Bitcoin and Litecoin) has some significant differences and I will be adding PPCoin functionality within the next week.
BI: Do you personally own any Bitcoins? Ever bought anything with them?
JA:Yes, I bought my own book with Bitcoin. I haven't bought anything else with them. I prefer to horde them :)
BI: Are people wise to be dumping money into digital currencies right now, or has that ship sailed?
JA: I don't know if it's wise or not. Three types of people ask me about Bitcoin.
Technology people who want to know if I think Bitcoin is technologically sound (it is) and unable to be hacked/stolen (it isn't, if you keep your own wallet key(s) secure).
Libertarians who want to know if this is Gold 2.0 (it could be),
And daytraders. Daytraders are the only ones who should not be thinking of Bitcoin at all. It does make sense to look into digital currencies as a long-term replacement for ""normal"" currencies. But if you think there is only a one in 1,000 chance that Bitcoins can replace the US dollar, then only put that portion of your net worth into Bitcoins.
Daytraders, however, have no way of valuing a Bitcoin or the direction of Bitcoin's price. It is pure gambling. It is volatile. It is stupid to trade Bitcoins. It is just as stupid to daytrade Bitcoins as it is to daytrade stocks or currencies, which are totally rigged systems whose day to day movements are beyond the capabilities or machinations of most daytraders sitting at home.
(Here is why I am against daytrading in general.)
BI: Will you declare Bitcoin income on your taxes? How the hell does that work?
JA:Of course. With Bitcoin it is very easy to keep track of all the transactions. Every transaction is forever stored in your wallet. Additionally, in my logs I am converting everything immediately (on paper) to dollars at the second of transaction, so I can see the profits. Assuming I make some money on people buying the book via Bitcoin, I can easily convert Bitcoin prices to dollars and declare any profits on my taxes.

The short cycle time is not surprising given the crypto market trades 24/7, about five times more than the equity market. The 2011-2013 cycle was predominantly about BTC, as ETH launched in 2015. Analyzing the past two cycles reveals patterns that help us understand the anatomy of a crypto bull market. With the market warming up to the U.S. election and improved liquidity outlook, history might rhyme again.

BTC leads Altcoins into the Rally
In both the 2015-2017 and 2019-2021 cycles, Bitcoin initially led the market surge, establishing confidence and setting the stage for a broader rally. As investor optimism grew, capital flowed into altcoins, driving a broad-based market rally. Altcoins’ market cap peaks often coincided with BTC’s market cap dominance bottom, indicating capital rotation from BTC to alts. Currently, BTC dominance is still climbing from the post-FTX low, suggesting more room for BTC to run before alts catch up.
Altcoins Significantly Outperform in Later Half of the Cycle
In both major cycles, altcoins significantly outperformed Bitcoin after an initial phase where their returns were comparable. This trend reflects investors' increased risk appetite and how reflexive the alts market can be with increased risk capital. In the second half of the 2015-2017 cycle, alts returned 344x versus BTC’s 26x. Similarly, in the second half of the 2019-2021 cycle, alts returned 16x versus BTC’s 5x. We are about halfway through the current cycle post-FTX, with alts slightly lagging behind BTC. This trend suggests a potential altcoin outperformance in the second half.
Macro Economic Influence
Crypto, like other risky assets, is highly correlated with global net liquidity conditions. In the past two cycles, global net liquidity increased by 30-50%. The recent Q2 selloff was partially driven by tightened liquidity conditions. However, as Q2 data confirmed a slowdown in inflation and growth, the trajectory for a Fed rate cut looks favorable.
The market now prices in a more than 95% chance of a rate cut in September, up from 50% at the beginning of Q3. Additionally, crypto policy is becoming central in the U.S. election, with Trump endorsing crypto, which may influence the new Democratic candidate. The past two cycles also overlapped with US elections and BTC halving events, adding to the rally potential.
Could This Time Be Different?
While history doesn’t repeat exactly, the rhyming nature of past cycles — initial Bitcoin dominance, subsequent altcoin outperformance, and macroeconomic influences—sets up for an altcoin rally. However, this time could be different. On the positive side, BTC and ETH have reached mainstream adoption through ETFs, with record inflows from retail investors and institutions.
On the cautious side, a larger and more diverse set of altcoins competes for investor capital, and many new projects have limited circulating supply due to airdrops, leading to future dilution. Only ecosystems with solid technology and the ability to attract builders and users may thrive in this cycle.",66460.0,0.04,66450.01,0.03,66774.01,0.51,66417.99,-0.02,66432.0

Bitcoin has surged nearly 40% in just five weeks, bouncing from its April lows and reclaiming critical technical levels. But this weekend, a fresh political catalyst added fuel to the move — even if only temporarily.
Late Saturday evening, PresidentDonald Trumpposted on Truth Socialabout a pivotal meeting with China that took place in Switzerland. His post read:""Very good meeting today with China... A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner... GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!""

That single post stirred global sentiment — and Bitcoin didn't ignore it. Within the hour of Trump's announcement, Bitcoin jumped 1.40%, rallying from $103,500 to a high of $105,000. However, the momentum was short-lived. The rally stalled almost exactly at a key weekly resistance level of $104,460, where price was quickly rejected.
Bitcoin's reaction to the Trump announcement shows the importance of technical levels. Despite the burst of optimism, price couldn't break above resistance on the weekly chart, which has been a ceiling in recent sessions.
• Weekly Resistance:$104,460
• Current Range:$102,240 – $105,000
• Trump Announcement Spike High:$105,000
While broader sentiment remains bullish, traders are watching closely to see if Bitcoin can finally punch through this resistance or if this was simply another failed breakout attempt.
On the hourly timeframe, Bitcoin is still holding higher lows, but there are early signals of weakening momentum. Price has failed to extend past the recent highs, and it's currently hovering right back around the $104,460 resistance — where the initial Trump rally was rejected.
If bulls can't defend current levels, a breakdown below short-term support could be next.

• Support to Hold (Hourly):$103,000A break below could trigger downside momentum towards $99,163 – $100,00.
• Psychological Support:$100,000A critical level likely to attract buyers if tested.
• Resistance:$104,460Must be flipped into support for continuation higher.
While Trump's announcement gave the market a brief jolt, traders remain cautious. The reaction suggests geopolitical headlines still have sway — especially those involving U.S.-China relations — but ultimately, price action rules the game.
For now, Bitcoin remains in a short-term uptrend, but the battle at $104,460 is key. A strong push above that level could open the door to retesting ATHs, while failure could lead to a retest of the much-watched $100,000 mark.
As always, stay nimble. Headlines may spark movement, but only the charts confirm the trade.

3832,2018-11-25 21:50:50,Malta: Does Europe’s ‘Blockchain Island’ Really Live up to the Hype?,"Malta Blockchain Island Malta. The Blockchain Island. A postage-stamp-sized nation nestled in the Mediterranean famous for its rocky coastline, Baroque cathedrals, Megalithic temples, and centuries of culture. It’s a veritable mishmash of graying British expats, luxurious hotels, exotic women, cars that drive on the left, and a host of other legacies left by the various civilizations that invaded the rock over the years. In more recent times, however, Malta has become famous for more than its rich heritage. It’s made a welcoming home for the iGaming sector (a booming industry worth around $1.4 billion — 12 percent of Malta’s GDP). In the face of a long and drawn-out European crisis and deficits year after year, Malta was finally able to register a surplus of €182 million for 2017 — its second year in a row. And the country is being talked about in blockchain regulatory circles for its progressive stance on cryptocurrency, even rebranding as “The Blockchain Island.” Its government is open-minded, and its Prime Minister Joseph Muscat gave a compelling speech to the United Nations about how countries should work together to solve the world’s problems. However, Malta has a few problems of its own — and a less-than-impeccable past when it comes to some very sticky issues, money laundering among them. Malta the Blockchain Island On the surface, Malta looks to be a pioneer in the cryptocurrency regulation space. On July 4, 2018, it became the first and only country to officially pass three new crypto bills into law. This established a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and DLT in general. 2018 was also the first year that the country held its long-anticipated Malta Blockchain Summit. When asked about the significance of this for Malta and the crypto community in general, Steve Tendon, blockchain strategist and member of Malta’s National Blockchain Task Force said: “It will be the first event ever where Malta’s intention to recognize “Legal Personality” to the innovative technology arrangements (like DAOs) will be presented to a broad international audience. This is an innovation in lawmaking that will support innovation like no other law has ever done.” Story continues Malta didn’t just pass three laws as the headlines tend to focus on, they have a whole National Blockchain Strategy penned by Tendon, with six pillars that show a deep understanding of the technology and where it’s going. It covers initiatives like moving public registries to the blockchain, e-residency and digital identity, and smart governance. blockchain strategy Said Tendon: “This will undoubtedly attract all the developers and entrepreneurs who are working on decentralized technologies of all kinds, such as new generation of blockchains, decentralized exchanges, decentralized ICO platforms, decentralized banking services, and so on.” You can see clearly that this is just the beginning. Malta is not just aiming to lead the way in regulating ICOs but showing governments the need to understand rather than fear the technology. At the same time, the country is positioning itself as open for business among a sea of tightly-shut doors. Attracting Major Crypto Businesses This forward-thinking regulatory stance has already inspired an influx of blockchain companies to its shores, most notably Binance and a litany of other crypto exchanges. It’s not that Malta is easy on crypto companies — according to Tendon, its KYC requirements are among the toughest out there — but at least it provides companies with a stable environment in which to operate, one in which their business isn’t at risk of being shut down from one day to the next, their token declared a security, or their government known for its hostility to crypto. Malta’s progress is undeniable. I was recently at the Summit that attracted some 8,500 delegates. The place was packed at the seams and momentum sky-high. Muscat gave a speech. Sophia the robot was there, even John McAfee delivered a keynote commending Malta’s stance…and then pretty much concluding that governments had no place regulating crypto at all. john mcafee crypto But it’s one thing laying the foundations for a new future. It’s another if you’re still scrambling to cover up your past. The Money Laundering Issue and Lack of Crypto Banks There is certainly positive rhetoric, a buzzing atmosphere, real legislation, and the promise that Malta will see crypto-friendly banks in 2019. But legacy banks are still not coming around. Their standards are higher, along with the fear of being slapped with a massive fine for being too lax on their AML policies. Just ask Deutsche Bank if you want confirmation of that. While Binance is working on the first decentralized bank in the world, crypto businesses may have to wait a bit longer. And if they think that Malta is their meal ticket to a safe haven, they may also need to dig a little deeper. Malta has a history of working with less-than-desirable individuals. It seems that beyond gaming, innovation, and technology, the country’s name is also somewhat synonymous with money laundering. Malta has been mentioned in a number of cases including that of Matthias Krull, a German banker working for the Swiss private bank Julius Baer, who admitted to laundering money for “Los Chamos,” thought to be connected with Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro. There’s also the tragic assassination of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia who, before she died, had accused the Pilatus Bank of Malta of laundering money. This thrust Malta into the global spotlight over freedom and safety of the press and the Pilatus Bank under the microscope of the European Central Bank (ECB). Caruana Galizia had also accused the bank of making suspicious payments to senior Maltese and Azerbaijani figures. The bank had its accounts frozen in March and was eventually shut down by the Maltese FSA later in the year. Then there’s the issue that the EU is currently furious with Malta over Muscat’s latest public blunder. According to Bloomberg: “The union’s least-populous member nation has become a cryptocurrency and online gambling hub plagued by allegations of corruption and money laundering. And it’s selling passports.” While the country was on a high after announcing its second year turning in a profit, Muscat announced that the government would donate €5 million to a cancer charity. This turned out to be a move welcomed by no one after it emerged that the donation would come from a fund that sells Maltese passports to foreigners for €650,000 apiece. Once again, the whole touchy subject of Malta’s tenuous relations with undesirable individuals reared its ugly head, calling Maltese AML practices into question and rekindling the flame on the aforementioned issues. So is Malta, the Blockchain Island, More than Just Hype? Clearly, Malta’s presence on the global money laundering stage is a fairly large and potentially concerning one. Some governments, according to Bloomberg, even argue that Malta could pose: “a serious threat to global efforts to track money laundering, enforce economic sanctions, and maintain fair transnational standards.” There’s also the fact that many banks will not work with crypto companies yet and some businesses may not want to associate themselves with Malta and its sketchy past (or should we say present?). But then again, there’s no denying the progress being made. Malta’s new regulator, the Malta Digital Innovation Authority, is about more than just blockchain or Bitcoin . It’s about innovation itself and other emerging technologies, positioning the country as advanced and open to a world of possibilities. Blockchain takes a beating from all sides for failure to attract the masses, for not being simple enough to use, and for being unregulated and unsafe. So, it’s encouraging to see countries diving into the depths, displaying a deep understanding, and welcoming crypto to its shores — even if it is a little lenient on who it does business with.

206716,2023-08-18 07:58:18,Bitcoin drops to new two-month low as world markets sell off,"By Elizabeth Howcroft LONDON (Reuters) -Top cryptocurrency bitcoin hit a fresh two-month low on Friday, breaking out of its recent tight range as a wave of risk averse sentiment swept through world markets. On Thursday, bitcoin fell 7.2% in its biggest one-day drop since November 2022 when top exchange FTX collapsed. It then slipped to a two-month low of $26,172 during Asian trading hours on Friday, its lowest since June 16. By 0835 GMT, it had partly recovered to $26,441, down 0.8% on the day. Global markets have been hit by a wave of selling, with Wall Street's main indexes closing lower on Thursday and Asian shares heading for a third week of losses over concerns about China's economy and fears that U.S. interest rates would stay higher for longer given a resilient economy. Ether, the second biggest cryptocurrency, was steady at $1,685.20, having also dropped sharply on Thursday. Some analysts attributed crypto's drop to a Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk's SpaceX sold its bitcoin holdings after writing the value down by $373 million. Musk is influential among crypto enthusiasts, and bitcoin prices have previously moved in response to his tweets. The SpaceX report was the ""immediate catalyst"" for bitcoin's sell-off, said Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at eToro. ""The broader driver is that crypto assets are not immune to the deepening risk-off selling pressure seen across all asset classes,"" Laidler added. Joseph Edwards, head of research at Enigma Securities, attributed the bitcoin price move to low volatility and a lack of enthusiasm from retail investors. Bitcoin had been hovering close to $30,000 in recent months, having gradually recovered this year after dropping sharply in 2022 when various crypto firms collapsed, leaving investors with large losses. Crypto markets were boosted in June by BlackRock applying to launch a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Some investors interpreted that move as an indication that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would approve spot bitcoin ETF applications from various asset managers, including Grayscale. ""The big concern right now is that this might be a frontrun on the outcome of Grayscale's lawsuit against the SEC; optimism on that front has been keeping markets inflated above whether they might otherwise be for much of the summer,"" Edwards said.

""Officially, my campaign is accepting bitcoin,"" Suarez said. ""This is a process of developing technologies that are going to create democratizing opportunities for wealth creation and are not manipulated by a human being's ulterior motives, political goals, etc."" he said. Supporters can donate as little as 0.00034 bitcoin, or the equivalent of $1, at FrancisSuarez.com , he said. Suarez was critical of the Biden administration's handling of crypto. ""The biggest mistake that this administration has made is they don't understand crypto, so they have gone to a regulated-by-enforcement mechanism as opposed to set the ground rules,"" Suarez said on CoinDesk TV. ""You have to be able to classify certain digital products, you have to be able to have certain guidelines and rules that are clear with respect to the custody of assets."" Suarez also said that he would ban a central bank digital currency. ""Nobody wants the federal government knowing where you have your money and how much money you have ... I don't think that there's anything particularly innovative about that,"" he said. Suarez, a Republican, announced his candidacy for president in June, entering a crowded race for the GOP nomination that includes front-runners former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The move to allow bitcoin payments for donations should come as no surprise given that the Miami mayor has long been an advocate for digital assets, specifically bitcoin, which he has said will have a “democratizing impact on the future of wealth for every American.” He has vowed to make Miami a bitcoin hub and has accepted his salary in bitcoin. Suarez has already experimented with crypto assets in multiple areas, including by launching MiamiCoin (MIA) in 2021, which he planned to someday be used to pay a recurring bitcoin stimulus to Miami citizens, similar to a dividend paid to shareholders of a company. Story continues The cryptocurrency has struggled, however, with its value down about 95% since its launch. But Suarez remains highly involved in the industry and has argued that the country needs a president who understands the technologies around crypto and artificial intelligence.

In his recent YouTube video on his CapitalClubCommunity challenge, he said that most people focus on the output – how to make $1 million – rather than the input, which is what they can control. The question to ask, he said, is, “How can you, today, pick up a d*** book that teaches you what the history of money is? This thing you’re pursuing, you don’t even know what it is.”
On his website, Belmar recommended several titles worth reading, ranging from Sun Tzu’s Art of War to The Millionaire Master Plan by Roger James Hamilton and even “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” by Satoshi Nakamoto. This white paper introduced cryptocurrency to the world.

Touting the advantages of investing, he said in the video, “You think I’m going to work a decade hustling, thinking I’m productive, for 1.2 million when I can make that in a trade by understanding how the world works?”He advised business owners he called “hustlers,” who find themselves not running their business but letting their business run them. “Most people will spend the money they make during their hustle period… on themselves, trying to act and pretend that their bosses.”
Belmar said, “The boss reinvests that hustle money into the business to create sustainability. And then, in the sustainability, there is where you splurge… Stop being a hustler, start being a boss.”
At this point in the video, Belmar has started to sound like another well-known financial guru and YouTube personality, Jaspreet Singh. On his channel, Minority Mindset, Sing often advises people to put off purchases like designer clothes and fancy cars so they can invest a portion of their income. Once their money works for them, they can use that passive income to treat themselves.
Belmar broke it down by the numbers for viewers. He explained that a business earning $20,000 in net profit may have $10,000 left after taxes and expenses. “What’s that after a decade?” he asked viewers. “$1.2 million.”
On the other hand, if you invest that money, you can reap the rewards of passive income that is exponentially greater. “By understanding how the market flows, the ebbs and flows of currencies, the new currencies that are popping up, I’m positioning myself for a $100 million payout, not a $1.2 million payout over ten years,” Belmar said.
Belmar, who eats a primarily carnivore diet, abstains from alcohol and works out “moderately,” according to his website, also emphasized other aspects of life that are more important than money. “Your happiness can’t be attached to a number because as soon as you achieve it, you will want more… There is no amount of money that you can put into good health, good relationships, and peace of mind and peace of heart. It can’t be bought. It can’t be sold. It’s in the balance where you find purpose, tranquility, and peace.”

44387,2021-08-04 08:36:59,Bitcoin hits one-week low as SEC calls for more power over crypto,"The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued to slide on Wednesday as investors and traders fretted over the possibility of stricter cryptocurrency regulation.
Bitcoin was down 2% to $37,806 ($27,121) by 9am in London on Wednesday. The world's biggest cryptocurrency was trading at its lowest level in just over a week, extending a slump that began late on Sunday.
Price pressure comes asregulatory scrutiny on the sector continues to mount. New US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler told Bloomberg in an interview published on Tuesday that consumer protection in crypto was one of his key priorities.
In a speech delivered later that day,Gensler went further and called for additional powers to regulate the sector.
""We need additional congressional authorities to prevent transactions, products and platforms from falling between regulatory cracks,"" he said ""We also need more resources to protect investors in this growing and volatile sector.”

Mati Greenspan, the founder of Quantum Economics, said: ""What I thought was unfortunate was the way Gensler seems to want to stick with former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton's way of doing things.
""Rather than try and define new rules of the road, he seems quite content with the old Howey Test, which he praised.""
The Howey Test refers to a decades old Supreme Court ruling on the definition of an investment contract. The Supreme Court ruled that a contract exists""when there is the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others"".
""In truth, those laws probably were pretty good for business in the 1940s, but it would probably be a lot better for today's businesses if crypto entrepreneurs had a better understanding of what's allowed and what's not,"" Greenspan said.

28555,2019-09-03 16:47:40,Hedera Hashgraph says Mainnet Open Access will launch September,"Enterprise blockchain projectHedera Hashgraphannounced today that its mainnet beta will be open to the public on September 16, meaning that any developer can start buildingdAppson its platform.
“With Open Access, we are excited to welcome any and all to join the hundreds of third-party developers already building distributed applications on our platform,” Mance Harmon, Co-Founder, and CEO ofHedera Hashgraph, said in the press release.
Developers will also be able to run mirror nodes, which provide a public record of all consensus decisions made on the ledger.
WhereasBitcoinandEthereumcan only process 3-15 transactions each second—and it can take up to an hour to confirm those transactions—Hedera’s open access beta will allow for up to 10,000 transactions each second, and promises to cut down confirmation time to just a couple of seconds, too. The launch will also offer 10 smart contract and file transfers a second, and Hedera says it’ll increase speeds throughout the rest of the year.
Hedera Hashgraph, aproof-of-stakenetwork, owes its speed to an innovative blockchain structure called a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that promises super speedy transaction speeds (a fuller explanation of how it works can befound here). It’s incredibly cheap, too, transactions cost just US$0.0001.
Big corporations like IBM, Japanese investment bank Nomura, and telecoms giant TATA Communications have all started playing around with the technology.
The announcement also marks the start of Hedera’s 15-year coin distribution plan. Hedera raised $124 million in 2018 for Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs) offerings, and coins—”Hbars”—will be now slowly distributed to investors.
Hedera says it’s distributing the coins over such a long period to make sure the network stays secure. Right now, Hedera is a public permissioned network—meaning only some people are allowed to run nodes, maintain the network and manage consensus. Hedera thinks that relinquishing control over time—making Hedera a publicpermissionlessnetwork—will stop neer-do-wells from immediately cornering the market and monopolizing the ownership of nodes.
“The creation of the trust layer of the internet requires a measured, long-term rollout with responsible stewards, empowered individuals, and a slow token distribution,” Leemon Baird, Co-Founder and Chief Scientist of Hedera Hashgraph, said in the press release.",10660.0,0.05,10654.94,0.01,10644.42,-0.09,10615.13,-0.37,10654.21
58082,2021-11-17 18:37:21,Pros and Cons of Getting Paid in Bitcoin,"Getting Paid in Bitcoin El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021, only months after China outlawed mining of the digital currency, neatly captures the controversy and conflict excited by cryptocurrency. Businesses and people considering accepting Bitcoin as payment for goods and services can evaluate the decision by balancing the currency’s benefits in speed and freedom from fees and regulation against its volatility, complex tax picture, complex history and uncertain future. You might find it helpful to consult a financial advisor before you agree to accept Bitcoin as compensation. The Basics of Bitcoin Bitcoin is the world’s first cryptocurrency . The idea of a currency created using cryptography rather than through the mechanism of a central bank goes back to 1998. In 2009, Bitcoin was introduced by a still-mysterious person who went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Thousands of cryptocurrencies have since been devised, but Bitcoin still ranks as most popular and expensive. Cryptocurrency, also called digital currency, uses digital tokens stored in a widely distributed database that employs secure blockchain coding to record the token’s ownership and transaction history. Unlike currencies created by central banks that get their value from the guarantee of the government banking system, Bitcoin has no intrinsic worth and are valued only by supply and demand. Therefore, the value of a token can vary widely over a short period of time, meaning the extraordinary volatility of Bitcoin on digital currency exchanges represents one of its most distinct qualities. When first issued in 2009, each bitcoin token had no market, and, in turn, no value. Within a couple of years, a token was trading for $1. In April 2021, a single bitcoin was trading for over $63,000. However, within weeks, the value of the tokens had fallen by more than 50%. Despite the difficulty of predicting Bitcoin’s value, businesses are increasingly accepting it. In September 2021, Coinmap reported that more than 23,000 establishments worldwide took the cryptocurrency in exchange for a wide variety of goods and services. Story continues Laws in the U.S. and elsewhere require employers to pay wages in legal currency. That makes using it to meet payroll problematic, if not actually illegal. However, independent contractors and freelancers are reportedly embracing the tokens as suitable payment for their services. Getting paid in Bitcoin, requires setting up a free account on a digital currency exchange, such as Coinbase. Recipients of crypto payments can then store their bitcoins in digital wallets . They can sell their tokens on the digital currency exchange for legal tender. What Are the Pros of Receiving Bitcoin as Compensation? Getting Paid in Bitcoin Bitcoin transactions occur instantly, with tokens showing up as owned by the seller of a good or service as soon as the deal is complete. Cryptocurrencies also exist outside the regular banking system. Therefore, there are no exchange fees, credit fees or other costs associated with a Bitcoin transaction. So the speed, certainty and low cost of Bitcoin transactions can make them attractive for doing international business. The volatility of Bitcoin tokens can be considered a benefit, as well as a potential drawback. For anyone who thinks bitcoins are going up in value, accepting them in payment is a way to invest in an asset with potential for rapid price gains. The risk of getting paid in Bitcoin can, to some extent, be managed. One way to mitigate the volatility risk is to receive part payment in cryptocurrency, and the rest in legal tender. Bitcoin recipients could also choose to sell some or all of their digital tokens immediately, locking in the current value. This is as opposed to holding the cryptocurrency and accepting the possibility that it could be worth much less in the future. With all its problems and promise, Bitcoin has an undeniable high profile and a distinctly trendy aura. Businesses and individuals can distinguish themselves by announcing that they accept Bitcoin. Similarly, offering to pay employees with Bitcoin may be a way to attract future-thinking workers. What Are the Cons of Getting Paid in Bitcoin? Volatility may be the main drawback to accepting Bitcoin for payment. A business or individual could lose a substantial portion of their payment in days or even hours if the value of the currency suddenly drops. Another limitation is that most vendors do not accept digital currency as payment. So anyone accepting Bitcoins has to sell the tokens, turning them into legal tender such as U.S. dollars, in order to use them to pay bills. Additionally, Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. When a bitcoin is accepted as payment, there’s no way to undo the deal. Credit card companies can’t charge back vendors who are paid in bitcoins, for instance, and refunds are strictly at the option of the seller. As shown by the contrast between El Salvador and China, the regulatory environment around Bitcoin is both complex and evolving. Regulators in the U.S. have adopted a fairly loose approach to crypto, but there’s no guarantee this will continue. Anyone who builds up a pile of bitcoins faces the possibility that negative rule changes could have a disastrous effect on the token’s value. Each country also taxes Bitcoin in widely different ways. The IRS taxes Bitcoin as property rather than income. So an American bitcoin owner who sells tokens for a value higher than when they were acquired will owe taxes at either regular income tax rates or capital gains rates. Which one you pay depends on how long the tokens were held. Bitcoin transactions are also completely anonymous. While this might seem like a benefit of Bitcoin, it’s actually a main reason they have been a preferred method of receiving payment by scammers, hackers and purveyors of illegal offerings. These include the notorious Silk Road, an online black market for banned drugs. Although Silk Road was eventually shut down, with regulators later confiscating a reported $1 billion in Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency world remains rife with scammers and hackers and Bitcoin retains an association of illegitimacy. Bottom Line Getting Paid in Bitcoin Bitcoin is the leading example of cryptocurrency and is increasingly accepted by individuals and businesses as payment for goods and services. The speed and freedom from fees Bitcoin transactions offer make it appealing to people doing business internationally. However, the cryptocurrency’s volatility and shifting regulatory environment mean it is much riskier to accept it compared to legal tender currencies. Cryptocurrency Tips Cryptocurrency is one of the riskiest assets anyone can hold these days. Before considering buying, selling or accepting Bitcoin or another digital currency as pay, consulting with a financial advisor could be helpful. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard.

83563,2024-07-15 15:53:02,Goldman Sachs CEO is first bank leader to speak publicly on Trump shooting: America ‘cannot afford’ division and distrust,"American banks are busy this week reporting earnings for the first half of 2024. While many of the nation’s largest banks, including JP Morgan,Wells Fargo, andCitigroupshared their results on Friday,Goldman Sachswas the first to report following the assassination attempt on former U.S. President Donald Trump over the weekend.
Kicking off an earnings call where he announced growth in Goldman's global banking and markets and asset wealth management sections, CEO David Solomon told investors he was grateful the former President was safe and offered condolences to the families of those who were killed, calling the assassination attempt a sad moment for our country.
“We cannot afford division and distrust to get the better of us,"" said Solomon. ""I truly hope this is a moment that will spur reflection and action, that celebrate what unites us as citizens and as a society.""
Following the attempted assassination, the markets are showing similar resilience that they did in the aftermath of the 1981 attempted assassination of former President Ronald Reagan. As the first day of trading since the attempted assassination of Trump kicked off U.S. treasuries and the S&P 500 Index fell only slightly, while bitcoin increased more than it has since last month.
The assassination attempt on Trump occurred Saturday, July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania when a gunman fired multiple shots, hitting Donald Trump in the right ear, killing one and injuring two others. The gunman was shot and killed at the scene. The attack bears a striking similarly to the March 1981 attempt on former President Ronald Reagan, which is credited with helpingcementhim as a “mythic figure."" In the aftermath of the attempt on Reagan's life, the S&P 500 remained stable at about $469, before falling to $366 the following May, according to data from Macrotrends, and kicking off a bull market that lasted until the dot-com bubble nearly twenty years later.
The so-called ""Trump trade"" based on expectations of Republican dominance as a result of the failed assassination attempt is already gaining momentum, according to aFortunereportthis weekend. The yield on 2-year treasury bonds fell the most to 4.46% as of 10:25am ET. Three months treasury yield fell to 5.33% while 30-year yields increased to 4.46%. Bitcoin is up 3.59% today to 62,989.
During the Goldman Sachs investor call this morning, David Solomon went onto relate that the bank produced a 10.9% return on equity for the second quarter and a 12.8% return on equity for the first half of the year. Yesterday, JP Morgan’s CEO Jaime Dimon sent an email to employees seen byFortuneexpressing condolences and well wishes, calling for a “constructive dialogue” to tackle the nation's challenges.
“We must all stand firmly together against any acts of hate, intimidation or violence that seek to undermine our democracy or inflict harm,” he wrote. On Friday JP Morgan published its second quarter results, showing a return on equity of 23%, up from a ROE of 17% last quarter.
The statements from David Solomon and Jamie Dimon follow on a separatestatementon Saturday, the day of the attempt from the Business Roundtable, a non-profit lobbying association of which both executives are members calling on Americans to “reject political violence and to commit to resolving political differences peacefully.""
Other American banking leaders who are members of the Roundtable includeBank of AmericaCEO Brian Moynihan, Citgroup CEO Jane Fraser,BNY MellonCEO Robin Vince,State StreetCEO Ronald O’Hanley, U.S. Bank CEO Andrew Cecere, and Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf.
On Friday, Well Fargo’s shared its ROE of 11.5%, and Citi shared an ROE of 6.3%. Bank of America and State Street are both scheduled to share earnings calls on July 16, while U.S. Bank’s investor call is scheduled for July 17.

Investors Buoyed by Regulators' Statement Send Cryptos Higher
After a nerve-wracking Thursday and Friday, crypto investors took heart over the weekend from a decision by Federal regulators to restore all deposits at failed Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB) in full and an announcement by fintech Circle to cover any of its stablecoin USDC reserves.
Bitcoin was recently trading at $22,482, up more than 9.3% over the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency had plunged below $20,000 early Friday (UTC) as SIVB customers withdrew their money en masse, spurring the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation to shutter the institution, a central player in the world's technology sector. SIVB's failure is the second largest in U.S. history.
In a joint statement on Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell, and FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg,said thatafter weighing FDIC and Federal Reserve recommendations and consulting with U.S. President Joe Biden, Yellen had ""approved actions enabling the FDIC to complete actions in a manner that fully protects all depositors"" at SIVB.
“Today we are taking decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy by strengthening public confidence in our banking system,” the statement read.
Mark Connors, head of research at crypto asset manager 3iQ, called the agencies' action ""risk asset friendly at first blush"" in a weekly report, although he noted warily, ""Too many moving parts and M2 [monetary aggregate of currency and coins, savings deposits and shares in mutual money market funds] STILL contracting.""
But Connors also added: ""The Fed continues to extend their control on markets. What they announced this evening is the equivalent of guaranteeing overnight bank deposits in 2008.""
Ether also regained ground to change hands at $1,614, up 9.6% from Saturday, same time. Other major cryptocurrencies that were hard-stricken last week as the impact on the crypto industry from SIVB's collapse became apparent also rebounded over the weekend, with their main surge coming on Sunday. APT, the token of layer 1 protocol Aptos, and ADA, the native crypto of Ethereum rival Cardano were up more than 13% and 11%, respectively. TheCoinDesk Market Index, a measure of overall market performance, was down almost 10%.
On Saturday, payments technology company Circle Internet Financial said itwould “cover any shortfall”in the assets backing its stablecoin USDC in the event it does not receive the entirety of a $3.3 billion cash reserve it was holding at Silicon Valley Bank. In ablog post, Circle said it “will stand behind USDC and cover any shortfall using corporate resources, involving external capital if necessary.” The value of the stablecoin fell as low as $0.88 before the announcement, but was currently trading above $.99 cents.
U.S. stocks were swept up in banking sector worries with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 declining 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. The S&P finished down 5% for the week, its worst weekly performance since September 2022. As trading opened in Asia, the Nikkei 225 and Taiwan TSEC 50 Index were down slightly.
3iQ's Connors wrote that long-term the regulatory action to safeguard customers' assets would continue a ""game of regulatory whack-a-mole"" leading to, among other affects, a continued consolidation of the banking industry and the acceleration of stablecoin regulation.
""Outcome TBD,"" Connors wrote.

SIVB Collapse Shows Why Small Banks Are Vulnerable
Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB)has been shuttered by state regulators.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is racing to ensure that as much money as possible is available to SIVB clientswhen the market opens Monday.
Late last week, Silvergate Bank, a major fiat on and off-ramp for the crypto market, announced it wasengaging in voluntary liquidationand shutting down, creating market panic. Its chief competitor, Signature,was seizedby regulators over the weekend.
While SIVB serviced some crypto companies, it didn’t service exchanges like Silvergate or Signature.
The Federal Reserve definesSIVB as a large bank (these institutions have over $50 billion in deposits), and Silvergate as a small bank. Some have said should the FDIC not act decisively on Monday contagion will spread throughout the broader banking sector. Already,runs are beginningonFirst Republic Bankand other regional players.
Fundamentally, this crisis isn’t about crypto. The performance of tech companies – considered a risky asset – in a high-interest rate environment played a part, but it wasn’t everything either.
It’s about how small banks fared during stimulus-heavy Covid. These small banks aren’t as well known as SIVB, but like Silvergate, specialize in serving an industry or niche.
They are also the ones that power fintechs. Cross River Bank (assets $9.9 billion) is thefinancial plumbingbehind Coinbase, Stripe and Affirm. Evolve Bank & Trust (assets $1.3 billion)is the bank behindWise and Dave.
These small banks like the arrangement because it diversifies their client base away from the usual local businesses that bank with small, regional institutions.
Tech startups, which move fast and break things, prefer to usesmall banks rather than traditional big banks. There’s a belief that they understand each other, and would get a more personalized, attentive experience rather than having an account with one of America’s largest banks. But in turn, this means that these small banks – which power fintechs – are overly exposed to the tech sector.
Covid, the curve, and small banks
In 2020, small banks saw a massive influx of cash assets onto their balance sheetspartly because of fiscal stimulusand the Fed’s asset purchases, which usually are geared toward an industry niche. As Covid’s impact on the economy wore off, cash supply turned into loans, and since September 2021, the growth in cash assets on small bank balance sheets has turned negative.
Throughout 2022, small bank lending increased while growth in cash assets stayed negative.
“Banks are now sitting with reserves pretty much at their lowest comfort level — especially small banks,” TS Lombard economist Steven Blitzwrote in a February note. “[Small banks] are more aggressive in lending and in borrowing short-term liabilities to fund themselves.”
Given the size of these institutions, and the lack of cash on hand compared to larger banks, Blitz writes that their borrowing was more aggressive. In addition, their small size meant they didn’t have the same level of regulation as their larger counterparts.
Fitz explains that post-Covid borrowings included advances fromFederal Home Loan Banks(FHLBs),designedtoprovide stop-gap liquidity, or from theFed’s discount window, usually reserved for emergencies.
“Small banks, many of which are private and therefore have no shareholder concerns regarding the optics of borrowing from the discount window, have consequently shifted to using the Fed’s discount window facility,” Blitz wrote.
Both Silvergate and SIVB had large advances from FHLBs on the balance sheet.
In the case of Silvergate, it ended 2022 with $4.3 billion of FHLB money on the balance sheet. This figure increased dramatically from the $700 million it had at the end of September 2022 because it needed tosupport its cash positionin the face of rapid withdrawals post-FTX collapse. Days before its collapse,it said the loans were fully repaid– further depleting its balance sheet.
Withstanding spikes in the cost of borrowing
Lending long and borrowing short has been the model for banks since the beginning of time, but an inverted yield curve contradicts this.
An inverted yield curve occurs when short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates – an anomaly, as lending money for the long-term should fetch a higher interest rate for the lender.
At press time, the two-year Treasury note yielded a whole percentage point more than the 10-year note. The two-year yield has increased by 300 basis points to 4.82% in 12 months.
The dramatic increase in the cost of borrowing for these banks makes their lives difficult, coupled with a very tech-specific deposit flight as investors prefer high-yield short-term bonds over risky tech and crypto.
Startups aren’t raising new money given this environment and burning what they have to stay afloat.
Silicon Valley Bank identified this as a problem in its Q1-23 mid-quarter update.
FRED data shows the same is happening at these small banks that power startup-friendly fintechs.
What’s going to happen if a deal to save SVIB, the mothership of tech startup finance doesn’t come to fruition? Or, if depositors only get 40-50% of their money back? It’s going to be a tech deep-freeze. Beware small banks.
“The gov’t has about 48 hours to fix a soon-to-be-irreversible mistake,” Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackmantweeted on the weekend. “These withdrawals will drain liquidity from community, regional and other banks and begin the destruction of these important institutions.”
“Already thousands of the fastest growing, most innovative venture-backed companies in the U.S. will begin to fail to make payroll next week,” he continued.

72503,2024-11-13 13:08:00,This Potential Announcement Could Be the Next Big Move for Bitcoin,"Once dismissed as an internet oddity,Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC)has evolved into a major asset class, recently surpassing the market cap of silver. With itsunique properties(a finite supply and highly decentralized and secure network), the cryptocurrency is turning even its greatest skeptics into believers.
Now, as Bitcoin gains wider acceptance, a bold idea is emerging: Could the U.S. government start stockpiling Bitcoin? While this may seem far-fetched, the concept of a U.S. Bitcoin reserve is gaining traction and could potentially ignite a race among nations to accumulate the world's original and most valuable cryptocurrency.

Imagine telling someone in 2009, when Bitcoin first emerged, that this digital currency would one day be integral to a national strategy. It might have sounded like science fiction, but this concept entered mainstream politics in 2021 when Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, an outspoken Bitcoin advocate, proposed that Bitcoin could bolster the weakening U.S. dollar.
Since then, Lummis has expanded on this idea, suggesting that a national Bitcoin reserve could benefit the United States in multiple ways. Not only could a Bitcoin stockpile help offset some of the national debt, but it could also position the U.S. advantageously if Bitcoin's value continues to rise and other nations begin to acquire it.
What once seemed improbable has gained traction over the past year as more political figures have embraced the idea. At the recent Bitcoin conference in Nashville, prominent speakers, including former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and President-elect Donald Trump, voiced their support for a U.S. Bitcoin reserve. With Trump's victory in the election, the political momentum behind this initiative has intensified, and Lummis recently posted on X, confirming that a national Bitcoin reserve might be in the works.
The idea of a government stockpiling Bitcoin may still seem unlikely to some, but it aligns with a powerful concept in economics known asgame theory. If the United States were to begin accumulating Bitcoin, it would likely set off a domino effect, pressuring other nations to follow suit to avoid falling behind. In game theory terms, this is a classic example of ""prisoner's dilemma,"" where each player (or country, in this case) is incentivized to act to avoid the risk of losing a strategic advantage.
Some smaller nations, like El Salvador and Bahrain, have already added Bitcoin to their reserves, but if the U.S. were to endorse Bitcoin as a strategic asset, it could accelerate this trend significantly. With the endorsement of the world's most powerful economy, Bitcoin could go from niche asset to essential reserve.
If the United States were to initiate a Bitcoin reserve, it wouldn't just be a statement about the government's perspective on digital assets, it could potentially ignite an arms race among nations. Governments have vast financial resources at their disposal, and if they start to view Bitcoin as essential, this could be the rocket fuel that propels Bitcoin's value into the stratosphere.
Countries competing to secure as much Bitcoin as possible would introduce unprecedented demand, pushing prices up rapidly and potentially transforming Bitcoin into one of the most coveted assets worldwide.
While Bitcoin's adoption at the government level is still in its infancy, the progression of this idea from niche to mainstream shows how rapidly the landscape is evolving. The simple fact that it is even being discussed provides a glimpse into the signs of the times and what may be in store for the world's original cryptocurrency.
Only time will tell, but remember, this is Bitcoin. Stranger things have happened.

14066,2021-02-22 23:00:30,How Biden and the Democrats can win back working-class Americans,"President Biden should prioritize structurally upgrading both the woeful U.S. political and economic systems. If he succeeds, those upgrades will yield political dividends in 2022.
The Democratic Party is a tarred brand. In swing suburbs won by President Biden in last November’s elections, other Democratstrailed down-ballot, with the party losing 13 House seats. Tellingly, independent voters thoughtmore of Biden than they did of other Democrats.
Without Trump on the ballot in 2024, Democrats face a fraught task retaining the presidency because of the antidemocratic Electoral College. While he won the popular vote by 7.1 million, Biden’s actual margin, for purposes of winning the Electoral College, was a scant65,000 votes, his edge in Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, and Nebraska’s second district. Put another way: Against a deeply flawed opponent in a nation beset by epic economic, health, and social crises, Biden won by fewer votes than Trump’s 2016 winning margin of 78,000 votes.
There are at least three major structural challenges that Biden’s agenda must address.
Junking the filibuster.Should even one Democratic senator defect to support Republicans in preserving the filibuster, Biden’s agenda will be stillborn, a disaster for the Democrats. That would be a replay of 2009–10 when a handful of Democrats defected, colluding with filibustering Republicans to kill400 lawsenacted by House Democrats that would have embodied President Obama’s agenda.
Addressing a flawed democracy.U.S. elections have beenranked the worstamong rich democracies by the Election Integrity Project. Absent a filibuster, Biden will shortly enact upgrades to voting rights and publicly funded campaigns, while limiting gerrymandering and pay-to-play. His agenda must also include 2021statehoodforPuerto Ricoand Washington, D.C.
Fixing a flawed capitalism.Compared with other rich democracies, the U.S. pointlessly rewards capital at the expense of work. The mechanism for doing so: corporate boards of directors that prioritize rewards to shareholders at the expense of local communities and employees. It’s an anachronistic variant of capitalism abandoned by other rich democracies during the past half-century; those companies have upgraded by adding employees to boards, ina process calledcodetermination.
Correcting structural deficiencies in U.S. elections and corporate governance will enhance the quality of American life—and also benefit the Democratic Party in crucial swing states. Electoral College calculus demands that Democrats make inroads with swing-state Trump voters. Many told exitpollstersthat the economy/jobs was their singlemost important issue. Some 35% of all voters named the economy as their top reason for selecting a candidate, for instance, and83% of themvoted for Trump—even higher numbers in swing states likeArizona.
Trump benefited from a tight labor market pre-COVID that pulled noncollege voters from economic purgatory into the mainstream. He prevailed67% to 32% among non–college-educated whites, for instance, improving significantly over 2016 in counties where incomes wereat the national median or less. Real incomes of lower-income households rose at the fastest rate in 50 years under Trump. Indeed, the 11% rise in incomes during 2017–19 under Trump for the poorest quintile of American households was a sharp reversal of their dismal experience under Democrats: For five years under Obama, the real household incomes of the poorest Americans were actually lower than in 1973, when adjusted for inflation. Moreover, the gains for the second and middle quintiles under Trump were twice that during the entire eight years of Obama’s presidency.
Biden needs to demonstrate that Democrats have changed, and now take the economicplightof non–college-educated Americans seriously. His $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan (which includes child benefits and a higher minimum wage) helpfully tackles COVID-19 and economic recovery. But to flip non–college-educated voters, Biden must also acknowledge their frustrations—especially their justified resentment of disrespecting elites atop corporations who profit by predatorily outsourcing and exporting their jobs. Their condescension is why 64% of Americans are so fearful of joboffshoring.
Majority Leader CharlesSchumerand 13 fellowSenate Democratswant employee representatives to sit on U.S. corporate boards, just as they do now at world-class enterprises like [hotlink]Adidas[/hotlink],Bayer, andDaimler. Peer-reviewed analysesaffirmthat codetermination benefits employees and corporate investment as well as shareholders. Itconvertscorporations from predators to advocates for workers and communities, eliminatingjob offshoring. Thatoccursbecause codetermination boardsupgradetheir product mix in order to export products, not jobs. They reach deep into ranks of the non–college-educated, drawing them into the economic mainstream.
That’s why European workforceskill levelsare higher, while their share of low-wage jobs is smaller. More non–college-educated workers in Northern Europe have jobs (70% in the U.S. versus 82% in Germany, for example), and they earnmorethan their American counterparts.
Codetermination is the only seasoned option open to Democrats eager to systemically reintegrate noncollege Americans into the mainstream U.S. economy. President Biden has that opportunity owing to the remarkable mobilization of voters (think Georgia) inspired by his campaign’scommitmentto working-class Americans. His opportunity is fleeting, however. He has a 22-month window before midterm elections—too short for half-measures.
Biden should seize the opportunity to achieve a historic upgrade of American capitalism.

30935,2022-05-24 15:49:07,"In Cuba, caution and confusion meet eased US sanctions","HAVANA (AP)  Marylín Álvarez seemed to be just the sort of person that eased American sanctions on Cuba were meant to help. With the aid of money sent by a cousin living in the United States, she began transforming the entrance to her ground-floor apartment into a tiny cafe about four years ago. It was one of myriad small private businesses blossoming on the Communist-led island as U.S. President Barack Obama's opening to Cuba led to more money and visitors from the north. She bought a freezer, a juicer and some cups. She installed a new water faucet and was about to add a sink to go with it, as well as chairs and ingredients for the food she was going to sell at her doorway in Havana. And then it all fell apart. Former President Donald Trump tightened the six-decade-old embargo of Cuba and sharply restricted money transfers to Cuba in late 2020, shutting down the system that made them relatively easy: Western Union transfers to a government-owned Cuban exchange house. Álvarez abandoned her application for a small business license. Now the administration of new President Joe Biden is once again making it legal for Americans to send larger amounts of money to Cuba, saying it hopes to stimulate private enterprise there. But so much has changed over the past two years that Álvarez is wary of reviving her plans  an example of the caution with which many Cubans are greeting the new measures and confusion about how they may work. Cuba's economy has been devastated by the loss of tourism caused by the pandemic and by Trump's tougher sanctions. Fewer people would have money to buy the coffee and snacks Álvarez hoped to sell. The government's lack of hard currency has hit imports, so it's extremely difficult to get reliable supplies of the flour, coffee and cheese Álvarez would need for her products  and prices for those scarce goods have been soaring. That crisis also collided with the local government's effort to fix deep-rooted problems by eliminating an old two-currency system while raising pay and prices last year. That coincided with the emergence of a black market for foreign currencies and sharply added to inflation. While the new peso is supposed to be valued at 24 per dollar, people on the street sometimes offer 100. Story continues You earn very little with this. It doesn't give me enough to make an investment,"" said Álvarez, who has turned to a less costly form of making money for her family  giving manicures. There are no official figures on how much money family and friends abroad send to Cubans, but the Miami-based Havana Consulting Group estimated it reached $3.7 billion in 2019  with a similar value arriving in the luggage of visitors bringing food, household supplies, small appliances, tires and the like. About 400,000 Cuban-Americans visited the island in 2018 and more than 500,000 in 2019. In addition, a half million other U.S. visitors came in 2018. By 2021, remittances had fallen to about $1 billion, the Consulting Group calculated, and overall U.S. visitors dropped to just 60,000, according to government figures  partly due to Trump's tighter restrictions on travel but even more to the pandemic shutting off flights. The impact of remittances far predates Obama, however. Cuban economist Pavel Vidal of Javerian Pontifical University in Cali, Colombia, said they averaged about $2.1 billion over he whole period from 2005 to 2020. Much arrived in the wallets and handbags of travelers. But for years, Cuban-Americans also could send Western Union transfers to relatives on the island. That ended in November 2020 when U.S. officials barred dealings with a Cuban government agency, Fincimex, that distributed those transfers at hundreds of branches across the island. The Biden opening removes many limits on transfers  but didn't specify how they can be made. The old Western Union method through official channels may have been made obsolete in the meantime anyway due to Cuba's new single currency. With the street value of those pesos only a quarter of the official rate, few people would want to trade dollars for pesos at a state-run exchange house. So Cubans are finding other ways. The flow of remittances never ceased to arrive. The Cuban, with his creativity, has invented excellent mechanisms"" to send money, said Erich García, a 35-year-old programmer and specialist in cryptocurrencies. Some people have used those virtual currencies like Bitcoin to shift money to Cubans electronically. Garcia estimated that about 100,000 have cryptocurrency accounts. But those, too, have complexities and drawbacks. Commonly used cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have lost more than half their dollar value since November. Visitors to the island sometimes bring in dollars for their own relatives, or those of friends. Some do it for those they barely know, and charge a commission. Others send in packages of food and personal care products, and recipients trade what they don't need to neighbors. Some websites even let people pay Cuban cellphone bills from abroad  credits that Cuban recipients sometimes trade. We have to wait to see what solutions are offered by these measures,"" Garcia said. During his campaign, Biden promised to undo many of the new restrictions Trump had imposed, though the tough Cuban government crackdown on an outburst of protests last year may have made that politically impossible for Washington. Still, the measures announced this month, in addition to relaxing limits on transfers, also call for resuming the processing of visas for Cubans in Havana, as well as a family reunification program to let some people on the island join relatives in the U.S. The measures that President Biden has taken are going to have a not-insignificant impact in the short and above all in the medium term,"" said economist Arturo López-Levy, a professor of international relations at Holy Names University in Oakland, California, ""Given the precarious situation of the Cuban economy, that should be considered a space for relief. ___ Andrea Rodríguez is on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ARodriguezAP",29472.2,0.01,29454.78,-0.05,29451.0,-0.06,29327.17,-0.48,29469.98
2671,2019-05-24 17:08:32,Former hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz says America needs redistribution of wealth,"• Former Goldman Sachs macro trader and Fortress hedge-fund manager is the latest to point out problems with modern-day capitalism and income inequality.
• Novogratz, who pivoted to start a cryptocurrency merchant bank and is famously bullish on bitcoin, floated the idea of a “Wall Street tax.”
• “You need redistribution of wealth, there are lot of different ways you can do that,’ Novogratz says, calling a transaction tax an “interesting” but controversial one.
Macro trader turned bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz is calling for fixes to capitalism — and a possible tax on Wall Street.
The former Fortress hedge-fund manager pointed to a rising income gap and lack of investment in public education in the United States. One place to start could be a ""controversial"" Wall Street transaction tax, which would also extend to cryptocurrency trades.
""I think you need redistribution of wealth, there are lot of different ways you can do that,"" Novogratz told CNBC's "" Squawk Box "" Friday. ""I think a Wall Street tax is an interesting one.""
Novogratz is hardly alone in critiquing the current economic system. Warren Buffett, Jamie Dimon, Ray Dalio, Howard Schultz and other business leaders have called for fixes to a widening income gap and under-investment in public education.
The inequality between rich and poor Americans is as high as it was in late 1930s, hedge fund titan Ray Dalio pointed out in a paper posted online in April. The wealth of the top 1 percent of the population is now more than that of the bottom 90 percent of the population combined. Dalio has called growing inequality and lack of investment in public education ""an existential risk for the U.S.""
Novogratz pointed to American economist Milton Friedman — a champion of free-market capitalism — who Novogratz said was writing at a time when there was a high marginal tax rate and workers had a bigger share of income and profits.
""If Milton saw where things have gone today, he would have a different view,"" Novogratz said.

The world's largest cryptocurrency was trading just above $8,000 Friday, more than doubling in value since January. While it hasn't recovered anywhere near its all-time high, bitcoin has won out as the the digital version of gold and a store of value, Novogratz said in the ""Squawk Box"" interview.
""Bitcoin is not going to be a payment currency — it's going to be just like gold,"" he said. ""It won that lane.""

A positive start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash move through to an intraday high $908.2 in the early hours, falling short of the first major resistance level at $912.93, before reversing through the remainder of the day, an intraday low $866.1 managing to hold above the first major support level at $865.33 before recovering to $870 levels by the day’s end.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash was down 5.88% with the bears taking over through the morning, as news of the South Korean government launching investigations into the recent hacks handed the reins over to the bears.
The day started on a bad note, with Bitcoin Cash falling from an early $875.3 high through the first major support level at $856.8 to $841, testing the second support level at $840.4 before a second sell-off saw Bitcoin Cash slide through the second major support level to a fresh morning low $815.
For the day ahead it could be a messy one should Bitcoin Cash fail to recovery through the second major support level at $840.4 to avoid more heavy losses, with a pullback through the 13thJune’s swing lo $800.9 on the cards later in the day should Bitcoin Cash move sideways through the middle part of the day.
It’s a big reaction to the news wires and, while it’s going to be red for the day, we will expect some support to kick in at current levels.

Litecoin fell by a further 1.16% on Thursday, following Wednesday’s 0.78% decline, to end the day at $96.7, the fall marking a 3rdconsecutive day in the red for the current week.
Following the broader market, Litecoin moved through to a morning $99.17 high to come within range of the first major resistance level at $99.38 before reversing through the remainder of the day, an intraday low $96.15 steering clear of the first major support level at $95.89.
At the time of writing, Litecoin was down 6.43% to $90.47, with a broad based market sell-off dragging Litecoin deep into the red, a start of the day $96.79 high leaving the first major resistance level at $98.53 untested before sliding through the three major support levels.
For the day ahead, a move through the third major support level at $91.3 to the second major support level at $94.43 would signal a possible recovery, though with the mass sell-off there could be more pain to come.
Failure to move back through the third and second major support levels would likely see Litecoin pullback to sub-$90 levels and strike a new swing lo in the process before any recovery.

For the day ahead, a move back through the second major support level to $0.52 levels would signal a possible rebound, though Ripple’s XRP will need to break out from the first major support level to $0.5366 to support a sustained recovery.
Failure to move back through to $0.52 levels could see Ripple’s XRP resume the sell-off, brining sub-$0.50 levels and a new swing lo into play later in the day.

• Consumer and producer prices rose more than expected in February, government data showed.
• Investors continued to dial back their expectations for Fed rate cuts in 2024.
US stocks fell on Friday as traders fretted over hot inflation data and continued to dial back their expectations for rate cuts in 2024. All three benchmark indexes ended the lower, while bond yields ticked slightly higher.
The S&P 500 ended with its second straight weekly loss.
Both consumer and producer prices came in hotter than expected this week, with the consumer price index rising 3.2% and the producer price index rising 1.6% year-per-year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.
Hot inflation is the Fed's main focus, and investors are growing concerned that central bankers could end up holding interest rates higher for a lot longer to keep prices from surging again, especially as the economy looks to be going strong.
""Inflation reports this week served as a reminder that normalization is not a straight line, and pressures remain in many pockets,"" Mark Hackett, Nationwide's chief of investment said in a note on Friday.
The Fed's next policy meeting is just around the corner, with central bankers set to begin the two-day policy meeting next Tuesday to decide the next policy move. Markets are pricing in a near-100% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged this month, according to theCME FedWatch tool.
Investors also continued to dial back their expectations for rate cuts for the rest of the year. Markets are now pricing just a 30% chance the Fed could slash rates by 100 basis points or more by December, down from a 64% probability priced in a month ago, and odds of a June rate cut have come down to about a coin-toss.

50483,2022-11-09 21:00:00,"MORNING BID-CPI catches the eye, crypto crumbles","By Jamie McGeever
Nov 10 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever. All eyes are turning to the latest U.S. inflation figures, but all tongues are wagging about the crash in crypto.
The October snapshot of U.S. consumer prices comes at a slightly more nervous juncture for markets than even a few days ago. Not only has the FTX collapse triggered turmoil across the crypto universe, Meta Inc. laying off 13% of its workforce has brought the tech and economic outlook back into sharp focus.
U.S. rates market have been comfortable pricing an implied terminal rate above 5%, to be reached some time in the middle of next year, for over a week. Sticky inflation could push these expectations even higher, but how much more will the Fed really tighten without slamming the economy?
Economists expect monthly and annual core readings to dip from September, and the headline annual rate to fall to 8.0% from 8.2%. That would be the lowest since February.
As terminal rate forecasts have plateaued since the turn of the month, Treasury yields have been pretty rangebound and the dollar has eased back from its recent 20-year peak. Perhaps macro traders are laying the ground for a move.
Meanwhile, there have been moves aplenty in other markets. Bitcoin sank 10% on Tuesday and 12% on Wednesday to a two-year low below $16,500. Thursday marks a year to the day since its all-time peak of $69,000. Not a particularly happy anniversary.
Could cratering crypto be spilling over to tech? The web of holdings and investments between crypto and tech is murky, but real.
Tesla shares sank to a two-year low on Wednesday, and Cathie Wood's ARKK Innovation ETF slumped to a five-year low - it is down 80% from its peak last year. Meta shares may have surged as investors cheered the 11,000 job cuts, but dismissals on that scale are a clear health warning for sector.
Markets may be getting twitchy. For the first time in a month, the VIX 'fear index' rose two days in a row.
Three key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Thursday:
U.S. inflation (October)

Several other planned deliveries from Cameron and Cheniere Energy Inc.’s Corpus Christi facility in Texas were also delayed, they said. The Freeport LNG terminal in Texas on Tuesday briefly brought down and restarted one of its three production units, according to a state regulatory filing. Freeport LNG’s loading schedule was also disrupted this week as a result of the weather, according to people familiar with the matter. Export disruptions will likely be short-lived, with warmer weather expected next week. Milder-than-normal temperatures are forecast across most of the US from Jan. 23 to 27, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The global market impact should also be limited given that gas inventories across Europe and Asia remain high, with the end of winter on the horizon. European gas futures fell to a five-month low on Wednesday. Frigid weather in the US closed ports and reduced domestic gas production, forcing LNG exporters to rearrange schedules for customers. Pipeline gas flows to liquefaction facilities on Wednesday were 45% lower than a week earlier. Cameron LNG did not respond for comment. A spokesperson declined to comment on the plant operations earlier this week. Spokespeople for Cheniere and Freeport also declined to comment.

Cryptos have been boosted by institutional support recently. Several organisations, including MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Tesla, have invested billions of dollars into cryptocurrencies and traditional financial firms like PayPal (PYPL) and Goldman Sachs (GS) started to handle the asset on behalf of clients.
Experts say the crypto craze fuelled interest in bitcoin miner Argo Blockchain (ARB.L). ""Argo Blockchain has seen a flurry of interest across social media which is likely to have help propel it into the top of the stocks for June,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
Despite the optimism, cryptos face staunch opposition from governments and central banks which have been keen to regulate digital currencies.
On Tuesday, the Bank of England (BoE) governor, Andrew Bailey, said digital currencies will not get a regulatory ""free pass"" in the future, despite their potential for innovation.
Speaking at TheCityUK's annual conference, Bailey said the bank needs to ""provide a lead in setting out the rules of the road"", noting that playing catchup on digital currencies is not a recipe for success.
Bailey doubled down on his earlier position that bitcoin is not money, and has no intrinsic value because it has no backing. He added that stablecoins have the potential to become systemic in terms of their importance in the financial system and its stability, and that UK authorities are already considering the regulatory approach for both systemic and non-systemic stablecoins.
The UK's Financial Conduct Authority previously warned that if consumers invest in cryptoassets ""they should be prepared to lose all their money"".
In May, Chinese vice-premier Liu Hu said China would ""severely crack down on illegal securities activities and severely punish illegal financial activities"".

To enjoy unlimited access to our journalism,subscribe today.Big banks have long held precious objects on behalf of their customers—from jewels in safe-deposit boxes to shares of stock. Now, thanks to a new policy by a federal banking regulator, they will be able to hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin too.The new policy is set out ina letterpublished on Wednesday by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The letter, addressed to an unnamed bank, stated that national banks and savings associations can engage in so-called custody services for their clients.
The news is significant because regulatory uncertainty has until now led major banks to avoid Bitcoin. What’s more, the bylaws of many big investment funds, including pension funds, oblige them to park clients’ money only with federally chartered banks. As the research group Coin Center notes, this amounts to a de facto ban on cryptocurrency.
The upshot is that big banks now have a green light to open crypto operations. If they do, they will likely begin by focusing on custody services, which until now have been the purview of crypto-focused companieslike CoinbaseandBitGo.
Custody is important in the world of crypto since currencies like Bitcoin are entirely digital, making them easy to steal. Being a custodian entails storing the so-called private key that provides access to a given digital wallet.
As the OCC notes in its letter, banks already offer to safeguard other digital items on behalf of their clients. This includes offering “secure web-based document storage, retrieval, and collaboration of documents and files containing personal information.”
Custody of cryptocurrency also has the potential to be a lucrative line of business, given that the market cap of Bitcoin is around $170 billion, and that custodians typically charge fees of around 0.25% to keep it safe.
The OCC letter also opens the door for banks to offer more exotic services such as “staking”—a form of proxy voting for certain cryptocurrencies—and crypto lending. Such activity is tiny in the context of the broader financial system, but has become increasingly important in the crypto industry.
All of this raises the question of whether banks will seek to build their own cryptocurrency divisions or seek to acquire some of the numerous crypto startups in the U.S.
In the meantime, one influential crypto entrepreneur,Barry Silbert—who runs the large conglomerate called Digital Currency Group—took toTwitterto express his pleasure with Wednesday’s development.

• Jim Chanos has said he is actively shorting MicroStrategy.
• Chanos poked at MicroStrategy’s NAV premium.
• Presto Research has weighed in on whether investors should worry.
Long-time investors inMicroStrategy(NASDAQ:MSTR) have probably weathered it all, from early concerns over the risks of the firm’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy to harsh mockery in bear markets and questions over whether the firm can sustain demand with the emergence of spot exchange-traded funds and copycat firms.
But even for these investors with nerves of steel forged through many fires, it is hard not to get unnerved hearing that one of the most famous short sellers in history,Jim Chanos, has taken aim at the business.

Chanos told CNBC in aninterviewon Wednesday that he was shorting MicroStrategy while longing Bitcoin.
The investor most famous for finding cracks in Enron’s business and successfully shorting it ahead of its eventual collapse slammed MicroStrategy’s valuation at a premium to Bitcoin as “ridiculous” even as other firms are copying its playbook of using leverage to accumulate the digital asset.
Chanos told CNBC he was “short the spread” because it was “so levered to the price.”
“We’re doing exactly what MicroStrategy and [executive chairman] Michael Saylor are doing,” he added. “We’re selling MicroStrategy stock and buying bitcoin and basically buying something for $1, selling it for two and a half dollars.”
Meanwhile, this trade does not mean Chanos is bullish on Bitcoin or sees value in it.
“I don’t know where bitcoin is going. A hundred thousand, a million, 10,000? I don’t know, I don’t think anybody else knows,” he told CNBC. “But what I do know is it’s generally profitable to short $1 for two and a half dollars or $3.”
To Chanos, it is simply an arbitrage opportunity betting on MicroStrategy’s premium to net asset value shrinking. The firm currently trades at 1.8 times the premium to its Bitcoin holdings, boasting a market cap of $108 billion against $59 billion worth of Bitcoin. This premium hit a high of 2.5 times the NAV in October.

In a Fridaynote, cryptocurrency research firmPresto Researchsaid there was “no reason for panic” among MicroStrategy investors over Chanos’ trade.
“MSTR’s periodic BTC accumulation resembles a growing balance sheet fueled by recurring income. This allows investors who view BTC as an eventual store of value to assign an earnings multiple to MSTR’s BTC acquisitions,” the firm said, justifying MicroStrategy’s premium.
In simple terms, the argument is that if investors believe that Bitcoin will be worth more in the future, they can value MicroStrategy not just by the current price of its Bitcoin holdings but also by the expected growth of its holdings and earnings from those holdings as the price appreciates.
But Presto Research noted that this valuation model may not hold in a bear market, making Chanos’ trade a complex bet on a BTC downturn.
“Whether Chanos understands Bitcoin enough to make that call remains questionable,” the firm said.
Chanoswound down his hedge fundin November 2023 as years-long losing shorts against Tesla and AOL weighed on his profitability.

• Ether traded close to $1,000 and is currently recovering losses.
• BNB is struggling to start a recovery wave from the $200 support zone.
After a minor recovery wave,bitcoinprice saw a fresh round of selling from $22,000. There was a bearish reaction below the $21,500 support zone.
The price declined nearly 10% and broke the $20,500 support. It traded close to the $20,000 level and settled below the 21 simple moving average (H1). The bulls are now attempting a fresh recovery wave above the $21,000 level.
On the upside, the price is facing a major hurdle near the $21,650 level and the 21 simple moving average (H1). The next major resistance sits at $22,800. If there is no upside break, bitcoin could start a fresh decline and may possibly trade below $20,000.
ETHalso followed a bearish path below the $1,200 support zone. The price gained pace below the $1,100 level and the 21 simple moving average (H1).
The bears even pushed the price below $1,050. It traded close to the $1,000 support zone and is currently attempting a recovery wave. It is facing a key bearish trend line with resistance near $1,130 on the hourly chart.
A proper upside break above the $1,130 level and $1,150 could push the price towards the $1,200 resistance zone. If not, it could start another decline and may possibly trade below $1,020.
BNBstarted a major decline from well above the $300 level. There was a clear move below the $280 and $250 support levels to move into a bearish zone.
The price even settled below the $240 level and the 21-day simple moving average. The bulls are now taking a stand near a major support at $200. An immediate resistance is near the $230 level. The next key resistance might be $250, above which the bulls could aim a move towards the $280 level.
A clear upside break above the $280 resistance might stage a strong rally. If there is no upside break, the price could start a fresh decline below the $200 level.
The next major support is near $180 in the near term. Any more losses may possibly push BNB price towards the $150 support zone.
Cardano (ADA)is showing a few bearish signs below the $0.50 level. The next major support is near $0.45, below which there is a risk of a move towards the $0.42 level.
Polkadot (DOT)is struggling below the $8.00 resistance. If there is a downside break below the $7.00 support, the price could even test the $6.20 level.
A few trending coins areLINK,ALGO, andATOM. Out of these,LINK is still trying to start a strong increaseabove the $7.00 and $7.50 resistance levels.

5185,2018-12-15 10:19:26,What Crypto Winter? It’s Perfectly Sunny for Luno with 40 New Jobs Open,"Bitcoin tumbled to a15-month low today. Ethereum has all-but petered out. Heavyweights like ConsenSys are laying off staff, and many ICO startups arerunning out of cash before launching their products. You have to admit, things don’t look particularly good from any angle.
But while crypto investors are getting used to bracing before they open their eyes in the morning, the team at Luno remains quietly confident. The company that claims to make buying crypto from your mobile easy will continue on its mission of “upgrading the world to a better financial system.” And they’re hiring 40 new employees at their offices around the globe to help them do it.
In an announcement on thecompany’s social media, they said:
“New year. New career. New you. We’re hiring in our offices all over the globe. Learn more about our different positions in Engineering, Customer Success, and Design.”
The news did not go unnoticed. Major crypto personality Barry Silbert from Digital Currency Group (one of Luno’s main investors) retweeted the post exclaiming:
“What crypto winter? Luno has over 40 jobs they’re looking to fill.”
I asked VP of Countries and Marketing at Luno, James Lanigan, what’s behind their decision to take on more employees at a time when crypto companies are cutting back. He said:
“We are looking to lead the evolution of financial systems worldwide, something that we do not expect to happen in a short-term period. Instead, we fully anticipate it to be a process which requires much longer-term thinking.”
He explained that to build a team with the necessary skills and ability takes a number of years–and that the company fully expects to grow at a faster rate in 2019, despite the bearish market.
“More and more people are beginning to understand and see the value in owning crypto, and we want to be at the forefront of that educational process.”
Want a new career in 2019? Why not launch into crypto? There may be not much hopium left in this space, but if you like a good dosage of volatile with your eggs in the morning this could be the place for you.

78688,2023-09-20 13:32:43,"Bitcoin and Altcoins Brace for Bearish Cycle, Warns Crypto Analyst","Crypto analyst Nicholas Merten has warned of a prolonged bearish trend for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins, in a recent strategy session shared with his 512,000 YouTube subscribers on Wednesday. The host of DataDash attributed this prediction to contracting market liquidity due to the Federal Reserve's hawkish stance.
Merten dismissed optimistic narratives about Bitcoin smashing new all-time highs through methods such as ETFs (exchange-traded funds), de-dollarization, BRICS, or Bitcoin bank runs. He clarified that while some anticipate a market collapse or a decline in Bitcoin's price to $15,714, he foresees a steady grind to the downside instead.
The analyst predicts this downturn will lead to many individuals being liquidated and excess money contributing to inflation being taken out of the system. According to him, this could herald a challenging period for the economy.
Merten also expressed concerns over the broader asset markets, including equities. He believes that they are on the cusp of a major shift due to rising macroeconomic uncertainties. At the time of his statement, BTC was trading at $27,179, marking a decrease of 0.5% in the last 24 hours.
Despite these predictions, Merten emphasized that it is important to remember that the Federal Reserve has a responsibility to manage the situation. His comments underline the interconnectedness of cryptocurrency markets with broader macroeconomic conditions and monetary policy decisions.

84168,2024-07-17 19:45:46,"Bitcoin soars 9% as Trump’s electoral odds rise, MAGA tokens and NFTs gain too","Since the assassination attempt of Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania last weekend, Bitcoin has risen by 9%. As of Wednesday afternoon EST, the currency is trading around $64,500, according to CoinGeckodata. The soaring price appears tied to a belief that the near-miss has further boosted the chances of crypto-friendly leaders winning the White House in November.
In light of the shooting, prediction markets have swung in Trump's favor. For instance, since Saturday, Polymarket, the world’s largest prediction market, has increased itsforecast to 70%. Similarly, PredictIt hasboosted the former president’s oddsto 67%.Research suggeststhat prediction markets, where traders buy shares in the outcome they deem most likely, may be a “better forecaster” of political outcomes, on average. Meanwhile, on betting site BetOnline, Trump’s odds stand at -300 to win back the White House, equating to a 75% probability.
Evidence of the crypto market’s growing consensus that Trump will emerge victorious, can be seen far beyond Bitcoin.
In the stock market, shares of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp reflected growing confidence in the company's majority-owner becoming president. Between Friday and Monday, the stock price jumped 48%. Crypto-related stocks are also up since markets closed on Friday:CoinbaseGlobal Inc. by 13%, Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. by 20%, and MicroStrategy Inc. by 12%, to name but a few.
Trump-themed meme coins are also rallying. Memecoins can be seen as a countercultural corner of crypto; the playful, volatile coins are flocked to by online communities during viral moments. Super Trump ($STRUMP) is trending, ranking third for most-searched cryptocurrency on CoinGecko. The token hassoared 38% over the past week, and the MAGA coin ($TRUMP)is also up 15%. The popularity of Trump-themed coins can, similar to prediction markets, serve as a signal for political outcomes.
Meanwhile, Trump Digital Trading Cards, an NFT collection, have spiked in popularity. The floor price—or the cheapest listed—of the Polygon-based tokens doubled from $230 in the moments before the shooting, to $518 just hours after, data from NFT marketplaceMagic Edenshows. The floor price is currently around $423.
On a broader level, Bitcoin has been rebounding in response to the crypto market anticipating a Republican administration expected to favor digital assets. Trump has pitched himself the “crypto president,” and is set toheadline Bitcoin 2024in Nashville next week, the industry’s largest conference with over 30,000 attendees. Moreover, this week he appointed JD Vance as his crypto-friendly running mate.
According to his Senatefinancial disclosurelast year, Vance owned between $100,000 and $250,000 in Bitcoin on the cryptocurrency exchangeCoinbase. At current market prices, that’s somewhere between $136,000 and $390,000. Furthermore,Politicoreportedlast month that Vance was circulating draft legislation that would revamp how the U.S. regulates digital assets.

For a while there it genuinely seemed possible that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could wipe crypto off the map (maybe with the help of other government agencies).
Then again, there’s practically a cottage industry of people who’ve made it their business to count all the times Bitcoin or crypto supposedly died. And, as sure as we are the sun will rise tomorrow, Bitcoin will likely keep adding blocks to the chain. That’s induction, baby!
This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the fullnewsletter here.
Without speaking out of step, it seems like the overall mood of the crypto scene has shifted. Last week the “Greed & Fear” index for measuring sentiment in bitcoin marketsflipped bullish. Beginning with BlackRock’s surprising move into the realm of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and running throughPayPal’s just-launched stablecoin, it seems like most of the major crypto news headlines are pointing a way forward.
Ripple Labsdidn’t exactly winits long, long legal battle with the SEC, but the part it didn’t lose could be significant for token issuers going forward. Industry “villains” seem to be getting some comeuppance with Sam Bankman-Friedbeing thrown in the clinkand the Three Arrows Capital jabronies getting sued.
So is the bottom in? That’s not really for me to say. But, now that the SEC has finally unloaded its worst against sector giants Binance and Coinbase, FedNow didn’t siphon off all interest in crypto and meaningful legislation has passednever-before-seen hurdles, it seems like the worst is over yet.
Sure, there are still many long term risks to crypto: proposed “custody rule” changes could put crypto into a hostage situation, CoinDesk’s semi-estranged parent Digital Currency Group’s bitcoin trust could unravel and quantum computers could one day break cryptography’s back. There’s likely plenty of tail risks and black swans and bitter ends ahead.
Just yesterday the New York Times publishedan articleessentially calling the end of people who call the end of crypto. At this point, it seems clear enough now that Bitcoin is battle-tested, and, while governments may want to step up oversight of crypto, the real anarchic core to all of this is basically untouchable.

Roche's Genentech unit was running the trial, so Exelixis wasn't at liberty to release any more information. Genentech plans to present the data at an upcoming medical meeting, although the exact one wasn't disclosed.
Image source: Getty Images.
While disappointing, Exelixis and Genentech had an uphill battle to show an effect. These are difficult-to-treat patients who had failed at least two systemic chemotherapy regimens. And the trial pitted the combination head-to-head against an active comparator. It's quite possible that the combination is helping patients, just not enough to show an improvement compared to Stivarga.
If the companies had gone after patients who had also failed Stivarga, they might have been able to successfully show the drug works better than a placebo in that setting. But if the trial was organized that way, the combination could only be approved for later-stage patients, limiting the potential market.
Cotellic, which Exelixis sells in partnership with Roche, is still approved for melanoma patients with a BRAF mutation in combination with Roche's Zelboraf -- although it's a competitive space and produces minimal financial benefit for Exelixis compared to itshot sellingCabometyx.
The duo still has a few more shots to improve Cotellic sales in two phase 3 trials in a different melanoma setting. The IMspire150 Trilogy trial is testing the triple combination of Cotellic, Tecentriq, and Zelboraf in the first-line setting, and the other trial, IMspire170, is testing Cotellic and Tecentriq in patients who don't have the BRAF mutation that Zelboraf works on.
Investors will have to wait to see the full data set for IMblaze370 before evaluating whether the results make it less likely that the melanoma trials will also fail.

Nations like China, Iran and North Korea aren’t exactly friendly to the U.S., thus cynically bolstering the narrative for the best cybersecurity stocks to buy.
Moreover, regardless of threats from unscrupulous governments, data breaches have long been a sour spot since the advent of digitalization. In 2020, theaverage cost of a data breachamounted to $8.64 million. Further, the U.S. saw an increase in attacks from the prior year, moving against worldwide trends.

One of the biggest names in the information technology sector,CACI International(NYSE:CACI) specializes in network security. According to Fortune Business Insights, the network security segment’s valuation alone is expected to rise to$53.11 billion by 2029, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% from 2022.
In particular, CACI has the advantage of providing services for both U.S. government agencies and major blue chips. While you might not get a great deal from CACI on paper — it’s consideredfairly valuedagainst a basket of valuation gauges — the company does enjoy strong profitability metrics. For instance, its operating margin of nearly 8% exceeds the industry median of 3% quite significantly.
So far this year, CACI is up 6% in the market, making it one of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy in terms of comparative stability. As well, it’s been steadily gaining over the past five years, up 123%.

Financially, the cybersecurity firm features tremendous strengths in its balance sheet, particularly itscash-to-debt ratio of 42.2, well above the industry median of 3.7. To be fair, valuation metrics consider ATEN overvalued at the moment. However, at 15% down on a year-to-date basis, ATEN could be a discounted player, especially as cyber threats will likely only rise as a problematic issue.

One of the most recognized names among the best cybersecurity stocks to buy,Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ:PANW) provides firewalls that manage applications and help prevent data leaks. As you can imagine, Palo Alto enjoys a massive total addressable market in just one subsector.
According to Research and Markets, the global network security market size reached a valuation of $4.68 billion in 2021. Experts project that by 2027, the segment will command avaluation of $16.6 billion, representing a CAGR of 23.5% from 2023 estimates.
What’s more, Palo Alto has exceptional acumen across addressing various other cyber vulnerabilities, including solutions for software as a service (SaaS) platforms and internet of things (IoT) networks. Admittedly, though, for this relevance, investors are paying a bit of a premium, especially as the company’s financial and profitability strengths are middle of the road.
Nevertheless, PANW is a powerhouse in the industry. Down about 7% YTD, it might be a solid name to add to your portfolio.

Another one of the big players among the best cybersecurity stocks to buy,Fortinet(NASDAQ:FTNT) specializes in network security appliances. In addition, Fortinet offers managed intrusion prevention systems, which is a compelling subsegment within the broader cybersecurity space.
According to a report from For Markets, “the global intrusion detection and prevention systems market is expected to grow from USD 4.57 billion in 2020 and toreach USD 9.04 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 8.89% during the forecast period 2021-2028.”
An intriguing catalyst for Fortinet is the company’s myriad financial strengths. The company features a solid balance sheet along with robust profitability metrics. A key highlight is Fortinet’snearly 18% net margin, which is up from its median metric of 10% during the past 10 years. As well, it beats out the cybersecurity industry’s median net margin of 2.3%.
• 7 Best Bargain Stocks to Buy in July 2022
To be fair, the robust attributes come at a cost of FTNT being considered modestly overvalued. However, based on a long-term technical profile, it appears that FTNT is setting up a bullish flag formation. If so, this configuration implies significant upside ahead.

Utilizing a SaaS model,Qualys(NASDAQ:QLYS) provides vulnerability management solutions. Qualys is especially vital for organizations that utilize hybrid IT networks, whether that be on-premises, endpoints, cloud computing, mobile or other interfaces. The company identifies all known and unknown assets in these networks, providing comprehensive security against myriad cyberthreats.
As with some of the other candidates for best cybersecurity stocks, Qualys distinguishes itself with exceptional strengths. On the balance sheet, the company features acash-to-debt ratio of 10.1, well above the industry median of 3.7. Moving to the income statement, Qualys enjoys outstanding profitability ratios. For example, its net margin is 22.5%, beating out the sector median of 2.3%.
Interestingly, against a basket of valuation gauges, QLYS is fairly valued. Moreover, shares have been steadily moving higher over the trailing five years. Therefore, for investors that prefer relative reliability in their market ideas, QLYS could be one of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy this month.

Specializing in threat deterrence and data recovery services,Absolute Software(NASDAQ:ABST) is an enticing idea for those who wish to ramp up the risk-reward profile for the best cybersecurity stocks to buy. According to ReportLinker, the global data recovery software market reached a valuation of $14.8 billion in 2021.
Now, experts call for the segment to hit slightly over $16 billion in 2022. From there, the market could expand at a CAGR of 8.59% toreach $24.3 billion by 2027. With a market capitalization of $458 million, Absolute Software has a tremendously large total addressable market.
To be completely transparent, Absolute leaves something to be desired financially. Its balance sheet isn’t the greatest in the world, although its profitability metrics are decent. Based on common valuation gauges, ABST might be avalue trap.

An identity and access management firm,Okta(NASDAQ:OKTA) represents a vital cog in the digital economy. While connectivity platforms have enabled tremendous conveniences and flexibility, they’re also prone to vulnerabilities. Therefore, despite OKTA’s substantial losses this year — down 54% — speculators might be eyeballing an entry point.
Indeed, Okta, like many other candidates for best cybersecurity stocks to buy, enjoys a sizable total addressable market. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global identity and access management sector is “projected to grow from USD 13.41 billion in 2021 toUSD 34.52 billion in 2028at a CAGR of 14.5 % in the 2021-2028 period.”
Now, I want to be clear that OKTA may be one of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy for speculation. Its financial strengths and profitability metrics are middling. Further, GuruFocus warns that OKTA may be avalue trap. However, the counterargument is the relevance of the identity and access management market, which is only projected to rise higher.

BCBS, which focuses on setting measures to ensure the stability of banks, gathered voluntary and confidential submissions from 176 banks — of which 115 are internationally active — in June 2024. The data showed that just 29 banks contributed to the 341.5 billion euro figure, and the vast majority hold exchange-traded products tracking crypto over cryptocurrencies.
Global watchdogs have been keeping a close eye on how interlinked the financial sector is with crypto following the collapse of crypto-friendly banks likeSignature Bank and Silicon Valley Banks in 2023. The BCBS alsorecommendedthat banks' spot crypto exposure should not exceed 2% in December 2022.
Banks appear to be following through on this; their exposure to spot cryptoholdings fell 44%between 2021 to 2022. As of the June 2024 survey, banks held almost no spot crypto, at 2.46%, instead preferring exchange-traded products. About 92.5% of banks' holdings are now in these more regulated products tracking crypto prices, rather than crypto assets themselves, the BCBS survey showed.

3477,2013-04-11 04:05:17,Bitcoin economics: A primer on a volatile currency,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Bitcoin, the virtual currency composed of digital bits, is based on cutting-edge mathematical schemes that guard against counterfeiting. But it's also based on an old idea, now dismissed by mainstream economists, about how a currency should operate  an idea that could be setting bitcoins up for an abrupt plunge. Bitcoin was started in 2009 as a currency free from government controls, an entirely digital means of exchange for a digital age. It's a rapidly growing phenomenon that has taken root as a payment method on some websites for both legal and illegal goods. Each ""coin"" has been worth less than $10 for most of the currency's history, but this week the value surged past $200  with the recent bailout crisis in Cyprus seen by many as one of the triggers of the surge. Wednesday saw a ""flash crash,"" as the value dipped close to $100 before recovering. The meteoric rise in value is also linked to what some economists say is the biggest problem with the currency: that the supply of bitcoins increases only slowly, at a rate that's coded into the system. That's a contrast to a regular paper currency like the dollar, whose supply is managed by a central bank like the Federal Reserve. The Fed engineers the dollar supply to increase slightly faster than the growth of the economy, which means that the value of the dollar falls slightly every year, in the phenomenon known as inflation. New bitcoins are ""mined"" or generated by computers. They get harder to generate all the time, which means the inflow of fresh bitcoins keeps falling. There are about 8 million bitcoins in circulation today, and the maximum that can be generated is 21 million. By 2032, 99 percent of those will have been created. Since the supply of bitcoins grows so slowly, any increase in demand leads to higher prices. That's known as deflation, and it's widely seen as a disaster when it happens to a real-world currency. As money becomes more valuable, our incentive is to hold onto the money instead of spending it  slowing down the economy. Story continues ""What we want from a monetary system isn't to make people holding money rich; we want it to facilitate transactions and make the economy as a whole rich. And that's not at all what is happening in Bitcoin,"" Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman wrote in 2011. When the supply of money is fixed or increasing only slowly, deflation can feed on itself. Investors will look at the rising price of the coins, and conclude that they're set to rise further. So they buy more, sending the price even higher. This goes on until the market is sated. In the ideal outcome, the value of the currency then stabilizes at the new high level. In the worst case, the value plunges. This boom-bust cycle has already happened once before for Bitcoin. It hit nearly $31 in June 2011, then crashed, hitting $2 five months later. In essence, Bitcoin is similar to the ""gold standard,"" the monetary system in force before modern central banking started to take root in the 1930s. Under the gold standard, each unit of currency was worth a certain amount of gold, leaving governments few means to increase the amount of currency in circulation. No country uses the gold standard today, but some libertarians want to revive it, and see Bitcoin as a modern-day alternative or complement. ""If you wipe away the misguided economics courses that we have, deflation doesn't have to be a negative,"" says Jon Matonis, a board member of the non-profit Bitcoin Foundation, created last year to foster and protect the system. ""It's not a bad thing when a citizen's purchasing power increases.""",,,,,,,,,

A bullish end to the quarter on Friday came on what was a relatively busy day on the economic calendar. Better than expected retail sales and unemployment numbers out of Germany provided plenty of relief, though it wasn’t all positive. Spain’s economy grew at a slower pace than had been previously estimated. Consumer spending in France also disappointed, though the fall in spending may have had more to do with protests.
In spite of the mixed numbers, risk appetite supported Friday’s gains to end the quarter on a high note.
When considering the negative sentiment surrounding the Eurozone economy, the CAC and DAX gained 13.1% and 9.2% respectively over the quarter. Not bad considering the doom and gloom and the effects of the ongoing trade war between the U.S and China.
There wasn’t much red on the DAX at the end of the week, with Daimler and Volkswagen seeing amongst the best returns on the day.
In spite of the upward momentum, both Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank saw red once more. The pullback bucked the trend from the sector, with BNP Paribas managing a 1.49% rise and Italy’s UniCredit S.p.A rising by 0.88%.
The upward moves came as the U.S Treasury 3-month / 10-year inverted yield curve returned to a positive yield curve.
While Theresa May stumbled at a 3rdtime of asking, the UK Parliament rejecting her deal once more, positive updates from the U.S – China trade talks supported risk appetite on the day.
It’s a busy day ahead on the economic calendar. Finalized manufacturing PMI numbers are due out of France, Germany, and the Eurozone. Ahead of the finalized figures, the one-time monthly release of manufacturing PMI numbers out of Spain and Italy will also be in focus.
Influence will come from any revisions to Germany’s manufacturing PMI, with Italy’s PMI to also have an impact.
While we can expect some influence from the numbers, better than expected manufacturing PMI numbers out of China from the weekend and this morning have ultimately set the tone.
The China manufacturing sector’s return to expansion can only be a good thing for the Eurozone, which has been under China’s dark shadow since late last year.
Of less influence on the majors will be the Eurozone’s prelim inflation figures for March. Core inflation is unlikely to edge too far beyond 1.0%, which continues to sit well below the ECB’s target. The lack of inflation will ultimately allow the ECB to ease policy further should the need arise.
Through the U.S session, February retail sales figures and the March ISM manufacturing PMI could sour the mood should the numbers be weaker than forecast. How much impact any disappointing numbers will have remains to be seen, however. China’s doom and gloom and concerns over trade talks have weighed on risk appetite. Positive sentiment towards both should deliver strong gains barring another yield curve inversion.
At the time of writing, the DAX30 futures were up by 115.5 points, with the CAC40 futures was up by 53.5 points.
U.S Treasury 3-month yields stood at 2.38% at the time of writing, while 10-year yields stood at 2.43%, supporting a 162 point rise in the Dow Jones mini early on.

89946,2023-07-25 14:54:41,Riot Platforms at the Heart of Texas' Debate Over Bitcoin Mining’s Effect on the Grid,"Texas is the largest power producer in the U.S., home to large amounts of both fossil fuel and renewable energy generation. It is also one of the world’s foremost bitcoin mining hubs, with about 1.5 gigawatts (GW) of mining as of August 2022.
These attributes make it a good place to experiment with the integration of bitcoin mining into power grids. The local grid operator, the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas, has been using economic incentives to align miners’ interests with those of the public.
This story is part ofCoinDesk's 2023 Mining Week, sponsored by Foundry.
However, these incentives, which come in the form of various demand response programs, have come under fire from local residents and legislators. They say the state is subsidizing an industry that is harmful to the environment and local communities.
Riot Platforms (RIOT), one of the largest bitcoin miners in the world, is at the heart of these debates. Riot saved $27 million in 2022 for not mining bitcoin under demand response programs, which allow large energy consumers to power off when the electric grid is facing demand surges in exchange for credits for later use.
Looking to cap the mining industry’s participation in such programs to 10%, Texas legislators recently proposed Bill SB 1751, which initially passed the State Senate. But itfailed to make it through a House committee in May.

Riot is developing two sites in Texas, in Navarro and Milam counties, with a total energy capacity of 1.7 gigawatts (GW). The Navarro site will be the biggest bitcoin mine in the world, the company claims.
One megawatt of power can normally power about 1,000 homes in the U.S., but only 200 Texas residences during the summer, according to ERCOT (the need for AC is that steep). If completed, Riot’s sites would consume enough energy to power 340,000 Texan homes in the high demand season.
For local resident Jackie Sawicky, Riot is taking advantage of state incentives for its own profit, leaving citizens to foot the bill.
Read more:Can Crypto Miners Make the World Greener?
Sawicky founded and leads the group Concerned Citizens of Navarro County – which is made up of 700 local residents – and participates in advocacy group National Coalition Against Cryptomining, which is active in six states. The Navarro group has dug into filings to try to pinpoint the firm’s impact on the community and environment.
“If Riot wasn't underwritten and subsidized by Texas taxpayers and those of us who actually pay our bills, would they even still be in business?” Sawicky asked, pointing to $509.6 million in losses the firm reported in 2022. About 95% of the losses were due to impairments in assets,filings show.
When energy demand and prices spike, the cost of the energy outweighs the price of Riot staying in operation, so “they're going to shut down anyway,” Sawicky said. Her argument was echoed by State Senator Lois Kolkhorst, who sponsored the mining cap bill, and environmental advocates at the bill hearing.
But that’s not a universal view. Marathon Holdings (MARA) CEO Fred Thiel thinks miners are actually contributing to grid development and stability.
“Most people don't understand that bitcoin miners act as great load balancers and are very complementary to the grid in Texas. They actually provide financial incentives for more renewable energy to be developed,” he said in an interview with CoinDesk.
When demand for energy is low, bitcoin miners can act as a base load of consumption that will keep money flowing into wind and solar energy producers, making their operations profitable enough that they can grow more,proponents such as the TBC argue.
This is particularly important for renewable energy, which can produce big spikes in supply at times when there is little demand (e.g. when the wind is blowing overnight driving turbines). When demand spikes, miners can easily power off, unlike other industrial facilities where constant energy is required.

Producers participating in ERCOT’s demand response programs  are supposed to ramp down only if grid managers have told them to. And some non-miners have been accused of following their own timetables, causing unnecessary electricity price rises.
“You really need to look into all the demand response programs, especially certain types of demand response services” because often, they power off early, before they are called on to shut down by ERCOT and prices have spiked, said Jason Cox, an energy consultant who works withRiotand and other miners through Priority Power Management.
The residents’ group also accuse the miners of failing to make sufficient tax and community contributions.
Riot noted a deferred tax benefit of $11.7 million in taxes in 2022, primarily due to changes in contingent consideration liability. The firm pays 100% of its local sales tax, it said, but is exempt from this duty on a state level, along with otherdata centers.
Sawicky claims that Riot saves $200 million in property tax for its Milam county site, based on public records that she has requested from authorities. Riot declined to specify how much property tax it pays, but said it’s 100% of the ad valorem property tax as set by the school district in Navarro county (assessed by the value of its investment in the area).
The company has neither received nor requested any tax abatements from Navarro county, said Navarro County Director of Economic Development John Boswell.
Riot “works with our local governments to structure tax incentives that are mutually beneficial” to both parties, the firm said.
More than tax revenue, bitcoin miners bring precious jobs to underdeveloped communities, the industry argues. Riot is the top employer in Milam county and number one taxpayer in its school district, according to the firm. The county could not independently confirm this claim.
Sawicky thinks the employment footprint is miniscule.
Riot will bring up to 400 jobs to Navarro, once it is fully operational, and the expansion of the tax base will be beneficial to the county, Boswell said. “We see this as a very clean, good project with good jobs,” with good wages and benefits, he said.
The firm told CoinDesk it will bring “250 full-time, high-wage jobs” in Navarro county and has already provided 300 jobs in Milam.
These contributions are minimal, said Sawicky, pointing to the TBC’s own testimony on the bill. The industry employs only 2,000 people in Texas, said the lobbying group’s president Lee Bratcher. Out of 30 million Texans, “that's not even half of 1%,” Sawicky said.
“These places set up shop in poor, depressed areas and they promise jobs and tax revenue,” only to drive up electricity costs, Sawicky said.
The average hourly wage in Navarro is $19, a third less than thenational average. Riot did not respond to CoinDesk’s question about the wages it pays.
At a bill hearing, Senator Kolkhorst cited a report claiming electricity bills grew by $300 when miners’ set up in New York’s Plattsburgh. The New York Timessaidin anarticlethat bills have increased 5% per year in 10 mines it studied. When miners cluster in an area, critics claim, demand and prices for electricity rise.
Industry proponents argue that miners can actually improve the profitability and stability of the grid because they can turn on and off at a moment’s notice.

Energy adviser Cox disagrees with the argument that miners drive up electricity bills. Miners “actually use power when there's way more renewable energy on the grid,” he said.
That can actually improve generators' economics, Cox said. Without this consumption at those times, renewable energy producers might have to reduce output or turn off to mitigatecongestion, a practice known as “curtailment.” By consuming when no one else wants to, and not consuming when prices are high, miners reduce curtailment while reducing the cost of meeting peak demand.
Recent peer-reviewedresearchled by Texas A&M University found that bitcoin mining can provide load flexibility that “could potentially avoid all reliability concerns without major economic loss,” while the price responsiveness of bitcoin miners can “mitigate market disruptions.”
The Navarro citizens also take issue with how Riot set up  their site in a residential neighborhood, Sawicky said. None of the residents were informed or consulted ahead of construction, she said.
Communications between Boswell and Riot’s former CEO Chad Harrisshow the companywas concerned about publicizing their activity. To Boswell, this is standard practice for a company looking to keep its location planning confidential.
On top of all the concerns about miners’ impact on the grid and local communities lie environmental issues.
Even if Riot uses 100% renewable energy, “we will never divest from fossil fuels, we will never transition to renewables as long as the bitcoin blockchain is being used at scale,” because its hashrate and therefore energy consumption is consistently growing by design, and therefore drawing away power from other users, Sawicky said.
The project could use at least 1.5 million gallons of water a day, according to records Sawicky requested. The county has faced “extreme drought” in the past year, so water is a precious resource.
Economic director Boswell said the county can meet Riot’s needs while satisfying local residents as well.
Riot declined to specify how much water it requires, but said that “the volume is consistent with similarly sized businesses with similar employee/contractor bases.”
Sawicky, a self-proclaimed hippie and environmentalist, remains unconvinced. She argues that bitcoin is a vehicle for fraud and crime and that its electricity use is ultimately wasteful. Riot and Boswell are just “guessing and throwing away numbers,” she repeatedly told CoinDesk.",29189.29,-0.01,29170.46,-0.07,29197.5,0.02,29202.05,0.04,29191.09
32117,2021-03-26 12:16:51,What to Make of Bitcoin,"Getty Images The price of bitcoin was already soaring when Tesla announced in February that it had bought $1.5 billion worth of the digital currency, sending its value climbing higher. The electric-vehicle maker said it would soon accept bitcoin as payment for its products, too. But in truth, Tesla was a tad late to the party. Several well-known firms had already embraced bitcoin in one way or another. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance, a 170-year-old insurer, bought $100 million worth of bitcoin in late 2020 for its general investment accounts. MicroStrategy, a business services company, has been buying millions in bitcoin, which represents the majority of its cash reserves. And Mastercard and PayPal have each said customers will soon be able to use bitcoin to pay for purchases through their respective networks. All told, demand has driven up the price of the cryptocurrency by nearly 450% over the past 12 months. Its market value is just under $1 trillion. (Returns and data are through March 5.) Does that mean its time for regular folks to buy bitcoin? Not necessarily. There are pros and cons to buying it, and its recent popularity doesnt erase its drawbacks, whether you view it as an investment or as a currency that you can use to buy things. What is bitcoin? The 11-year-old cryptocurrency was the first of its kind. It gets its name from the technology behind itevery transaction is encrypted by computer code, known as blockchain technology, which eliminates the need for a middleman or a central bank. Ethereum, bitcoin cash (a spin-off of the original bitcoin) and litecoin are other well-known e-coins. SEE MORE The 2021 Outlook for Bitcoin Prices, Adoption and Risks Whats driving the price? There is a finite supply of bitcoin. Only 21 million tokens will ever be made, and nearly 19 million bitcoins are already in circulation, so there are fewer than 3 million left to be created. And the rules around how the tokens are createdtheyre awarded to bitcoin miners who solve complicated math problemsalong with other restrictions mean a dwindling number of tokens will be issued in the coming years. The final bitcoin will be minted more than 100 years from now, in 2140. Story continues Such scarcity is driving demand, says Tom Jessop, head of digital assets at Fidelity Investments. The brokerage and investment firm launched a passively managed bitcoin fund with a minimum $100,000 investment requirement, targeted at institutions. Since then, Fidelity has seen a lot of interest from a diverse group of clients, including hedge funds, registered investment advisers, pension and endowment funds, and corporate clients. Will other digital assets displace bitcoin? Scarcity and increased demand could help bitcoin stay dominant. Yassine Elmandjra, a cryptocurrency analyst at Ark Investments, believes bitcoin will capture the lions share of the market for digital assets over time. There may be room for two to five additional currencies that capture 25% to 35% of the total market share, he says. Is bitcoin a good investment? It has been over the past 12 months. But some in­vestment professionals still view the virtual currency skeptically, including Matt Andrulot, executive director of research at Verdence Capital Advisors, an advisory firm for ultra-high-net-worth investors, in Hunt Valley, Maryland. Its volatile and speculative, he says. Hes right about the volatility. In just two weeks in January, bitcoin lost 25% of its value. During the pandemic sell-off in 2020, the price of bitcoin fell 49% from its peak to its trough (the S&P 500 index, by contrast, dropped 34%). And few holders are likely to forget its 83% fall between December 2017 and December 2018. Because bitcoin doesnt generate any cash flow or earningsand never willits price is driven purely by demand, so its speculative. Be prepared to lose the entirety of your principal, says Thomas Stapp, a certified financial planner in Olympia, Wash. That said, bitcoin could still have a small place in an investors portfolio. But given the sky-high volatility, it should take up no more than 1% to 3% of your assets, say many advisers. Limit your investment to an amount you can afford to lose, says Leo Marte, a certified financial planner in Huntersville, N.C. That kind of mind-set will bring you to the right allocation for you. If you do invest, consider it exposure to an alternative asset class. Traditional alternative investments, such as gold or a basket of commodities, offer your portfolio diversification from stocks or bonds. Many investors hold gold, for instance, as ballast against market downturns or to hedge against inflation. Bitcoins unique characteristics make it more commodity-like than stock- or bond-like. In fact, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission considers virtual currencies to be commodities, and therefore subject to oversight under its authority. SEE MORE How Much Bitcoin Should I Own? A Mathematical Answer On paper, bitcoin has superior properties as a store of value compared with gold. Its scarce because of the finite supply; by contrast, gold miners regularly find new deposits. Bitcoin is portable and easily stored; in that regard, 100 gold bars might prove onerous. Plus, bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places and can be easily transferred to others. However, its also three or four times more volatile than gold. But the more acceptance grows, says Fidelitys Jessop, the more bitcoin gets to become a superior store of value. Will bitcoin take off as a form of payment? Theres a lot of promise but little in practice so far. You cant go to Starbucks and buy a cup of coffee, says Stan Kiang, director of exchange-traded funds at Aberdeen Standard Investments. When that happens, Ill be a believer. Bitcoin is gaining some momentum on that front, though, as people buy crypto assets and either use them directly or convert them to traditional currencies to spend. The trend is unmistakable, says Raj Dhamodharan, head of Mastercards digital assets, blockchain products and partnerships, in a recent company blog post. Spending bitcoin can involve some rigamarole. For a payment to go through the Mastercard network for a Starbucks latte, say, the dollar price would be translated into digital assets, then those digital assets would be exchanged for dollars at one of Mastercards crypto-payment platform partners (BitPay, Wirex or LVL) before the purchase is transmitted on the Mastercard network. There may be tax implications, too. Because the Internal Revenue Service views digital currencies as property, they are subject to capital gains taxes. If you buy a cup of coffee using bitcoin, its akin to selling an asset to do soyou may have to report your cost basis and any potential long- or short-term gain or loss on the digital currency. That would make paying with bitcoin challenging, says Fidelitys Jessop. SEE MORE Osprey's OBTC: A New, Low-Cost Bitcoin Fund How can I buy bitcoin or invest in it? To buy the actual tokens, youll have to open an account at an exchange; Coinbase is the biggest. Digital assets in Coinbase accounts arent covered by any kind of insurance, but U.S. dollars in the accounts are FDIC-insured, up to $250,000. Theres an easier path, but its pricey. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (symbol GBTC , $44, expense ratio 2.0%), an investment fund of sorts, holds actual bitcoin tokens. Each share is backed by bitcoin, says Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, director of investor relations and business development at Grayscale. The trust is a bit of a cross between a closed-end fund and an exchange-traded fund. Its easy to buy and sell in a brokerage account. But you should be mindful of the premium youll pay: Over the past five years, the fund has traded at an average 38% premium to its net asset value, according to data provider Y Charts. But in volatile times past (namely 2017), the premium has reached 133%. Over the past 12 months, GBTC gained 419%. That beat the S&P 500, of course, which rose 29%, but the bitcoin trust experienced three times the volatility, too. chart of bitcoin surge",53078.06,0.1,53058.0,0.06,53019.62,-0.01,53030.46,0.01,53027.2
5216,2018-12-16 04:58:48,"U.S Mortgages – Rates Down Again, With More to Come IF the FED Turns","Mortgage rates fell once more in the week ending 13thDecember, with 30-year fixed falling by 0.12 percentage points to a 3-month low 4.63%.
The fall in 30-year fixed to 4.63%, the lowest level since 12thSeptember’s 4.60%, comes off the back of 5 consecutive weeks of either flat or falling mortgage rates and it couldn’t come at a better time for the housing sector. While wage growth may be a laggard to house price growth, tight labour market conditions, a softening in the housing sector and falling rates will give some much needed support through the low period.
A slide in U.S Treasuries drove mortgage rates south, driven by risk aversion, with economic data adding to the market angst over the economic outlook, yields falling in spite of an anticipated rate hike by the FED next week. Investors are expecting the FED to scale back its number of hikes for next year, economic indicators out of Asia, Europe and the U.S all raising red flags as the U.S – China trade war continues.
Freddie Mac weekly average rates for new mortgages as of 13thDecember were quoted to be:
• 30-year fixed rate loan remained fell from 4.75% to 4.63% in the week, while up from 3.93% a year ago. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.5 points.
• 15-year fixed rates fell from 4.21% to 4.07% in the week, while up from 3.36% from a year ago. The average fee rose from 0.4 points to 0.5 points.
• 5-year fixed rates decreased from 4.07% to 4.04% in the week, while up from last year’s 3.36%. The average fee held steady at 0.3 points.
Mortgage Bankers’ Association Rates for the week ending 7thDecember were quoted to be:
• Average interest rates for 30-year fixed, backed by the FHA, decreased from 5.05% to 4.97%, the lowest level since Sept-18, with points decreasing from 0.62 to 0.55 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans.
• Average interest rates for 30-year fixed with conforming loan balances decreased from 5.08 to 4.96 the lowest level since Sept-18, with points rising from 0.44 to 0.48 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans.
• Average 30-year rates for jumbo loan balances decreased from 4.89% to 4.80%, the lowest level since Sept-18, with points rising from 0.30 to 0.33 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans.
Weekly figures released by the Mortgage bankers Association showed that the Market Composite Index, which is a measure of mortgage loan application volume, increased by 1.6% in the week ending 7thDecember, following on from the previous week’s 2% rise, week-on-week.
The Refinance Index rose by 2%, in the week ending 7thDecember partially following on from the previous week’s 6% rise, with the share of refinance mortgages increasing from 40.4% to 41.5%, the highest share of applications since March 2018.
The MBA noted that rates fell across the board alongside U.S Treasury yields, with trade fears continuing to plague the global financial markets, exasperated by the latest widening in the U.S trade deficit.
Alongside falling rates, applications were on the rise, with purchase activity also on the up by more than 3% year-on-year.
The Mortgage Bankers’ Association released its quarterly mortgage debt figures for the 3rdquarter:
• Total commercial / multifamily mortgage debt outstanding increased by $45.4bn (+1.4%) in the 3rdquarter to an all-time high.
• Multifamily mortgage debt increased $26.1bn (2%) to $1.3tn, with total commercial / multifamily debt hitting $3.32tn.
• The continued rise in multifamily debt was attributed to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHA mortgages.
• Commercial banks hold the largest share of commercial / multifamily mortgages at $1.3tn (40%).
The Mortgage Bankers’ Association also released November’s new home purchase mortgage applications:
• Mortgage applications for new homes purchased fell by 11% year-on-year and by 14% month-on-month in November.
• The MBA estimates that new home sales fell by 7% in November and down by 5% compared with November 2017.
• Falling new home sales was attributed to affordability, with wage growth lagging behind house-price growth.
• Adding to the weakness in November was stock market volatility and some degree of uncertainty over the economy.
For the week ahead, focus will be on the FED and of greatest significance, the FOMC’s economic projections and FED Chair Powell press conference late on Wednesday. Prospective home buyers could get more relief on mortgage rates should the FED acknowledge that economic headwinds are beginning to form, with the FOMC doves likely to skew the projections in their favour for 2019.
On the data front, November housing sector data due out through the first half of the week will be of interest, with building permits, housing starts and existing home sales figures due out. It could be quite a turnaround for those who held back from jumping onto the property ladder earlier in the year as mortgage rates began to rise…

53596,2022-01-11 19:54:06,Reese Witherspoon lampooned after asking fans if they’re ‘planning’ for cryptocurrency to become ‘norm’,"Reese Witherspoon has confused her fans with a bizarre tweet regarding “CRYPOT wallets” and “digital identity”. The Hollywood star shared the post on Tuesday (11 January), writing: “In the (near) future, every person will have a parallel digital identity. Avatars, crypto wallets, digital goods will be the norm.” She capped her tweet by asking her followers: “Are you planning for this?” At the time of writing, there was no specific reason as to why Witherspoon decided to send the post, which has prompted messages of mockery. Others called out Witherspoon for what they believed was an advertisement for cryptocurrencies, with one Twitter user it “scam artistry”. Another added: “Reese Witherspoon becoming a crypto bro was not on my 2022 bingo card.” Writer Zack Davisson wrote: “A weird thing about Reese Witherspoon and Matt Damon is realising that no matter how much money and fame you have, you will always take another paycheck. Neither of them NEEDS to advertise Crypto. But they can’t say no to the check. Unless you are Tom from MySpace.” Confused by the randomness of the tweet, another follower replied: “Blink twice if you need help, Reese.” Witherspoon’s message comes following the rise of NFTs, which has been branded the “Bitcoin for art”. Reese Witherspoon’s tweet prompted a flurry of jokey responses (Twitter @ReeseW) Many celebrities and artists are now making huge amounts of money selling the ownership of digital images. The idea of NFT s gained popularity based on the rise of cryptocurrency technologies, and the desire for digital artists to have greater ownership – and monetisation options – over their craft. In 2021, as part of Facebook’s rebranding, the social media company announced plans to unveil an immersive virtual-reality world where work meetings and social events can take place. Named the metaverse , Facebook head Mark Zuckerberg said he currently does this with his employees using Oculus headsets that transform then into animations. Witherspoon was most recently seen in the second outing of Apple TV+ series The Morning Show , which has just been renewed for a third season.

34416,2018-06-06 16:12:00,Devon Energy Corp Unlocks Significant Value by Unloading Its Midstream Business,"Last fall,Devon Energy(NYSE: DVN)unveiled its2020 vision, which is a strategy to transform the shale driller into a value-creating machine for investors. One phase of that plan is to sell non-core assets to strengthen its balance sheet and bolster its ability to create more value as the companylooks to unload more than $5 billion in assets over the next few years.
The company took a major step in that direction this week after announcing that it had agreed to sell its stakes in midstream companiesEnLink Midstream Partners(NYSE: ENLK)andEnLink Midstream(NYSE: ENLC)for $3.125 billion in cash. The shale driller plans to use that cash to repurchase up to $4 billion of its shares through the end of next year, assuming this transaction closes. These moves could unlock significant shareholder value in the coming year.
Image source: Getty Images.
Devon Energy has agreed to sell its 64% interest in EnLink Midstream and its 23% interest in EnLink Midstream Partners to private-equity giant Global Infrastructure Partners. Devon Energy will receive $3.125 billion in cash, which values its midstream stake at 12 times cash flow. That valuation is worth noting since Devon Energy currently sells for about 7.2 times cash flow, which is abottom-of-the-barrel valuation versus its peers.
Aside from the sizable cash infusion, this deal will have a significant impact on Devon Energy's financial profile. First, it will reduce the company's debt by 40% since Devon will no longer need to consolidate EnLink's debt on its balance sheet. Further, by removing EnLink from the equation, Devon's general and administrate expenses and interest costs will fall by about $300 million on an annual basis. As a result, it will improve the company's overall balance sheet and profitability even though the company will lose out on EnLink's cash flow and won't use the cash proceeds to repay any debt at the corporate level.
Image source: Getty Images.
In addition to improving Devon's financial profile, this transition will unlock significant value for investors. As noted, the company is selling its stake in EnLink for 12 times cash flow and plans to use the proceeds to repurchase shares, which currently trade at slightly more than seven times cash flow. Because of that value disconnect, Devon Energy has the potential to buy back a stunning 20% of its outstanding stock if it completes the entire $4 billion authorization at the current stock price, or about 14% on the incremental $3 billion that it will repurchase as a result of this transaction. To put it another way, the company is trading about 9% of its cash flow to retire 14% of its outstanding shares.
The sheer size of Devon's buyback has the potential to move the stock meaningfully higher over the next year, given what similar repurchase programs have done for rivals in the recent past. In late 2016,ConocoPhillips(NYSE: COP)announced plans to repurchase $3 billion in shares that it would fund by selling assets. The company completed that authorization last year and added another $2 billion to the program for 2018.
Those repurchases have helped reduce ConocoPhillips' outstanding share count by 5%, which has helped fuel a stunning 50% surge in the company's stock price since it first announced the buyback program. ConocoPhillips currently plans to buy back $7.5 billion in stock through the end of 2020, which should reduce its share count even further.
Anadarko Petroleum(NYSE: APC)also has unlocked significant value for investors since announcing a $2.5 billion share-repurchase program last fall. Anadarko now has repurchased more than 6% of its outstanding shares, which has catapulted its stock 55% over that time frame. Meanwhile, the company authorized another $500 million in share repurchases this year and could spend even more in the future, given that it's generating significant excess cash flow at current oil prices.
Devon Energy's buyback program has yet to have much impact since shares are only up about 1% this year, even though it has already spent $204 million to buy back 6.2 million shares. For comparison's sake, both ConocoPhillips and Anadarko are up more than 20% already this year. Because of that underperformance, Devon Energy could rebound significantly in the coming year as it continues buying back its dirt cheap stock, making it a top oil stock to consider buying now.

Crypto Twitter went veritably ape and lambasted the idea.
Decryptcovered the funniest responsesthat day. Needless to say, Arkham CEO Miguel Morel was keen to clear the air. Hesat down with uslater in the week over a Telegram call and assured us that his model wasn’t a “dox-to-earn” program and that any harmful uses would not be allowed.
Although the case is most certainly not closed, the real hot topic of the week was Ripple’s courtroom victory against the SEC. A judge ruled that the sale of XRP tokens to the public was not a violation of securities laws—something that the industry long maintained.
Before we get onto that, however, let’s take a look at some of the other big tweets this week.

Another day, another bust for blockchain gumshoe ZachXBT. This time he was following the trail of a phishing scammer who used his purloined funds on luxury items, including a pretty loud Rolex watch, shamelessly posting pics on social media.
Bloomberg’s James Seyffart on Tuesday shared a subtle but significant amendment to the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s refiled Bitcoin ETF applications. Looks like Coinbase is everyone’s go-to partner for the “surveillance-sharing agreement” (SSA) side of the application. BlackRock and Valkyrie bothdid the same last weekin their respective applications.
The SEC wants to see SSAs in the ETF applications because they deter fraud and manipulation by outlining how applicants will monitor market trading activity and clearing activity and verify customer identity.
Crypto lawyer Lewis Cohen on Wednesday tweeted a small thread about why he’s excited for a new version of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act. In a later tweet, he even suggested the U.S. still has a chance to “set the standard” in crypto legislation and outdo the European Union’s recently passed MiCA framework.
Another crypto lawyer, Marisa Tashman Coppel—senior counsel at pro-crypto policy lobbying group The Blockchain Association—has many questions for the SEC about Prometheum, a crypto company that suddenly appeared on the scene and has been conveniently touted as an upstanding and compliant firm by the commission.
Republican congressman Richie Torres called for an investigation into Prometheum the following day.
Things went from bad to worse for the Multichain cross-chain bridge this week. The protocol has had some transactions frozensince May.

Agreement includes strategic call option to purchase 100,000 S21s at a fixed price of$16per terahash
Company is positioned to expand into the next bull market, while continuing to secure ASICs at fixed prices well into the next cycle
LAS VEGAS,Jan. 8, 2024/PRNewswire/ -- CleanSpark Inc. (Nasdaq: CLSK), America'sBitcoinMiner™, today announced the purchase of up to 160,000 Bitmain S21 miners, or the equivalent of 32 exahashes per second (EH/s).
Under the terms of the agreement, CleanSpark, one of the largest and most efficient publicly tradedbitcoinmining companies inNorth America, has purchased 60,000 units with delivery expected April throughJune 2024. The agreement also includes a strategic call option to purchase an additional 100,000 machines at a fixed price of$16.00per terahash until the end of the calendar year. If the full call option is exercised, CleanSpark's hashrate is expected to increase to approximately 50 EH/s, a 400% increase from its current hashrate of 10 EH/s, once all machines are deployed.
""This strategic agreement enhances our operational efficiency, provides massive optionality, and positions us to maximize opportunities that we expect on the horizon,"" said CEOZachary Bradford. ""We are ready to expand into the next bull market without the need to worry about an increase in machine prices, since the call purchase option acts as a hedge to this risk.""
""For example,"" Bradford continued, ""in the last bull market, machine prices increased by three to five times, and we expect the same to occur in future bull markets. This agreement allows us to manage our capital most efficiently by controlling as many variables as possible. It also provides us the flexibility to time our infrastructure growth with macro events, while providing certainty of cost on the miners.""
CleanSpark opted for Bitmain's S21 model over their T21 model or other manufacturers' units because of the S21's commanding performance. The S21 is the most efficientbitcoinmining machine on the market.
""After receiving initial units, and performing real world testing, we have determined that the S21 is more efficient and better suited for our operations,"" Bradford said. ""Being best-in-class is the CleanSpark way and we expect this agreement to keep us positioned as one of the most energy efficient and highest uptime miners in the industry. As we continue to expand our capacity, we are not only confident that we will successfully navigate the halving, but we also believe that we will unlock new avenues of growth, further solidifying our position as a top publicly tradedbitcoinminer.""
The purchase price for the first 60,000 units is$16.10per terahash, for a total of$193.2 million, after discounts and coupons. An additional 100,000 units can be purchased by the company at a fixed price of$16.00per terahash.

41630,2020-08-13 07:00:00,Nigerians Are Using Bitcoin to Bypass Trade Hurdles With China,"Chukwuemeka Ezike sends thousands of dollars’ worth of bitcoin a month in order to trade with Chinese exporting companies.
In return, he receives spare auto parts, construction equipment, and juices for a family business his father started more than 30 years ago. Ezike works full-time at Singapore-based crypto exchange Huobi as its community manager but helps with his family’s business on the side.
He saysbitcoinis faster than exchanging currencies the old-fashioned way. And he can use it to leapfrog bank limits of $10,000 a day, which he often needs to do.

Ezike doesn’t pay the manufacturer directly. Over WeChat, he works with a middleman named “Allen” who exchanges Ezike’s bitcoin for renminbi, China’s national currency, and then passes it on to the manufacturer. Ezike couldn’t divulge which companies he deals with, saying, “The Chinese are sensitive with the data that’s shared.”
He’s one of several Nigerians using bitcoin for this purpose. Ezike even helps other Nigerian companies make similar cross-border transactions with bitcoin.
In several ways, bitcoin makes sense for global trade. The currency jumps borders with ease, where other currencies encounter friction. If the counterparty is willing to receive bitcoin on the other end, it’s often faster and cheaper than legacy payments. But this can be a big “if” because bitcoin is a newer way of transferring money and people aren’t exactly used to it quite yet.
While bitcoin has these nimble properties, it hasn’t disrupted international trade and value transfer just yet, especially given the currency’scurrent limitations. If more people use bitcoin at once, the network becomes congested and payments slow down.

Behind the scenes, developers around the world are working on the Lightning Network to fix these problems so that more people, maybe one day even millions, can all use bitcoin regularly without seeing a spike in fees and sluggish transactions.
Read more:What Is Bitcoin’s Lightning Network?
All that said, some Nigerians are becoming reliant on using bitcoin as a way to trade internationally, and are finding bitcoin has significant benefits over legacy financial systems.
Nigerianbitcoin entrepreneurChimezie Chuta has another theory for why some are using bitcoin for trade with China and beyond.
Like most other countries in an increasingly globalized world, Nigeriaimports a significant percentageof the goods that it uses. As Chimezie Chuta put it: “Nigeria is a very import-heavy country. Food industry, drugs, you name it, construction equipment, cars.” Much of these goods are bought from Chinese manufacturers. “Nigeria’s economy is heavily import dependent and China is a major import partner to Nigeria,” Chuta adds.
Nigerians have to struggle with this process, though. “Access to [foreign exchange (FX)] for importation by Nigerian business owners is highly limited because the [Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)] has limited liquidity to cater for everyone,” Chuta told CoinDesk.

If Nigerians want to reap the benefits of trade, they need to hunt down a way to exchange their naira (Nigeria’s national currency) for other currencies. In Nigeria, finding U.S. dollars or Chinese remnibi is not an easy task. “Importers typically rely on the black market for the additional FX needed and that comes at a very high price,” Chuta said. This phenomenon has been coveredin Bloomberg, for instance.
This is one of the other reasons Ezike has turned to bitcoin as an alternative. “The hustle for [the] dollar and all that is quite a thing I love to avoid,” Ezike told CoinDesk.
With bitcoin, he can “take out all international banking routing processes,” he said.
Others are reaching the same conclusion.
“Chinese exporters have expressed willingness to accept bitcoin payments for their goods; hence, many business people in Nigeria find it more convenient to make such payments with bitcoin for obvious reasons,” Chuta said, adding that bitcoin is speedier, open and trustless.
Entrepreneur Monyei Chinazaekpele was able to buy clothes, COVID-19 masks and tests fromHouse of Trippyin China, to resell to customers in Nigeria.
He decided to use bitcoin after experiencing mounting frustration with current banking limitations, especially their impact on global trade. “I was enlightened about the monetary policies on the ground. I was shocked to my nerve,” he told CoinDesk.
Chinazaekpele reiterated Chuta’s and Ezike’s point that foreign exchange is tough in Nigeria. “You can’t easily switch to other currencies,” he said, adding that he’s hopeful it’s just “a matter of time” before this situation improves.
“Basically, bitcoin is stress-free to use and honestly, the naira is not a good store of value,” Chinazaekpele said, pointing to the naira’s 12% inflation rate, which means the value of the currency depreciates by that much value every year.
Bitcoin’s price fluctuates, and sometimes the price goes down. But Chinazaekpele argues that bitcoin generally doesn’t have this inflation problem because over the long term the price has been going up.
Chinazaekpele’s also looking to buy a cashew processor with bitcoin, but he’s still working out the details with the factory, which is also located in China.
All this trade with bitcoin is happening behind the scenes. Businessmen and women on the ground aren’t exactly eager to publicize that they’re using bitcoin for international trade. For one, the legality of cryptocurrency is fuzzy in the region.
The CBN has issued several warnings to banks. The latest in 2018advised banks“not to use, hold or transact in any way with the technology.”
“In the bitcoin space we don’t know what reaction to expect, so we try to be a little bit discrete,” Ezike told CoinDesk. That’s why he doesn’t want to reveal the name of his father’s importing business. By only revealing his individual name, he’s less fearful that the Nigerian government will “attack” the business.

“We have had accounts frozen at some point due to bitcoin transactions,” Ezike said. “We had to appeal to re-open them.”
He added that it’s the same situation in China, which is why the people he transacts with there “ensure they [keep] a low profile.”
As for the relationship between the government in Nigeria and crypto, Ezike said that “they are really confused about what to do with it. But hopefully they will embrace it.”

US stocks were mixed Wednesday as investors sifted through economic data and corporate updates before delving into a record of the Federal Reserve's November meeting when it raised interest rates for the sixth time this year.
A second consecutive day of gains for stocks was in question as Wall Street's major indexes wobbled. The S&P 500 a day ago closed above 4,000 for the first time since September 12, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished above 34,000 for the first time since August 16.
Stocks turned mixed Wednesday after the Labor Department saidweekly jobless claims rose by 17,000 to 240,000. The increase was more than expected and the result marked the highest number of claims since August.
Here's where US indexes stood at the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Wednesday:
• S&P 500:4,001.97, down 0.04%
• Dow Jones Industrial Average:34,125.76, up 0.08 (27.66 points)
• Nasdaq Composite:11,186.96, up 0.17%
""This is disappointing but not entirely a surprise,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note. ""We are increasingly inclined to think that the trend in claims is now rising gently, as firms come under increasing pressure from the Fed's aggressive tightening.""
Minutes of the Fed's meeting in November were set for release at 2 p.m. Eastern. As it continues to battle high inflation, the central bank kicked up the fed funds rate by another 75 basis points this month, to a range of 3.75% to 4%.
Separately, the Commerce Department said Wednesday durable goods orders rose 1% in October, outstripping the 0.4% consensus estimate.  More data are due later Wednesday, including the first look at manufacturing activity for November.

Bitcoin Holds Firm Near $23.5K
Bitcoin continued its weekend encampment near $23,500 into Monday as investors spent yet another day weighing fiendishly stubborn inflation and the prospects of the U.S. Federal Reserve hiking interest rates more hawkishly than was previously expected.
The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $23,481, roughly flat over the past 24 hours, but down from its highs a week ago over $25,000 – before surprisingly strong jobs and price data had markets increasingly contemplating the prospect of a 50 basis point rate increase instead of 25 bps.
“Markets of late have been pricing in rates that will remain higher for longer than previously anticipated because of inflation numbers that seem to be rather stubborn,"" Brent Xu, CEO and co-founder of Web 3 bond-market platform Umee, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""A possible 50-basis-point hike could be in the offing now, too.""
Yet Xu also noted hopefully that crypto markets have not seen ""a massive drawdown ... that the more alarmist crypto Twitter commentators have been warning about.""
""I suspect that we haven’t seen a massive pullback because the forced sellers have already sold,"" he wrote, adding: ""Last year’s daisy chain of blowups appears to have mostly come to an end. This isn’t to say that we can’t go lower from here. But a bottom for this cycle is probably in now, and in turn we are probably in an accumulation phase. I think we need to be prepared for sideways action for some time.”
Ether was almost equally flat, changing hands at about $1,630. Most other major cryptocurrencies were flat or edged down slightly with layer 2 platform Polygon's MATIC token and decentralized finance protocol Aave's AAVE token both recently down about 3%. TheCoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets overall performance ticked down about 0.36%.
After a week to forget, equity markets returned to their winning ways, however slightly. The tech-focused Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all ticked up a few fractions of a percentage point. Treasury yields dipped slightly but remained fretfully high at above $3.90 on a 10-year note.
To be sure, some crypto news Mondaywas ominousfor markets, none more thana reportby crypto asset manager CoinShares that short-bitcoin funds had $10 million in inflows during the week ended Feb. 24 and that long-bitcoin funds bled $12 million, the third straight weekly outflow. Later in the day, crypto exchange Coinbasetweetedthat itwould suspendtrading of Binance USD (BUSD) starting March 13 because the stablecoin doesn’t meet its listing standards – the latest body blow to the stablecoin sector.
Yet, at least one other analyst was feeling at least partly upbeat about crypto prices' path forward. In an interview with CoinDesk TV, Bruno Ramos de Sousa, head of new markets at crypto asset manager Hashdex, said that markets were ""in the recovery phase already ... past the bottom."" Ramos de Sousa noted increased interest among institutional investors in recent months.
""They're educated in the sector, and they're looking for interesting windows to come in,"" he said. ""These are hedge funds, family offices, people concerned with bottoms and ups.""

Layer 1 Blockchain Conflux Has a Complicated Relationship With China
Beijing is pro-blockchain, but anti-crypto. It sees the former as a key technology, as important in the 21st century as the hypertext transport protocol (HTTP) was in the 20th; the latter is a speculative asset that inhibits the worst parts of capitalism.
Meanwhile, ""China"" tokens are surging. ""China"" is in quotes because most of these projects like NEO, VeChain (VET), and Conflux (CFX) go to great lengths to limit their exposure to China. They have development teams in China, but the company is registered offshore.
You can use the technology within the country, just not trade the token. A version of NEO is available onChina’s Blockchain Service Network, for instance, but this exists as a seperate universe from the NEO the rest of the world sees in order to comply with local law.
In many cases, these tokens are divorced from the project. You can’t see China data on-chain, and it might be questionable as to what is driving the token’s growth.
Conflux’s CFX token is the exception to this.
Can you trade Conflux’s CFX token in China? No.
Can someone within China interact with the Western-facing portion of the Conflux chain? Also no, these parts are segregated.
But at the same time, CFX is the tie that binds the two together.
""There is only one chain, but we have two spaces,"" Fan Long, Conflux’s co-founder, told CoinDesk by email. ""You can think of the spaces acting like independent chains but they share the same consensus engine. There is no security risk of moving assets across two spaces.""
Within China, CFX relies on Conflux’s sponsorship mechanism, which allows ordinary users to interact with smart contracts without holding crypto. Stuff still exists on-chain minus the gas fees.
Developers of decentralized applications, such as China’s version of Instagram called “Little Red Book,” buy CFX from Conflux directly. They pay in fiat and get an official receipt. In many ways, it would be similar to paying for a cloud service hosting bill.
“Because the public chain must have a native token governing its resources for gas, and China does not encourage anything related to fungible tokens, we choose to have foreign entities to govern the token issuance of CFX,” Long said.
One can see on-chain how CFX is used. Below shows the on-chain activity for a digital collectible, China’s version of a non-fungible token (which it calls “digital collectibles,” and tolerates if speculation is not involved) on its version of Instagram.
In many ways, CFX could be thought of as a proxy of success for Conflux within China. But is there enough interest to drive and sustain triple-digit growth on the CFX token?

6223,2020-05-21 21:35:29,Iranian President Calls for National Crypto Mining Strategy,"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has ordered the government to draw up a renewed national approach for the emerging crypto industry.
Chairing Iran’s economic coordination headquarters – a seminar for the national economic strategy – earlier this week, Rouhani told officials from the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), energy department and information and communication technology ministries that they needed to devisea new national strategyfor crypto mining, including regulation and mining revenue, Iranian news siteArzDigital reportedWednesday.
The news comes barely two days after the Iranian parliamentpublished a billproposing to apply the country’s strict foreign exchange and currency smuggling regulation to cryptocurrencies. The new parliamentary law would also require crypto exchanges operating in the country to first register with the CBI – possibly in a move to try and prevent too much capital leaving the country.

Penalties for smuggling in Iran can include fines and imprisonment.
Just months ago, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trumpraised concernsthat Iranians were using digital assets in order to circumvent sanctions.

Iran was one of the first countries toofficially recognizecryptocurrency mining as a legitimate industry back in July 2019. The government now issues mining licenses, giving companies the right to mine and then sell off any digital assets produced. An industry report in January saidIran had issuedover 1,000 such licenses in its first six months.
Related:Iran Moves to Restrict Crypto Exchanges Under ‘Currency Smuggling’ Laws
Iran currently has a 4% share in bitcoin’s total hashrate, according to theBitcoin Mining Map, more than double what it was at the beginning of September 2019.
It’s unclear why Rouhani wants Iranian officials to revisit bitcoin mining regulation. With the clampdown on value leaving the country, in the form of cryptocurrencies, it’s possible the President wants to ensure miners, too, aren’t taking their money away from the government’s clutches.

See:Breaking Down the Basics of CryptocurrencyFind Out More:Where Does Cryptocurrency Come From?
It’s no surprise if you’re thinking about getting in on the hype. But the crypto market can be a confusing — and potentially dangerous — space for beginners. So before you add any Bitcoin, Ether or Dogecoin to your portfolio, here’s what you should know first.
Knowing when it’s time to get into cryptocurrency is key. Though you can’t predict the best time to enter the market, you can get your own financial situation in the best place possible.
“Before diving into crypto, make sure you have your financial house in order,” said Clayton Quamme, a financial planner atAP Wealth Management. “There are some fundamental financial principles you should follow when deciding where your next dollar should go — investing in crypto is a good ways down the list.”
Here are a few questions to ask yourself in order to decide whether you’re financially ready.

Ask even a seasoned crypto investor how digital currency and blockchain works, and you might be met with a blank stare. This newish technology can be hard to understand, but it’s crucial for buyers to know what they’re getting into. So you need to do plenty of research first.
“You need to understand what cryptocurrencies are and how they work, how the market and investing works, and more specifically, all the risks involved,” said Marie Tatibouet, CMO atGate.io, a cryptocurrency exchange. “The crypto market is highly volatile and there are a lot of malicious entities that are eager to steal your hard earned money.”

Next, be sure you have adequate savings. Quamme said that includes an emergency fund of at least three to six months’ worth of expenses saved, plus cash savings available for any near-term major expenses such as a house, car, wedding, vacations, etc.
Your retirement savings should also be on track, with a diversified set of investments that match your risk tolerance. “Most of your retirement savings should be outside of crypto,” Quamme said.

Quamme said it’s a good idea to have low-to-no debt before entering the crypto market. And if you have high-interest debt like credit cards, paying that off fully is a must.
That’s because the interest rate on your debt is probably higher than the return you will enjoy on cryptocurrencies — at least in the short term. So your wealth-building will be handicapped by keeping that debt around. Plus, having too much debt to your name can hold you back from future borrowing and goals, such as homeownership. So before you buy any crypto, pay down as much debt as possible so you don’t have that burden over your head.

Cryptocurrency values have been on a wild ride. The price of one Bitcoin, for example, has ranged between about$29,000to$63,000in just the last three to four months. If you can’t handle that kind of risk and the near-certainty that you will lose money in the short term, cryptocurrency may not be for you.
“In a risky, highly volatile environment such as the crypto market, it’s important for investors to set clear targets,” Tatibouet said. “Budget how much you’re willing to invest — and how much you’re willing to lose — should a particular investment see a rapid drop in value.”
“Only invest an amount of money you’re comfortable with losing and don’t take out loans or credit to fund your investments,” she added.

If you think you’re in a good position to invest in cryptocurrencies, you might be wondering how to get started. There are many ways to do it, but these are the general steps you can follow:
1. Choose an exchange:The first step for purchasing (and trading) cryptocurrencies is joining an exchange. You can opt for a popular exchange such as Coinbase or Binance or a peer-to-peer exchange such as Local Bitcoins or Paxful. Some brokerages also now allow you to buy certain cryptocurrencies, such as Robinhood and SoFi.
2. Fund your account:After you get set up on an exchange, it’s time to fund your account. In most cases, you can connect a bank account, debit card or credit card to do so. Keep in mind that most exchanges charge a small fee to transfer money, which is typically higher for card transactions.
3. Create a wallet:Once you own crypto, you’ll need a wallet to store the important keys used to access your funds. You can use a “hot” wallet that’s connected to the web; many exchanges also offer online wallets. Or, for added security, you can choose to use a “cold” wallet that stores your info offline.
4. Spend, trade or hold it:Now that you’re a crypto owner, it’s up to you how you want to proceed. Cryptocurrencies can be used as a payment method at select retailers, including New Egg and Tesla. Of course, many people are treating them as investments, too. If you are one of them, remember that a sound investment strategy for any type of asset is holding for the long-term and having patience.

99182,2025-05-29 14:59:14,"Peter Schiff Calls Bitcoin a 'Giant Cult,' Doubles Down on Gold","Peter Schiff, one of Bitcoin’s most vocal critics, took the stage at the Bitcoin 2025 conference on Thursday and didn’t hold back. During a fiery conversation with journalist Natalie Brunell at the Venetian Convention Center in Las Vegas, the longtime gold advocate dismissed the Bitcoin BTC community as “a giant cult” and said the digital asset resembles a “memecoin.”
Schiff, who rose to prominence as a stockbroker and gold bug, has long argued that bitcoin has no intrinsic value. On stage, he reiterated that claim and pointed to global central banks still accumulating gold — not bitcoin — as evidence that gold remains the true reserve asset.
“Every time I tell people not to buy bitcoin, they buy more,” he quipped. “I’m probably responsible for more people owning bitcoin than anyone else at this conference.”
His comments came in response to U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, who said earlier that day that bitcoin had created “unparalleled wealth” over the last decade. Schiff pushed back, arguing that the wealth generated by the crypto asset doesn’t represent value creation but rather a transfer of wealth from latecomers to early adopters. “It’s a pyramid structure,” he said, “not innovation.”
While the crowd responded with a mix of laughter and groans, Schiff stayed on message: bitcoin’s price, he said, is propelled by hype, not economic fundamentals. The jab stood in contrast to the rest of the week’s festivities, where many speakers celebrated bitcoin’s growing institutional acceptance and financial footprint.

97357,2024-10-30 08:27:07,"Bitcoin Teases New All-Time High, Falls Short by $175","Bitcoin (BTC)neared a new record in a dramatic trading session on Tuesday, surging above $73,000 before pulling back from its almost-historic moment. The cryptocurrency reached as high as $73,562, $175 short of its March record of $73,737, in a move traders said was one of the most watched price movements of the year.
A rally in the digital currency that started late Monday, when it first moved above the $70,000 mark, drew interest from investors and market analysts alike. Bitcoin rallied to a five-month high, reaching unprecedented resilience in the cryptocurrency market just one week before the U.S. presidential election.
Curiously, the crypto community took the near-miss pretty quietly, with social media platforms remarkablymuted. The more subdued response perhaps reflects a maturing market, with investors possibly getting used to Bitcoin's high-value trading range after its breakthrough in March.
Indeed, the recent surge has coincided with growing institutional interest, particularly through Bitcoin ETFs launched in January.Accordingto CoinShares, about $1 billion of new investments flowed into Bitcoin-related funds last week alone, indicating strong institutional confidence in the future of the leading cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin’s recent performance has become an unexpected focus in the forthcoming U.S. presidential election, with pro-crypto Trump leading in prediction markets. Following the rally to $73,000, BTC retraced slightly and settled at $$72,261, up 3.40% over the past 24 hours.",72490.07,0.02,72479.91,0.0,72230.0,-0.34,72490.0,0.02,72477.09
44000,2018-08-18 15:37:05,Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis: BTCUSD Capped by Strong Resistance,"Bitcoin price today tumbled 2 percent against the dollar, confirming a weak push by bulls in the current bearish bias.
The BTC/USD continued to extend its prevailing upside momentum, breaking above 6500-fiat to establish 6620-fiat as its new intraday peak level. However, the absence of enough bullish sentiment around the peak area, also visible during the August 15th pullback action, reversed the upsides. The pair dropped as much 4.5 percent, as a result, and is now attempting what looks like a weak bounce back.
We also had to exit our long position on a small loss when BTC/USD just fell shy to test 6650 as our primary upside. Our stops below the entry position protected us from additional risks. In the process of the latest bearish correction, we also noticed price breaking below the ascending wedge. Let’s have a look at the hourly BitFinex chart below to further understand the market’s mood.
The BTC/USD has broken out of the rising wedge pattern, but its downside is capped by strong bull supports near 6348-fiat and 6255-fiat. As for now, we are close to forming a near-term Head and Shoulder pattern, with the head near 6620-fiat and shoulder near 6255-fiat. The left shoulder of current H&S is also the right shoulder of the inverse H&S, which makes it a crucial level to watch for as the price attempts another downside.
Technically, we are in a near-term bearish bias, for the BTC/USD has pair has now slipped under its 100H moving average and a further gravity could move the pair below 200H MA as well. The RSI and Stochastic are now oversold and should stay the same until BTC/USD attempts a decent bounce back from any of the above-mentioned support levels.
As far as our intraday analysis is concerned, we are now considering it to stop putting our long position above 6600-fiat. Anything above 6500-fiat at this point of time looks uncertain due to weak bullish attempts. Moving on, the range we are watching for today is defined by 6348-fiat as interim support and 6500-fiat as interim resistance.
We are first waiting to establish a breakout towards the shoulder level at 6255-fiat, also our primary downside target. A short towards the said position looks achievable, but we’ll also put our stops two-pips above the entry position to exit the market on a trend reversal.
A bounce back from support, however, will allow us to put a comfortable long entry towards 6500-fiat. A further break, and we’ll test 660o-fiat as our primary upside target while keeping our stop loss 2-pips below the entry point.

66722,2023-05-17 11:09:37,UK Treasury Committee Urges Government to Regulate Crypto as Gambling,"Betting on crypto may soon be regulated as traditional gambling in the UK. The United Kingdom’s House of Commons Treasury Committee, a cross-party Committee of MPs formed to examine the expenditure, administration, and policies of the British Treasury, has recommended the government regulate crypto trading as gambling, according to a new report . The proposal would mean that the Gambling Commission would oversee crypto activities in the UK using the Gambling Act 2005 as its guide. It would provide “advice and guidance to individuals and businesses” about preventing what it calls “problem gambling” with crypto while applying safeguards like anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) to the industry. Crypto trades would also be taxed as gambling, possibly “with levies to support the debt advice and addiction services for which it will fuel demand.” Unsurprisingly, the Committee was thin on praise for cryptocurrencies, saying only that the “most convincing use case” for crypto is to “improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of making [international] payments.” The report recommends the government takes “a balanced approach” to supporting the industry’s development, warning that “unbacked cryptoassets” with “no intrinsic value,” like Bitcoin and Ethereum , are “particular concerns” requiring “a different approach.” The committee then flagged crypto’s inherent price volatility as a catalyst for “substantial gains or losses, while serving no useful social purpose.” This prompts the committee to conclude that crypto “more closely [resembles] gambling than a financial service, an impression reinforced by the evidence we have received of consumer behavior.” The report also cautions that if the UK government regulates retail trading and investment activity as a financial service, per the current approach, this would “create a ‘halo’ effect that leads consumers to believe that this activity is safer than it is, or protected when it is not."" Story continues The committee therefore strongly recommends the government regulates crypto trading and investment as gambling “consistent with its stated principle of ‘same risk, same regulatory outcome.’” Initial industry reactions to the report are negative. Co-founder and COO of crypto trading platform Phinom Digital Ivan Ivanchenko said “treating cryptocurrency trading as gambling would be a backward step for the UK's digital currency aspirations and another demonstration that the country is fast becoming a sea of red tape.” In a statement shared with the press, the board advisor of UK's crypto trade association CryptoUK Ian Taylor highlighted that the Treasury’s report conflicts with the Treasury’s previous proposal to bring crypto in line with existing financial regulations. “CryptoUK strongly disagrees with the Treasury Committee’s conclusion, and we are both concerned and disappointed by these claims which are unhelpful, false, fundamentally flawed, and unsubstantiated,"" said Taylor. ""The statement fails to reflect the true nature, purpose, and potential of the crypto industry.” UK and Crypto The controversial new report already has many in the industry up in arms as the British government already signaled that it would welcome crypto, planning to bring the industry within the remit of existing financial legislation. Last April, the government announced plans to make the UK a “ global crypto asset technology hub .” At the time, then Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said in a prepared statement: “It’s my ambition to make the UK a global hub for crypto asset technology, and the measures we’ve outlined today will help to ensure firms can invest, innovate, and scale up in this country.” Sunak’s primary proposal toward crypto regulation involved regulating stablecoins as ""a recognized form of payment"" under the existing regulatory regime. Crypto Companies Plead With UK Regulators Not to Follow the US In a recent consultation paper , the government announced a plan to bring crypto firms in line with the existing Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 , which governs traditional trading venues. The British government had also announced early last year that it was working with the Royal Mint—the official manufacturer of Britain’s coins—to produce an NFT that was initially going to be issued by summer, although according to the committee’s report, that venture is now officially dead in the water. About the canceled NFT, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister) Jeremy Hunt told the Treasury Committee: “We always want to be at the cutting edge of new technology in the UK, but the world has changed significantly since then and we are not convinced that the demand will be there in the same way.”",26820.76,0.01,26819.96,0.01,26658.41,-0.59,26682.0,-0.5,26817.26

You heard about the kid that threw their tax return at an obscure cryptocurrency became an overnight billionaire…with a “B” not an “M”.  Sort of makes you want to take that $1k you’ve had rotting in that savings account and roll the dice yourself. I mean, if Mikey Millennial can strike it rich with cryptos and NFTs, why can’t you? You like Lambos, too.These get rich quick schemes come and go. Bull markets make it seem like these moves happen every day and to everyone. Well, the harsh reality of Fed rate hikes has splashed a bucket of cold water on things. Risk-off has hit the crypto market harder than any other asset class on Earth.The end of this latest cycle of mania was not the first-time cryptocurrency fizzled out. The public came to know Bitcoin and Ethereum during its big boom cycle in December 2017. Bitcoin prices had surged from under $2,000 in July 2017 to nearly $20,000.Today you’re hearing more blow-outs than blow-ups. Meaning, the landscape is more treacherous than ever. By now, I’m sure you have heard of the Luna-Terra Stablecoin debacle. It cost crypto holders billions of dollars. For every one story about hitting it rich, there are dozens of scams to hear about. It may sound like an easy way to riches, but there is no easy way out.Prices have suffered as a result. BTCUSD prices came down to $16,000 into December 2022, near levels it traded at the end of 2020. Other major cryptocurrencies like ETHUSD have been hit, too. ETHUSD is close to $1,600, which is a far cry from its highs over $4,800. Investors looking to “Buy the Dip” could be tempted at these levels.If you’re thinking about diving in headfirst and throwing caution to the wind. Please...DON’T DO IT!You don't have to have a gambler’s risk tolerance or be a cryptocurrency expert to profit from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and others. You don't even have to believe in the long-term sustainability of any of these coins. You just have to recognize the game and figure out a way to profit from the underlying technology. That underlying technology, which powers every cryptocurrency on Earth, is the blockchain.If you've been paying attention to the headlines, you'll see that central banks and major retail banks alike have changed their tune about cryptocurrencies. Initially, they scoffed and called them irrelevant. But recently, the discussion has shifted and now they are acknowledging the threat cryptocurrencies bring to their businesses. What they're really saying is that blockchain is revolutionizing the way we account for data.Futures contracts in Bitcoin have been trading at the CME Group for years. Companies have begun to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, right there next to the U.S. dollar. And now, recently, the SEC has allowed the first Bitcoin ETF to trade publicly. This only adds to the legitimization of cryptocurrency as an asset class. Nowadays, crypto is not a pie-in-the-sky idea, it’s a major financial asset which poses a significant threat to traditional payments businesses. As such, it’s an exciting opportunity for investors to get in relatively early in the growth phase of an emerging technology.Continued . . .------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------""10X Bigger Than the Internet""Zacks targets big gains from the innovative businesses behind blockchain – the emerging ""Internet of Money."" As this technology grows a predicted +1,505% by 2029, shareholders in these companies could make life-changing gains without speculating on volatile cryptocurrencies.Experts estimate that blockchain technology is""10 times more valuable than the internet.""And just like the early days of internet stocks, the profit potential is tremendous. This is your chance to see our top picks to tap into this phenomenon.See our blockchain stocks now >>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------What is the Blockchain?In the digital world, a block is a digital list of records, acting as a ledger that can contain information of any kind. When these blocks are linked together, they are secured by cryptography to form the blockchain. This blockchain is an unforgeable record of all the transactions that replicates on every computer on the network. If information in a new block can't be verified by all the other blocks in the chain, it is discarded. In the case of the top cryptocurrencies, a currency's network consists of millions and millions of computers all over the world. This makes it unhackable, as a hacker would need to hack all that computing power simultaneously, a seemingly impossible task.I already know I've lost some people, but please stay with me. At this point the question within this topic is typically: What does blockchain have to do with currency? Everything.But to understand this opportunity we have to separate our thoughts of cryptos from traditional fiat currency. While fiat currency is used to buy cryptocurrency, once bought, cryptos stand on their own. In addition, the smart contract (more on this later) aspect allows cryptos to be not just an exchange of cash, but an exchange ofvalue. In a sense, these currencies are the ""Internet of Value"".To simplify, the blockchain is a public registry of assets and transactions that tells us who owns what. These transactions are often referred to as smart contracts, as they are recording a contract between two people, whether it be a transfer of currency, a good or a service.You can see how this new innovation could be disruptive to traditional businesses out there. Rather than lament this potential disruption, you are in the unique position to profit from it. How, you ask? By investing in the various areas of the market where the blockchain is making noise. There are several different angles here.The ""Picks and Axes"":During the gold rush, the ones who really got rich were the ones selling the picks and axes. That is, the companies which provided the tools for the speculators to go out and try to find their fortunes. In the cryptocurrency world, this refers to the companies which make the chips and hardware used for mining operations.Consulting:There will be a wave of companies looking for ways to incorporate blockchain technology into their existing businesses. Large consulting companies are already offering services helping companies to integrate the new tech.Cloud Infrastructure:No other industry has been as dependent on the cloud for its development as blockchain has. The need to distribute a ledger across the world, with no centralized ownership or authority overseeing transactions plays into the strengths of the cloud. Companies which offer cloud-based hosting may suffer, while those which help facilitate this decentralized network will benefit greatly.Payment Processing:Among the most disruptive industries for blockchain is payment processing. Rather than your traditional financial intermediary, blockchain technology allows for a distributed, open, public ledger where transactions are confirmed by other nodes in the chain for a fee that's much smaller than your typical fees coming from more traditional processors.Lending:We are just at the tip of the iceberg here on lending. Blockchain tech is perfect for lending, allowing lenders to spread their risk across thousands of loans in an instant, no matter the size of the lender.Miners:The miners are the most important part of any blockchain and likely the most misunderstood. Miners confirm transactions from node to node by solving the cryptographic problem and are then rewarded in units of the cryptocurrency. Already we are seeing companies which ""mine"" cryptocurrency publicly traded. These companies mine the currency then immediately sell them on the open market and pass through the gains to shareholders. Think of them as you would a pipeline company in the energy sector. These companies are small now but could become much larger in time.Investors/BDC:Some publicly traded companies are acting as incubators for other budding cryptocurrencies. We talk about Bitcoin a lot, but there are over 6,000 other cryptocurrencies in the world. These investors and business development companies (BDC) invest in promising crypto companies before they hit the mainstream.There are many more companies on the way but how will you know how to separate the pretenders from the contenders? Which of these emerging companies will be built on solid technology and which will be gimmicks? Just like the Dot Com Bubble brought with it several names which added "".com"" to their names to get in on the action, companies are adding ""Blockchain"" to their names, some in a very unscrupulous fashion.Today, Find the Real Blockchain CompaniesThis technology is already having a major impact on almost every industry you can think of, and that impact will only accelerate over time. In fact, experts predict the space will skyrocket +1,505% from $10.2 billion in 2022 to $163 billion by 2029.Blockchain is still a new and exciting technology.

23685,2020-10-21 20:46:39,"PayPal bitcoin acceptance sees cryptocurrency price shoot up $1,000","Bitcoin’s price surge d after PayPal announced support for the cryptocurrency (Getty Images/iStockphoto) PayPal has announced that customers will be able to store and spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through its online platform, causing bitcoin’s price to shoot up to its highest price since July 2019. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency hit $12,800 (£9,700) following Wednesday’s announcement, up more than $1,000 from 24 hours earlier. PayPal’s support opens up cryptocurrencies to its 346 million customers worldwide, allowing them to shop with them at the 26 million merchants on PayPal’s network. The new service makes PayPal one of the largest US companies to provide consumers access to cryptocurrencies, which could help bitcoin and rival cryptocurrencies gain wider adoption as viable payment methods. The San Jose, California-based company hopes the service will encourage global use of virtual coins and prepare its network for new digital currencies that central banks and companies may develop, president and chief executive Dan Schulman said in an interview. ""We are working with central banks and thinking of all forms of digital currencies and how PayPal can play a role,"" he said. US account holders will be able to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies in their PayPal wallets over the coming weeks, the company said. PayPal plans to expand the service to its peer-to-peer payment app Venmo and some other countries in the first half of 2021. The ability to make payments with cryptocurrencies will be available from early next year, the company said. Bitcoin’s price (green) and market cap (blue) have experienced extreme volatility since 2017CoinMarketCap Other mainstream fintech companies, such as mobile payments provider Square Inc and stock trading app firm Robinhood Markets Inc, allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, but PayPal's launch is noteworthy given its size. The company has 346 million active accounts around the world and processed $222 billion in payments in the second quarter. PayPal's shares were up 4 per cent at 1418 GMT, set for their best day in a month. Bitcoin hit its highest since July 2019 on the news. It was last up 4.8% at $12,494, taking gains for the original and biggest cryptocurrency above 75 per cent for the year. Story continues Cryptocurrency market players said the size of PayPal meant the move would be a plus for bitcoin prices. ""The price impact will be positive overall,"" Joseph Edwards of Enigma Securities, a cryptocurrency brokerage in London, said. ""There's no comparison with regards to the potential exposure between the upside of PayPal offering this, and the upside of any similar previous offering."" Today, we are announcing the launch of a new service that will enable customers to buy, hold and sell #Cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal account. https://t.co/QS6JRmG9hs pic.twitter.com/uHBatfZkbF — PayPal (@PayPal) October 21, 2020 Bitcoin and other virtual coins have struggled to become established as widely used forms of payment, despite being around for more than a decade. Cryptocurrencies' volatility is attractive for speculators, but poses risks for merchants and shoppers. Transactions are also slower and more costly than other mainstream payment systems. PayPal believes its new system will address these issues as payments will be settled using traditional currencies, such as the US dollar. This means PayPal will be managing the risk of price fluctuations and merchants will receive payments in virtual coins. ""We are going about it in a fundamentally different way to make sure we provide the maximum amount of safety to our merchants,"" Schulman said. PayPal's service comes as some central banks have announced plans to develop digital versions of their currencies, following a Facebook-led cryptocurrency project Libra in 2019, which was met by strong regulatory pushback.. PayPal was among the founding members of this project but dropped out after a few months. PayPal has secured the first conditional cryptocurrency licence from the New York State Department of Financial Services. The company will initially allow purchases of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies called ethereum, bitcoin cash and litecoin, it said. PayPal is teaming up with cryptocurrency firm Paxos Trust Company to offer the service. “The decision by one of the biggest payment companies in the world to allow customers to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin is yet another example that exposes Bitcoin deniers and cryptocurrency cynics as being on the wrong side of history,"" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group. “Let’s be clear: This is a major step forward towards the mass adoption of digital currencies.” Additional reporting from agencies.

5204,2018-12-15 22:30:08,"Downturn or Not, Bitcoin Has Still Outperformed Apple Since Last January","In January of last year, the U.S. stock market went through one of the largest bull markets in recent history, with technology stocks like Alphabet and Apple achieving record high numbers.
Within the past two years, the stock price ofApple (AAPL)increased from $115 to $165, by 43.7 percent.Alphabet (GOOGL), the parent company ofGoogle, saw its share price surge from $792 to $1,071, by 32.7 percent.
During the same period, theBitcoin priceincreased from $1,000 to $3,155, by 215 percent, even after an 85 percent plunge in value.
As the price ofBitcoin (BTC)dropped substantially against the U.S. dollar,outspoken criticsagainst the digital currency have started to claim that Bitcoin will inevitably reach zero by losing all of its value.
However, such a claim disregards the abnormally strong rally of Bitcoin in the previous year during which its value increased by more than 1,850 percent against the USD, from $1,000 to $19,500. In any market, a rally of a similar magnitude is often followed by along-lasting downtrendand a several-month-long consolidation period.
Every market goes through a bull and a bear cycle. In 2018, theDow Jonesand most tech major stocks in the likes of Apple, Alphabet, and Facebook deleted all of their yearly gains amidst an intense market sell-off.
As Balaji Srinivasan, the CTO of multi-billion dollar crypto asset brokerageCoinbasesaid:
“The reason this thing [cryptocurrencies] really had legs was after 2011 when there was a bubble and it went up, and it came down, and it didn’t go to zero. It kind of stabilized and kept coming back up. Around that time was basically when I said ‘okay, this is going to stick around, it’s got legs, it’s not going to zero.’ That was kind of a buidl year. We have this kind of bubble-crash-build phases in crypto, and that is really when i start to get involved.”
Fundamentally, the catalysts that fuel the growth of cryptocurrencies and traditional stocks are drastically different. But, all markets similarly go through bear and bull cycles, especially following an abnormal rate of growth that cannot be sustained in the long run.
Apple has gone through four major corrections in the past 11 years with every drop averaging at around a 30 percent decline in share price. In contrast, Bitcoin has experienced five major corrections with every drop averaging at nearly 85 percent. And, on average, it took the dominant cryptocurrency 65 weeks to recover and achieve a new all-time high.
Markets move solely based on the demand from investors, and if investors deem a large rally cannot be maintained throughout the years to come, even some of the largest markets can experience steep sell-offs as seen in the performance of the Dow Jones in the past week.
Bitcoin could take a longer time to recover than in previous years because the market is more structured and a big portion of the mainstream is already aware of the asset class.
But, it is inaccurate to claim that the asset could drop to zero because of its 85 percent decline in price this year because, in the previous year, it demonstrated a 1,850 percent gain and a major correction was expected after such a large movement.

Following on from an appearance on CNBC’s Financial Advisor Summit, Senator Lummistweeted on July 3, “If you are in the Bitcoin mining space, please reach out. We WANT you in Wyoming.”
She is the latest in a series of United States officials to encourage miners to bring their operations to The States. Due to the ongoing crackdown on BTC mining in China, which once accounted for around 65% of the world’s BTC mining, many operations were forced to close.
Recently, Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy,called China’s decision“a trillion-dollar mistake” and that they had “squeezed the [bitcoin] industry” out of the country.
Some miners have since moved their operations overseas, with Texas among the favorite destinations due to its cheap energy prices. Senator Lummis’ invitation to Wyoming followsa similar onefrom Miami’s mayor Francis Suarez. Mayor Suarez said his city’s own cheap energy (sourced from nuclear power) is an ideal place for the energy-intensive mining process.
Wyoming is already known as a crypto-friendly state, with some referring to it as “the promised land” for BTC investors.
While appearing on the CNBC Financial Advisor Summit at the end of June, Senator Lummis addressed BTC mining and its environmental implications.
“There was research at the University of Cambridge, that showed that bitcoin mining uses about 40% renewable energy,”she explainedto correspondent Ylan Mui. “and in the non-bitcoin mining economy, it’s only 12%. So bitcoin mining is already more environmentally adapted to non-carbon emitting energy sources.”
The senator advocated BTC at several points during her appearance, confirming that she had invested in no other cryptocurrencies.
“The only one I really understand is bitcoin,” she said. “Now that doesn’t mean that Ethereum might not have benefits as well.
“I don’t want everybody putting all their money in bitcoin, just like I don’t want everybody putting it in dollars and putting it under a mattress. I like diversification. But to me, since there’s only going to be 21 million bitcoin ever mined, it’s a good store of value because it has defined scarcity.”
As the interview came to its close, Senator Lummis revisited the environmental issue once again, saying “There’s a lot of innovation that’s happening behind the scenes. So I would say, don’t judge bitcoin mining as an energy bad guy. There are a lot of things going on that prove otherwise.”",34614.94,-0.05,34593.46,-0.12,34531.62,-0.29,34565.74,-0.2,34633.43
38711,2018-06-29 18:01:50,ALPS Adds a Clean Energy ETF Play,"This article was originally published onETFTrends.com.
ALPS expanded on its thematic exchange traded fund lineup with a strategy that helps investors target the renewable energy category.
On Friday, ALPS launched the ALPS Clean Energy ETF (Cboe: ACES), which has a 0.65% expense ratio.
The ALPS Clean Energy ETF tries to reflect the performance of the CIBC Atlas Clean Energy Index, which is comprised of U.S. and Canadian companies involved in the clean energy sector including renewables and clean technology, according to the fund prospectus.
These companies provide the products and services that enable the evolution of a more sustainable energy sector. The green energy companies are engaged in renewable energy sources, including solar power, wind power, hydroelectricity, geothermal energy, biomass, biofuels, and tidal/wave energy; clean technologies, including electric vehicles, energy storage, lithium, fuel cell, LED, smart grid, and energy efficiency technologies; and other emerging clean energy activities and technologies.
""There is a major transformation underway in the energy sector today. The transition to clean energy is not just about adding more renewables. It’s about cleaner and smarter technologies transforming worldwide production and consumption of energy. This shift is disruptive to traditional sources of energy, but it also presents a compelling and long-lasting investment opportunity for the companies and industries positioned for the change,"" according to ALPS.

• Apenthousein Miami is selling for the equivalent of about $547,000.
• The seller is only accepting bitcoin.
• Bitcoin has surged more than 1,500% this year.
For 33bitcoins, this""spectacular"" penthousein Miami could be yours.
That was the equivalent of about $547,000 on Wednesday.
The one bedroom, 1.5 bathroom apartment is listed on a number of real estate portals includingRedfin,Remax, andColdwell Banker.
""PRICE? ONLY ACEPTING (sic.) BITCOIN,"" the listing said. Since Redfin doesn't yet list properties in bitcoin, the $33 listing price fell below its minimum-price threshold, and the apartment was not available for a tour.
According to public records on Redfin, it was last sold in January 2016 for $315,000 and gained 7.4% annually since then. Justino Ferret, the agent on the property, told Business Insider that this seller is only accepting bitcoin.
The cryptocurrency has surged more than 1,500% this year against the US dollar as it gained popularity with Wall Street and retail investors.
Redfin
On Tuesday, Joseph Borg, a securities regulator, told CNBC that he had seenmortgages being taken out to buy bitcoin. Borg likely was specifically referring to a home-equity line of credit, which allows homeowners to loan from their property's value for other purposes. The idea of using a house as an ATM machine grew in popularity as the housing bubble peaked in the mid-2000's.
Converting home equity to bitcoins is not advisable, said Nela Richardson, the chief economist at Redfin.
""You're taking money out of an asset class that is highly regulated and putting it into something whose value is based on no regulations,"" she told Business Insider.
""We think this home for sale is more of a rare event than the start of a larger trend,"" she added.

37006,2018-06-20 20:02:00,5 Top Self-Storage REITs to Buy Now,"Millions of people across America have so many things that they need to find places outside of their homes to keep all their stuff. For many of them, renting a unit at a self-storage facility can be an easy solution, providing much-needed space into which they can pack up the objects they don't want to part with, but don't have space for elsewhere. Many of these storage solutions come at relatively low cost, with affordable rental rates that make it easy for users to hold onto their self-storage units indefinitely.
There are companies that specialize in building, managing, and maintaining self-storage facilities. Many of these companies are small businesses that own only a single storage location. However, you can also find larger businesses with huge networks that provide storage solutions to customers across the nation. One option available to these companies is to organize themselves asreal-estate investment trusts, or REITs, in order to gain some tax advantages over other types of companies.
Because of the regular, dependable income storage-unit rentals provide,self-storage REITs can be a lucrative wayfor shareholders to benefit both from solid dividend yields and from the growth potential involved in developing new storage facilities. Later in this article, we'll reveal five of the top pure-play self-storage REITs available to investors. But first, it's important to understand the ins and outs of real-estate investment trusts more broadly and why businesses set themselves up this way.
Image source: Public Storage.
Real-estate investment trustsare specifically structured businesses that hold interests in real estate. The majority of REITs -- including all self-storage REITs -- own real estate directly, either purchasing or constructing appropriate buildings on their land. REITs then take their real-estate holdings and find ways to generate regular income from them, most commonly by leasing out the property to tenants. The rent these tenants pay then comes back to the REIT, which meets the expenses of operating its business and managing the properties. What's left is profit for the REIT.
Not every company that works with real estate is allowed to set itself up as a real-estate investment trust.To be a REIT, a company must invest at least 75% of its total assets in real estate of various types. It also must get at least 75% of its gross income either in the form of rental income from real property or from mortgage interest or real-estate sales. It's this second requirement thatdivides REITs into two large categories: equity REITs, which hold real estate directly and collect rental income from tenants; andmortgage REITs, which invest in mortgage-backed securities related to financing for real-estate investments by others.
REIT status is also reserved for larger pools of investors. To qualify as a REIT, a company must be organized as a corporation and must have at least 100 shareholders. No five individuals can own more than 50% of any REIT's shares, and like most corporations, REIT management must be conducted by a board of directors or trustees.
Finally, REITs are required to pay out most of their income to their shareholders. If a company doesn't pay out at least 90% of its taxable income as shareholder dividends each year, then it can't be a REIT.
When new REITs initially form, they typically obtain capital from investors and seek to build up a portfolio of real-estate properties that fits with the intended purpose for that particular real-estate investment trust, through a combination of acquiring existing properties and constructing new ones. Beyond that point, REITs look like most other businesses, making strategic moves as necessary to capitalize on favorable trends while selling or discontinuing the operation of less successful properties.
For the real-estate businesses that want to elect REIT status, the payoff is thatREITs are allowed to avoid taxationat the corporate level. Most corporate real-estate businesses that aren't REITs have to pay corporate income tax on any net income they bring in. Any remaining after-tax profit is available to the business, either to reinvest in more property, or to return to shareholders through dividends. However, investors in non-REIT real-estate businesses end up essentially having their profits taxed twice: once at the corporate level, and once when they pay any taxes due on the dividend income they receive.
REITs that meet the requirements above don't have to pay taxes on their income. Instead, all of the tax attributes of the income and expenses the REIT receives and incurs get passed through to the individual shareholders of the REIT. They then bear the brunt of paying any necessary tax. But because the profits that fund the dividend distribution from the REIT haven't been subject to tax, the REIT is able to pay a larger amount of income to its shareholders than it would ordinarily be able to pay if it were a regular corporation.
Investors like the real-estate investment trust structure because it ensures they'll be able to receive the lion's share of any income the REIT generates. With ordinary real-estate businesses, there's no obligation for the company to make any dividend distribution to investors, forcing shareholders to sell stock if they need cash from their investment. Because of the 90% net income payout requirement for REITs, shareholders can feel confident that they'll get valuable dividends as long as the REIT remains profitable.
In addition, the fact that REITs don't have to pay corporate-level tax enables them to paydividend yields that are often abovewhat a typical corporation would pay. Yields in the 3% to 5% range are quite common for real-estate investment trusts, and some REITs pay even higher dividends. That compares favorably to the roughly 2% average dividend yield for the stock market as a whole, so it's easy to understand why income-oriented investors might find REITs quite attractive.
Self-storage facilities have become a popular niche for real-estate investors, and self-storage REITs have naturally followed. There are several reasons self-storage has advantages that many other REITs can't match.
First, self-storage facilities require just about the least amount of capital expenditure in order to build and maintain. Think about it: Residential and office buildings have to be built to strict codes to ensure the safety of residents and occupants, and malls and other retail operations have to be attractive enough to draw in shoppers and support the businesses who rent space there. By contrast, self-storage facilities can be as simple as inexpensive prefabricated metal buildings on open land on the outskirts of an urban or suburban area. With lower expenses, greater income is available.
Also, turnover at self-storage facilities isn't as high as you might expect. It's easy for a homeowner to rent out a storage unit and never even think about it, keeping their stuff there and making monthly payments for years on end. That tends to remain true regardless of whether the overall economy is strong or weak. In an environment in which mall occupancies are declining and technological changes like telecommuting could pose long-term threats to the office andmall REITspaces, inertia serves self-storage REITs quite well.
Finally, there's still room for growth. Although demand has been climbing, only about 10% of U.S. households rent self-storage space, according to industry estimates. The potential for further share-price growthplusdividend income is a big draw for REIT investors, and self-storage has a lot of promise.
Evaluating real-estate investment trusts is different from looking at regular stocks. In particular, there are somespecific metrics that apply to REITsthat aren't relevant in most other industries, and they play a vital role in judging the relative success of different players in the industry.
First,funds from operations, or FFO, is an accounting term that shows how profitable a REIT is. It's similar to net income for regular companies, but it excludes the extensive depreciation that real-estate investment trusts typically have because of their large portfolios of real-estate holdings. REITS often make further adjustments to FFO to reflect what income came from regular operations and what came from one-time sales of properties.
For self-storage facilities in particular, occupancy rates are extremely important. They're typically measured as a percentage of square footage occupied divided by total square footage available. With some types of REITs, having substantial portions of space vacant is simply part of the business cycle, and it's worth holding a property empty if it can lead to finding a high-quality tenant that will make a long-term commitment. Storage space is more of a commodity item, though, and that makes it vital for successful self-storage facilities to have occupancy rates that are as high as possible. Investors should expect newly built facilities to take time to ramp up to full capacity, but persistent high vacancy rates can indicate poor decision-making in picking a location for the self-storage facility.
Certain other metrics can be helpful for REIT investors to consider, although they aren't quite as important in the self-storage context. Net asset value measures the total current market value of real-estate holdings in the REIT's portfolio, reduced by any outstanding debt. Thedebt-to-equity ratiogives an indication of how much leverage a REIT takes on by comparing outstanding debt to the shareholder equity measured on the company balance sheet.
Finally, REIT investors look for income, so it's helpful to know their dividend yield, or the total annual distributions divided by share price. This figure shows you how REITs compare in terms of the amount of income they're able to generate from their holdings, as well as giving an indication about whether a particular REIT's shares carry a higher valuation than others.
Below are five of the most promising top self-storage REITs for investors to consider.
[{""Stock"": ""Public Storage(NYSE: PSA)"", ""Market Capitalization"": ""$37.6 billion"", ""Current Dividend Yield"": ""3.7%""}, {""Stock"": ""Extra Space Storage(NYSE: EXR)"", ""Market Capitalization"": ""$13 billion"", ""Current Dividend Yield"": ""3.5%""}, {""Stock"": ""CubeSmart(NYSE: CUBE)"", ""Market Capitalization"": ""$5.8 billion"", ""Current Dividend Yield"": ""4.2%""}, {""Stock"": ""Life Storage(NYSE: LSI)"", ""Market Capitalization"": ""$4.4 billion"", ""Current Dividend Yield"": ""4.7%""}, {""Stock"": ""National Storage Affiliates(NYSE: NSA)"", ""Market Capitalization"": ""$2.4 billion"", ""Current Dividend Yield"": ""3.9%""}]

These REITs all cover self-storage facilities, but they still have differences that distinguish them from each other. That gives investors a chance to tailor their exposure to match up with the risks they're willing to take and the opportunities they see in the self-storage space.
Public Storage is by far the largest playerin the self-storage REIT space. The company built its first self-storage facility back in 1972, but today, it has almost 2,400 locations in the U.S. as well as more than 220 facilities in seven different nations in Western Europe through its 49% interest in Shurgard Europe. All told, the REIT has more than 170 million rentable square feet of real estate, and based on the number of tenants it serves,Public Storage is one of the biggest landlordsof any type in the world.
Size gives Public Storage the advantage of stability. In its most recent quarter, the REIT posted a nearly 5% rise in core funds from operations, with a better than 2% rise in same-store revenue among more than 2,000 facilities. Rental rates and revenue per available square foot have showed consistent gains, and occupancy rates well above 90% show the high levels of demand for storage space right now.
Public Storage owes its success to itsearly vision. Historically, the self-storage business was highly fragmented, with local owners typically having, at most, a few locations concentrated within a close distance. Early in its history, Public Storage saw the potential network effects that could come from pulling together self-storage facilities in different cities under one corporate umbrella, building a brand that those who needed storage space could rely on wherever they lived. Smart acquisitions of those local, mom-and-pop storage facilities have added up to a nationwide presence for the REIT, making it harder for other local owners to compete, and thereby clearing the field for further dominance in key markets. As Americans have accumulated more possessions over time, and have consequently needed more storage space, Public Storage has become the go-to provider for many of those seeking a place to put their things.
For income investors,Public Storage has been a reliable dividend-payer. The company has boosted its payout nine times in the past decade, quadrupling its payout since late 2007. Even with the share price having climbed substantially, the current $2 per share quarterly payout still works out to a solid 3.7%. Combine that with the long-term share-price appreciation that the stock has shown, and Public Storage deserves its reputation as a strong leader in self-storage.
Extra Space Storage is a smaller company than Public Storage, but it's been aggressive in its efforts to expand. Since its start in 1977, Extra Space has acquired a portfolio of more than 1,400 stores in 38 states, with only a wide swath of the Northern Plains and Mountain West standing out as an obvious gap in its geographical coverage. It's been expanding aggressively, spending billions of dollars to bring its total network to about 910,000 units and 103 million square feet of rentable space.
Extra Space has done a good job of treating dividend investors well, paying a current yield of 3.5% and having grown its quarterly payouts by more than eightfold since 2010. The REIT's most recent boost came just last month, with a 10% increase bringing the payout to $0.86 per share on a quarterly basis. Yet Extra Space has also rewarded its shareholders with growth. Even when you ignore the impact of dividends, the REIT's share price has jumped more than 500% over the past decade.
Further expansion is in the cards for Extra Space. In its most recent quarter, the company spent more than $300 million on acquisitions, including three operating stores and 41 properties to its third-party management platform. By both owning and operating facilities, Extra Space makes maximum use of its expertise and broadens its options beyond solely company-owned storage facilities. That's been a winning strategy for the REIT thus far, and it looks poised to continue to succeed going forward.
CubeSmart aims to make itself the one-stop storage option for all sorts of customers. In addition to traditional personal storage options, the company also highlights its selections for business, vehicle, and military storage. The REIT also offers ancillary related services, such as logistics support for receiving packages or retrieving items from storage, moving services like truck rentals and professional movers, organizational supplies, customized storage, and even office amenities like workstations with Wi-Fi.
CubeSmart owns 485 stores with 33.8 million rentable square feet, with an occupancy rate of about 90% as of the first quarter of 2018. It also has third-party management responsibility over nearly 500 additional locations, providing another 32.5 million square feet to its overall portfolio. CubeSmart has been acquiring properties both outright and through partially owned joint ventures, and the REIT has seen good enough results that it boosted its guidance on earnings and funds from operations for the full year.
For dividend investors, CubeSmart's 4.2% yield is fairly high, even in the storage space. Its current quarterly payout of $0.30 per share is 12 times the $0.025 per share it paid as recently as late 2010. Long-term price gains haven't been as impressive as what Extra Space has seen, but the stock is still up more than 30% in the past year even before you include the impact of dividends. With along history of strong performance, CubeSmart is still well-positioned to keep growing.
Life Storage is the highest-yielding self-storage REIT on this list, with a current yield of around 4.6%. The Buffalo-based company has about 700 self-storage facilities with more than 45 million square feet in 28 different states, and it serves about 390,000 customers. The company has recently gone through a brand change, having previously been known under the Uncle Bob's Self Storage andSovran Self Storage names. Interestingly, the REIT was originally opened as a financial planning firm, but it opened a Florida self-storage location shortly thereafter, in 1985, and then grew very quickly. Expansion took it first along the East and Gulf Coasts, and then into the Midwest before making it to the West Coast in 2016 with the acquisition that gave the self-storage REIT its current name.
The pace of Life Storage's historical dividend growth hasn't been quite as impressive as those of some of its peers, but it's still a notable increase. Since 2013, the company has boosted its quarterly payout seven times, going from $0.45 to $1 per share. Unfortunately, the stock has lagged behind some of its peers in recent years. But with the branding change, Life Storage has been able to add third-party management as a more significant part of its overall business. Management fees hold the prospect of improving overall profit substantially, and that's led to a bounce for the share price.
Recent results for Life Storage have been encouraging. In the first quarter of 2018, net income jumped by more than 60%, and funds from operations were up modestly from year-ago levels. Same-store revenue and net operating income were both higher by 2.5%, and Life Storage sports an occupancy rate of about 91%. Like its competitors, Life Storage has continued growing by acquisition. With a new image, investors will be interested to see how far the self-storage REIT can climb.
The smallest REIT on the list is National Storage Affiliates. It's also the newcomer of the group, having come public back in 2015. It has more than 550 storage properties located in 29 different U.S. states, and it has about 34 million rentable square feet in its portfolio. This puts the company at No. 6 in terms of owners and operators of self-storage facilities in the U.S., and its overall strategy is to take the best regional operators in the business and tie them together with markets that have the best fundamental prospects for growth.
For dividend investors, that's been a good philosophy so far. In just over three years, the REIT has almost doubled its quarterly payout, with seven increases in just a dozen quarterly periods. Also, National Storage has seen its share price more than double, leaving its rivals on this list in the dust. Even with that rise in the stock, National Storage still sports a yield approaching 4%, putting it in the middle of the pack.
Fundamentally, National Storage is working hard to grow. Funds from operations in the first quarter of 2018 were up more than 20% from year-ago levels, and the REIT spent about $145 million on acquisitions of roughly 25 self-storage properties. Occupancy was a bit low, at 87%, but that arguably reflects the pace at which the self-storage specialist has worked to build up its portfolio of properties. For those who prefer smaller players in an industry with plenty of room for growth, National Storage Affiliates has a lot of runway left to compete with its bigger rivals.
It's important to understand that self-storage REITs aren't a perfect investment. They do have risks associated with them, and it's important to assess those risks carefully before investing.
The biggest risk among self-storage REITs right now is the threat of over-expansion. After having been off the radar for many investors who saw these facilities as low-rent, low-quality real-estate holdings, self-storage has shown how lucrative it can be, and that's invited more competition. If too many players move into a given market, the result will be reduced occupancy rates that threaten profitability.
In addition, like any REIT, self-storage REITs are vulnerable to interest rate increases. As rates rise, the interest expense on loans that self-storage REITs borrow to buy or build facilities goes up. In order for their dividend yields to rise in line with prevailing interest rates, share prices for REITs typically have to fall. Investors have seen that trend play out recently.
Finally, changes in overall economic conditions in a particular location can dramatically affect the supply and demand dynamics for storage facilities. That's less of an issue with broadly diversified national self-storage REITs, but smaller companies that have greater concentrations in particular areas can take bigger hits. For instance, the shift in population away from the Rust Belt toward the South is likely to put pressure on self-storage holdings in areas with declining populations while promoting rapid expansion in popular locations.
Real-estate investment trusts can be a great way for investors to get the combination of income and growth they want, and REITs that concentrate in the self-storage arena have largely escaped notice even among those who've paid attention to other types of real-estate investments. With these five selections, you can choose from a well-diversified set of self-storage REITs that can help you round out your income-producing portfolio.

87869,2025-02-07 13:46:24,"KBW Starts Strategy Coverage With Outperform, Says Firm Offers Leveraged Bitcoin Exposure","Strategy (MSTR), the company formerly known as MicroStrategy, is an appealing investment for equity investors looking for levered bitcoin (BTC) exposure, investment bank KBW said in a research report Thursday.
KBW assumed coverage of Strategy with an outperform rating and a $560 price target. The shares were 1% higher at around $329 in early trading.
Once Strategy, the company co-founded by Michael Saylor, adopts the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) updated accounting treatment for bitcoin holdings in the first quarter of this year, it will shift from an ""outdated measurement approach to fair value accounting, with unrealized gains/losses flowing to net income,"" analyst Bill Papanastasiou wrote.
The company reported an impairment loss of $1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024 because it did not adopt new FASB rules.
One of the most important criteria for joining the S&P 500 index is positive net earnings in the last quarter and the sum of the previous four quarters, the report said.
Strategy has the ""largest bitcoin treasury held by a public operating company,"" , and the company has a number of tools it could use to expand its BTC stack, KBW said.
In the longer term, there is also the opportunity for Strategy to generate yield on-chain from applications built on the Bitcoin network, the bank said.
The development of applications on top of the Bitcoin network could result in a massive value unlock, as it is the most secure, decentralized and valuable public blockchain, the report added.

19274,2020-10-14 12:48:15,First Mover: Privacy Is Litecoin’s Ace in the Hole as JPMorgan Touts Bitcoin,"Litecoin(LTC), a nine-year-old cryptocurrency whose price returns have chronically underperformed the bigger and better-knownbitcoinin recent years, is hitching its wagon to a new star: privacy.
The blockchain industry subsector of “privacy coins” – cryptocurrencies with embedded technology that shields identifying information from public view – is becoming one of this year’s hottest buys. One of the biggest privacy coins,zcash(ZEC), which offers “shielded transaction” capabilities, has nearly tripled so far in 2020, whilemonero(XMR), which uses a technique called “ring signatures” to obscure sender and receiver data, has doubled.
Litecoin founder Charlie Lee told CoinDesk in an interview the project is now looking to adopt key privacy-enhancing features, which he sees as increasingly attractive to cryptocurrency users. The enhancements are already being tested, and an upgrade to the main network is scheduled for next year.If the effort succeeds, it might inject ajolt of enthusiasminto a project that has suffered from a lack of momentum in digital-asset markets. Litecoin is up 21% this year after a 38% gain in 2019, which pales in comparison to bitcoin’s 59% year-to-date gain and a 94% increase last year.

“I want to make it so that users don’t have to worry about giving up their financial privacy by using litecoin,” Lee said. “Even if you’re not doing anything illegal, you don’t want people to know how much money you have or what your paycheck is.”– Daniel CawreyRead More:In Effort to Differentiate, Litecoin Makes a Move to Privacy
Bitcoin is hovering near $11,400 at press time, having snapped a six-day winning trend with a 1% drop on Tuesday.

Notably, the cryptocurrency formed an “inside day” candle on Tuesday, aborting the immediate bullish technical outlook. Inside day candle occurs when the cryptocurrency trades well within the preceding day’s high and low and indicates consolidation.
As such, Tuesday’s high of $11,567 is now the level to beat for the bulls. A break above that level would signal a continuation of the recent rally and open the doors for resistances above $12,000.
Alternatively, acceptance under Tuesday’s low of $11,314 would imply a bearish reversal and could yield deeper declines.
That said, the on-chain metrics favor a continued rally. The seven-day average of bitcoin’s hashrate or measure of the processing power dedicated to the blockchain rose to a record high of 144.29 exa hashes per second (quintillion hashes per second) on Tuesday, surpassing the previous peak of 143.19 EH/s observed on Sept. 18, according to data source Glassnode.
It indicates high miner confidence in the cryptocurrency’s price prospects. Miners largely operate on cash and liquidate their BTC holdings to fund operations. As such, they are likely to dedicate more resources to the computer-intensive mining process if they are bullish on price.

57512,2021-05-27 12:59:12,Should You Retain SBA Communications (SBAC) Stock Presently?,"SBA Communications CorporationSBAC is seeing high demand for its tower assets, as wireless service providers continue to advance their wireless networks. However, a highly leveraged balance sheet limits its ability to withstand any unexpected negative externalities in the future.
High mobile data usage, increased innovation, and adoption of data-driven mobile devices and applications such as machine-to-machine connections, social networking and streaming of video, and deployments of 5G networks have compelled carriers to advance their wireless networks.
Notably, a ramp in 5G-related investments, the timing of C-Band spectrum activity from some large customers, and initial leasing contributions from the Dish agreement are projected to increase SBA Communications’ leasing revenues in the ongoing year.
Amid the tailwinds, the company is also expanding its portfolio on the back of acquisitions. Subsequent to the first-quarter 2021 end, it purchased or agreed to purchase 413 communication sites for $110.2 million. The majority of the transactions is expected to close by the end of third-quarter 2021 and will aid the company to capitalize on the wireless use potential of the assets.
Moreover, a robust balance sheet and operational strength provide flexibility to the company to be opportunistic regarding investment choices, share repurchases and dividend growth.
In fact, the site-leasing business model offers operational resilience with stable revenues. Markedly, the company generates the majority of its revenues from long-term tower leases that have built-in rent escalators. Hence, with high operating margins, its tower-leasing business remains attractive.
Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 20.4% over the past three months compared with the industry's growth of 12.2%. You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
However, the company has high customer concentration, withVerizonVZ,AT&TT andT-MobileTMUS accounting for the majority of its domestic site-leasing revenues. Loss of any of the customers or consolidation among them or a reduction in network spending will lead to a significant material impact on the company’s top line.
SBA Communications had $12.1 billion of total debt and leverage of 7.6X as of the first-quarter end. First-quarter leverage ratio surpassed the company’s target of 7X-7.5X due to the PG&E acquisition deal. Moreover, its debt-to-capital ratio is higher than the industry average.
Also, the company’s international footprint and geographic diversification expose it to adverse foreign currency translation impact. In fact, foreign exchange headwind negatively impacted first-quarter revenues by $12.6 million on a year-over-year basis.
Blockchain and cryptocurrency have sparked one of the most exciting discussion topics of a generation. Some call it the “Internet of Money” and predict it could change the way money works forever. If true, it could do to banks what Netflix did to Blockbuster and Amazon did to Sears. Experts agree we’re still in the early stages of this technology, and as it grows, it will create several investing opportunities.Zacks has just revealed 3 companies that can help investors capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.See 3 crypto-related stocks now >>

13447,2018-01-16 14:16:00,Better Buy: Himax Technologies (HIMX) vs. Qualcomm (QCOM),"ChipmakersHimax(NASDAQ: HIMX)andQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM)took investors in completely different directions in 2017. Himax surged 73%, while Qualcomm limped to the finish with a 2% decline.
I compared these two stocks last September and told investors toavoid both stocks. At the time, I thought Himax's stock was overvalued, and that Qualcomm faced too many legal headwinds from regulators and OEMs. But looking ahead into 2018, we should reevaluate both chipmakers to see if either stock is worth buying.
Image source: Getty Images.
Himax generates most of its revenue from sales of display driver ICs (integrated circuits) for monitors, tablets, and smartphones. Demand for these ICs is cyclical, and was throttled by weak LCD sales over the past year.
To pivot away from display driver ICs, Himax started producing more non-driver components for augmented reality, virtual reality, and 3D-sensing devices. Its LCOS (liquid crystal on silicon) products areespecially importantfor AR and VR devices since they clarify images by blocking light with highly reflective crystals.
Qualcomm generates most of its revenue from sales of mobile chipsets. Its Snapdragon SoCs (system on chips) -- which bundle together application processors, graphics processing units, and baseband modems -- make it the top mobile chipmaker in the world.
However, Qualcomm generates most of its profits from its portfolio of wireless patents. These patents let Qualcomm take a cut (of up to $5) of the wholesale price of every phone sold worldwide. Qualcomm traditionally uses this higher-margin business to support its lower-margin chipmaking business.
Himax's revenue has fallen annually for three straight quarters due to the softness of the LCD market, and analysts expect its full-year revenue and earnings to respectively fall 14% and 43%.
That forecast looks bleak, but analysts also expect the LCD market to slightly recover in fiscal 2018 on higher demand for automotive LCDs and new TVs. More importantly, they expect Himax's non-driver revenues to significantly rise on the growth of the AR, VR, and 3D-sensing markets.
That business has some big backers.Alphabet's Google, which used Himax components in Google Glass, already owns a 6% stake in the company. Himax also supplies WLO (wafer-level optics) chips for the Face ID feature inApple's iPhone X, as well as chips forMicrosoft's HoloLens AR headset.
Microsoft's HoloLens. Image source: Microsoft.
These catalysts, along with demand from other AR, VR, and 3D-sensing customers, are expected to lift Himax's revenue and earnings by 30% and 75% respectively in fiscal 2018, which started on Jan. 1. But if demand for AR and VR devicesremains tepid, Himax could struggle to meet those estimates.
Qualcomm posted top-line declines for two straight quarters due toongoing problemswith its licensing business. The unit is besieged by regulators and OEMs, all of which claim that Qualcomm's licensing fees are unreasonably high and should only cover the wireless components instead of entire devices.
Qualcomm was already fined nearly $1 billion in China, and is appealing about $1.7 billion in additional fines in South Korea and Taiwan. Unfortunately, it also faces similar probes in the US and Europe. Meanwhile,Appleordered its suppliers to halt all licensing payments to Qualcomm, which reportedly inspired another major OEM (likelyHuawei) to also stop its payments.
All these headwinds threaten to gut Qualcomm's most profitable business. Qualcomm tried to diversify away from these mobile troubles by buyingNXP Semiconductors, the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world, but that buyout is now in limbo, with European regulators reviewing the deal and NXP investorswithholding their shares. To further complicate things,Broadcomis attempting to buy Qualcomm (and possibly NXP) in a hostile takeover.
Wall Street expects Qualcomm's revenue and earnings to respectively fall 2% and 17% this year. But for fiscal 2019, which will start on Sep. 25, its revenue could rise 3% as its earnings grow 7%.
Himax trades at nearly 200 times trailing earnings, compared to the industry average of 26 for semiconductor makers. But its forward P/E of 43, while still lofty, looks more reasonable.
Qualcomm trades at 40 times trailing earnings due to the licensing headwinds hurting its earnings growth, but its forward P/E of 17 looks much cheaper. Qualcomm also pays a forward dividend yield of 3.5%, which is higher than Himax's 2.2% yield.
I'm still not buying either stock at these prices yet, but Himax's brighter growth prospects, its ""best in breed"" position in the LCOS market, and a potential rebound in the LCD market this year all make it a better investment than Qualcomm.

44612,2019-10-19 22:56:46,The Magnificent Seven! Influencers you should be following on Twitter,"Like it or not, social media has taken greater protagonism in our lives lately. Once just a place to manage our friends and acquaintances, it’s now giving everyday people a voice–and many of these voices end up making their way into the news or even shaping it. Not so long ago, it would have been unthinkable to have the world’s most powerful man tweeting incessantly about political matters and world leaders. Our record Economy would CRASH, just like in 1929, if any of those clowns became President! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2019 And, let’s be honest, many of us are still somewhat bemused by Mr Tump’s ability to whack out so many tweets and still run a country. However, Instagram, Twitter, Telegram, Reddit… love them or hate them, they can be goldmines of information. This is especially true in the cryptocurrency space that moves at such a fast pace. Rather than wait to open up a broadsheet over a coffee, we often find out the latest developments with key companies and players off the back of a tweet. So with that in mind, here are six crypto personalities that you should be following on Twitter if you want to stay in the loop. 1. Erik Voorhees CEO and Co-founder of ShapeShift exchange, Libertarian Erik Voorhees has been making moves in the cryptocurrency space since the early days. Throughout his career, he’s had run-ins with US regulators, been forced to set his company up in crypto-friendly Switzerland , and had his fair share of battles to overcome. Many criticised his move to implement KYC to his notoriously anonymous exchange in which you could trade crypto to crypto without passing verification checks. However, Voorhees recognises that if you want to stay in business, you have to make some compromises along the way. A fountain of knowledge about Bitcoin and a staunch believer in the eventual collapse of the fiat system Voorhees is active and vocal on Twitter. Story continues Obvious trend is obvious… crypto, by increments, is taking over the financial world. This process will take 1-3 decades and its final form is the collapse and abandonment of fiat currency. https://t.co/VVhH8qqwXB — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) October 16, 2019 You can learn a lot from him about the importance of financial sovereignty and removing the power from governments. He’s not the kind to descend into petty battles, either. You’ll find high-quality thought-provoking tweets from him that aren’t afraid to ask the hard questions. 2. Nick Szabo Many people new to cryptocurrency incorrectly believe that it was the Ethereum blockchain that invented smart contracts. In fact, Nick Szabo first proposed the idea back in 1994. As an American computer scientist, he invented a virtual currency called ‘Bit Gold’ a full 10 years before Bitcoin came out. This has lead to many a rumour in the industry that Szabo is the real Satoshi Nakamoto . He’s repeatedly denied this. He is, however, a blockchain and cryptocurrency pioneer, a Bitcoin maximalist, and an extremely knowledgeable (and outspoken) person. Multitudes and charlatans have entered the cryptocurrency and smart contract spaces who not only lack cypherpunk sensibilities, but hate cypherpunk values, including the values such as trust minimization that give cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin their market values. — Nick Szabo 🔑 (@NickSzabo4) October 16, 2019 He’s also very active on Twitter. Hop on over to his page on any given day and Szabo is usually involved in an active debate on how blockchain technology should be developed – and giving out his heated opinions. The consensus protocol which caused the Bitcoin revolution happens inside thousands of computers. ""Social consensus"" is completely different and is as much of a mess as it ever was. Bitcoin wins by maximizing the role of the former and ruthlessly minimizing the latter. — Nick Szabo 🔑 (@NickSzabo4) October 16, 2019 3. Changpeng Zhao (CZ) Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has come from humble beginnings to be one of the most influential (and likeable) people in the cryptocurrency space. As the CEO of Binance and orchestrator of its many innovations, you can expect to find CZ shamelessly shilling his own BNB coin and promoting Binance endeavours. However, it’s the best place to go if you want to keep tabs on the biggest and fastest-growing player in the space. Once the most popular spot trading exchange, Binance is now killing it in crypto derivatives as well. Apart from self-promotion, CZ puts out plenty of gems. From central banks joining the cryptocurrency race to the fact that a US Democratic presidential candidate follows him on Twitter. There’s always something there either to entertain or provide food for thought. Central banks joining the race. Most will probably issue a blockchain-based ""mostly-centralized"" digital currency first. But the more decentralized/freedom-driven ones will win over time, pushing the race towards the end goal. Freedom of money! https://t.co/CDILgKD0LM — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) October 7, 2019 If @AndrewYang wins, we will have a US President following a #crypto guy on Twitter. Just saying, pretty cool, right? It's a new world. I am not political or anything, but I do admire hustlers. https://t.co/QkPwiKsfCi pic.twitter.com/aB548yxfUE — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) October 3, 2019 4. Vitalik Buterin Without doubt, Ethereum’s creator Vitalik Buterin needs to be in your Twitter feed. Whatever your views on the current state of Ethereum, kudos to this extremely young and slightly oddly-dressed Russian-Canadian computer genius. Well-known for his strong opinions and penchant for unicorns and rainbows, Vitalik is one of the most important crypto personalities of all. On his page, you can keep track of Ethereum goings-on from the move to proof of stake and Ethereum 2.0 to the firestorm surrounding ETH DevCon earlier this month. There’s a lot of technical information here from scaling techniques to programming languages. But you’ll also see how idealistic he is and how he genuinely wants to change the world. Rich lists should include all money you ever donated to charity (excluding political contributions) as part of net worth. It's stupid that we give rich people free extra status just for being rich and take their status away the moment they use their money to do good. https://t.co/43Kot61hM7 — Vitalik Non-giver of Ether (@VitalikButerin) September 25, 2019 Vitalik never shies away from an accusation or fight either and always responds with poise and grace. 5. Meltem Demirors Bitcoin is a male-dominated industry . Less than 5% of the industry is comprised of women. However, there are still enough intelligent and vocal female crypto personalities to be heard. One of these is Meltem Demirors, Chief Strategy Officer at Coinshares.co.uk. She’s also a cypherpunk and hardline Bitcoin bull. bitcoin fixes this 🚀 https://t.co/YgENg15sUQ — Meltem Demirors (@Melt_Dem) October 12, 2019 On her page, you’ll find Meltem educating people and pushing for adoption. You’ll also see her asking some weighty questions that may make some people uncomfortable. what is the most dystopian thing about bitcoin? what keeps you up at night? — Meltem Demirors (@Melt_Dem) October 16, 2019 6. Peter Todd As a former Bitcoin Core developer, Peter Todd is one of the most knowledgeable cryptographers in the space. He’s also one of the most vocal crypto personalities, regularly purporting the values of financial privacy. The simple reality is surveillance by those with power is a much greater danger to all of us – children and adults – than it can be used for good. We need encryption. We need financial privacy. It _will_ be used for bad things. But absolute power is used for _much_ worse. — Peter Todd (@peterktodd) October 16, 2019 He’s not an uncontroversial figure, though. You’ll frequently find Todd involved in some kind of argument on his Twitter account. Most notably, calling Ethereum a “scam” recently for being dishonest about the capabilities of blockchain. Ethereum is *worse* than Fenton's definition of a scam. Pure scams that just take money and run are less dangerous to society than ETH style dishonesty. The former are obviously bad; the latter corrode the morals of those around it. ETH makes neutral people turn bad. https://t.co/tFsmO4yKoy — Peter Todd (@peterktodd) October 10, 2019 7. Anthony Pompliano Co-founder & Partner at Morgan Creek Digital and an outspoken Bitcoin bull, Anthony Pompliano (Pomp) is one of the most influential crypto personalities today. His Twitter account almost seems manned around the clock. Pomp provides knowledge and a constant source of hopeful tweets to inspire and encourage Bitcoin enthusiasts. This Friday the 18 millionth Bitcoin will be mined. There are only #3MillionLeft Let’s make this hashtag trend so the world can learn about Bitcoin 🔥 — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) October 15, 2019 He also hosts his own podcast called Off the Chain in which he continues the dialogue with key people in the space. Wrapping it up Of course, this is just a handful of the many crypto personalities that you should follow on Twitter. Who you decide to follow will depend on what coins you’re interested in, what projects you like, and whether you want to engage in the drama of frenzied tweetstorms or prefer to learn from more serious mentors.

Meanwhile, the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency called Pepe — a meme coin based on a cartoon frog — doubled in just a few weeks. And even the price of the FTT token, which was created by the FTX exchange and currently has no real utility, has tripled in the past month on hopes that Sam Bankman-Fried’s exchange will return from the dead.
Everywhere you look, there are signs that the wacky excesses of the crypto market — and fear of missing out on them — are making an unlikely comeback. As expectations of an imminent approval of a spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded fund pushes the oldest and biggest cryptocurrency ever higher, the hype has also lifted other boats — even those considered among the least seaworthy.
This latest rise of digital junk follows a nearly two-year long crypto winter that saw the value of thousands of dubious projects slide — some to nearly zero — to the delight of critics and even some industry insiders. Aggressive actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission marked some crypto coins as illegal and chased some promoters away from crypto. Now it appears that the cleansing was only been temporary.
“As prices rise, investors on the sidelines think they need to get in,” said Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University. “Many will violate the number-one rule of investment: Understand what you are investing in. Many will also violate the number-two rule by putting their money in an undiversified bet on a single token.”
Social media is once again full of posts hyping meme coins. One of them is simply called Memecoin, which was created earlier this year and has shot up in value this month. Its short whitepaper, where disclaimers take up about as much space as explanations, notes that the token “has no functions, no utility and no intrinsic value, no promise or expectation of any financial return, profit, interest or dividend.”
“Looking for a new theme to rake in customer money for no value — that’s the theme in non-Bitcoin crypto,” Cory Klippsten, chief executive of Bitcoin services provider Swan, said in an interview. “I guarantee there will be another hype cycle for alt coins, and more people will get hurt.”
Static images of rocks tied to the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains are selling for eye-popping prices again. Bitcoin Rock #75 recently sold for almost three Bitcoin, or about $112,900. The collection, like many others, is held by a small group of people. And like most NFT collections, the rocks aren’t very liquid. Meanwhile, a slew of projects are holding NFT land sales — effectively selling NFTs of properties inside digital territories of games — even though many participants in prior-generation projects got burned.
“It’s important to note the current climate of what might be described as a mini bull market,” said Sara Gherghelas, an analyst at researcher DappRadar. “This environment has infused the NFT space with a fresh wave of enthusiasm and speculative investment, which can sometimes inflate the prices of projects that might otherwise have limited long-term value.”
TG Casino, focused on offering anonymous crypto gambling on Telegram, has raised more than $2 million in a token pre-sale, which includes selling NFTs to high rollers. In years past, people’s investments into many token sales crashed and burned.
Amid the frenetic rush into the latest hot token, some buyers end up being what’s known as rug-pulled — or duped by scams in which the coin’s creators disappear along with liquidity. In the third quarter, rug pulls accounted for 65.1% of all types of attacks in crypto, according to blockchain security auditor Hacken.io.
“Optimists are seeing thaws in the crypto winter, and even green shoots,” said Aaron Brown, a crypto investor who writes for Bloomberg Opinion. “If this really is early crypto spring, the good new ideas should suck the attention from the nonsense. If not, the junk should fade back to obscurity.”

Precigen, Inc. misses on earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $-0.13 EPS, expectations were $-0.08. PGEN isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).
Operator:Good afternoon and welcome to the Precigen Full-Year 2023 Financial Results and Update Call. At this time, all lines are in listen only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to Steve Harasym, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Steve Harasym:Thank you and I apologize for any technical difficulty here. Again, welcome to our 2023 full year financial call. With me are CEO, Helen Sabzevari; CFO, Harry Thomasian and Jim Shaffer. Please refer to our most recent filings for our forward looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Helen. Thank you.
Helen Sabzevari:Thank you, Steve, and thank you to everyone for joining us. And, again, apologies for this little bit of technical problems. But I think we are going through a very, very transformative year. 2024 is poised to be a transformational year for Precigen. We are on track to present a pivotal Phase 2 data for our lead asset PRGN-2012 in Q2 and intend on submitting our BLA in the second half of 2024. This is due in part to the positive guidance and pathway provided by the FDA and to the tireless work done by our team over the last several years, starting from discovery in 2020 all the way to the potential filings in 2024. For today's call, I will focus on our AdenoVerse platform and we are working rapidly and prudently to advance our, obviously, our UltraCAR assets and we are looking forward to the [radar] readout later on this year for UltraCAR platform, as we outline as we outlined in today's press release.
So for today, let me just jump into our AdenoVerse platform, why we are excited about this platform and our lead assets that it pays off. For those of you who might not be familiar with this platform, this is a very differentiated platform from the rest of the viral platform. Why do I say that? It's very simple. First of all, this platform is built based on the library of the gorilla adenovector. These adenovectors are not like other adenovectors. First of all, they have a high capacity that you can put number of genes in them. But more importantly, they have the ability because there is no preimmunity in humans or very little. You can keep dosing with this vector. With all of the other viral vectors, when you dose once or at best twice, you're getting this neutralizing antibody with eventually inhibited and responsive.
And then after a while, you're just shooting a blank. That's one of the major issues in the vectors, other vectors and other platforms that exist. Here, on the other hand, because we don't have preimmunity to this, you can keep on giving. And because of the design of these factors and the specific biological nature of these vectors, now even when there is a neutralizing antibody kept at bay and doesn't enhance it. Why do I say that? We have clinical data actually from in various indications that you can be dosing the patient and we have dosed some of the patients up to 18x. And not only you have kept enhancing their immune responses, but you have kept the neutralizing antibodies at bay. And finally, one other aspect of the platform, which is very important, is the specialized manufacturing process, which allows high tiders and you can imagine that becomes very important especially in commercial manufacturing process.
So let's dive into our lead asset, which is our PRGN-2012. Our PRGN-2012 has been designed to identify the epitopes HPV 6 and 11, and target the cells that are infected with this virus. Why is that important? In a rare disease of basically RRP or Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis, the root cause of this disease is the infection, HPV 6 and 11 infection in this patient, which then causes these benign tumors on the vocal cord or in the trachea of this patient. Therefore, they can’t talk or they can’t breathe or both. These patients for decades have gone through this devastating disease with really no treatment except surgery. What does surgery do? Keep removing this benign tumor, it's like mowing your grass and then they keep coming back.
And as a result, the patient, first of all, it gets worse the situation, there is a danger and there is a continuous problem that you have not solved. In the order to really address this disease, you have to get to the root, which means what? Means that you have to address the infection underlying HPV 6 and 11. And this is exactly what we designed PRGN-2012 to do to awaken the immune responses of these patients to identify these cells that are infected and cause the benign tumors to grow, and then to destroy them. And based on that, what we have done is looked at the number of the patients in United States, there are estimated between 15,000 to 20,000 patients. Ex-U.S., you are looking at excess of 125,000 patients. So as we've mentioned, this is truly a devastating disease with no current treatment.
When we started our trial with PRGN-2012, we first of all designed the trial that the patient -- we have the history of the patient in 12 months prior to receiving their vaccine. And then these patients, they receive a course of four vaccination within 85 days. And then after that, we have been following this patient to see for the recurrence of this benign tumor. In a single-arm Phase 1 pivotal trial that we run originally, what we observed was, first of all, from a safety perspective, these patients have a very favorable safety, mainly Grade 1, Grade 2, which is some rashes at the site of injection or some fever and then it resolves within a day or 2, very similar to the flu shots that you get. Secondly, one thing that was very specific about our design for this vaccine is that it's given subcutaneously in the arm or leg, again, similar to the flu shot.
We don't require any kind of a device, we don't require anything. It can be done in any office of any of these physicians, right? So now, what we saw, besides the safety and the endpoint that we had put, we decided to go to the most severe patient population. What do we mean by that? We define that and our KOLs investigators have defined that as patients that at least require three surgeries in the prior year. Actually, the average number of surgeries that our patients had in our truck was upwards of six surgeries per year. So you can imagine, every couple of months, this patient has a surgery. Some of them, they have 10 surgery in the prior year. What we observed was, after the follow-up of 12 months, 50% of these patients did not require any surgery and we refer to them as complete responder.
If we look at overall patient population that they reduce their number of surgeries, we are looking at 83% response rate, okay. Now when we look at the immunological responses of these patients, the patients that they had a complete response, they have a significant increase in their immune responses to HBV 6 and 11. And this is exactly what the mechanism of this vaccine is all about. At the same token, one thing that we have to say, we have been following now these patients for more than 12 months. Actually, these patients are in full response and they are upward of 24 months. This is two years after vaccination. And again, I'm going to stress to be a patient population with the average number of surgeries of six main average, right? So when we look at also, we have -- based on the data, the safety, the efficacy, the FDA last year for the first time in the history of any company has given us a breakthrough designation as well as accelerated path and agreed that our single-arm pivotal Phase 1 data plus a single arm Phase 2, which we had started can act as pivotal and based on that, we can submit a BLA.
So as we have mentioned, last year, we finished the enrollment to our Phase 2, and we are really excited that we will be presenting the full dataset of our Phase 2 by the end of Q2. We already have published in prior translation our complete Phase 1 data and the mechanism of action of that. And we are poised to submit our BLA in the second half of this year. And we have received an agreement from the FDA that we have enrolling BLA. So as you can imagine, this is quite exciting and also a proof-of-concept for this platform. Simultaneously, we have been advancing another molecule, PRGN-2009 and that has been already positioned in HPV 16 and 18 cancers, head and neck cancer, cervical cancer. And the Phase 2 studies in head and neck has been initiated last year, and we are currently enrolling and recruiting patients to this arm of head and neck with the early onset of the disease.
And this is quite exciting. Why? Because when you look at the head and neck, the response rate of the patients, even to the checkpoint inhibitor has been 18%. So there is a wide gap here for the improvement. Last year at ASCO, we show that when we treated HPV-related cancer patients, these are Stage 4 patients, these patients had basically -- we had 30% objective responses, partial responses, complete responses and the complete responses, they were durable. We had over a year, for instance, response in some of these patients. This is in a patient population that, I stress again, checkpoint inhibitor in cervical cancers at 15%, and then they fell for in head and neck 18%. So now positioning PRGN-2009 in a head and neck in combination with the pembro, in early onset, it's quite exciting.
And this trial is recruiting and we have enrolled patients to this arm. Simultaneously, we moved this asset towards the cervical cancer. Last year, we received an IND approval from FDA to open the Phase 2 study in combination with pembro in a relapse metastatic cervical cancer patients. And currently, as we speak, we are recruiting to this trial and this is quite exciting. So as you can imagine, this platform, with the differentiation that it has from all the other platforms, with the efficacy that has shown and in our lead PRGN-2012 were based on its safety, clinical efficacy and also in discussions with the KOL and investigators, they have high excitement about this molecule for this rare disease because of ease of administration, because of efficacy of clinical response and the durability of response has generated a lot of excitement and really has positioned us to become a leader in treatment for this rare disease.
So with that, as a highlight, I would like to now actually transfer to Harry Thomasian to give us, our CFO, an update on our financials. Harry?
Harry Thomasian:Thank you, Helen, and good afternoon to those on this call. We appreciate you participating. As Helen mentioned earlier, 2024 is shaping up to be a transformative year for Precigen. We are all well on our way to completion of our drug substance manufacturing facility here in Germantown, Maryland. And with the hiring of our Head of Commercial Operations in September of this past year, we are continuing to build out our commercial function and plan to be ready for the expected launch of PRGN-2012 in 2025. In addition, we anticipate that there will be multiple value inflection points in 2024, starting with our data readout on PRGN-2012 in the second quarter of this year. As we approached the end of the first quarter of fiscal '24, we're continuing to exercise sound financial management preparing for the planned launch of PRGN-2012 in 2025 and continuing to move our other programs rapidly through the clinic, all while maintaining efficient SG&A operations.
With that in mind, I'd like to spend a few minutes highlighting certain aspects of our financial results from 2023. In 2023, our research and development expenses were $48.6 million, an increase of 3% or $1.4 million from the prior year. This was primarily due to additional investments in our personnel, mostly through adding additional head count to support the growth in the company's development activities. Our continued focus on SG&A costs resulted in a decrease of 16% or $7.6 million from the prior year to $40.4 million for the full year of 2023. This was due primarily to reduced legal and insurance costs and was achieved while we began to build out our commercial group. We filed our 10-K with the SEC just prior to this call, and you can find more detailed financial information in the financial statements, which are included in the 10-K.
In addition, we are continuing to evaluate various opportunities in our current -- and are confident in our ability to strengthen our balance sheet as we approach the planned launch of PRGN-2012 and transitioning from a clinical to a commercial stage company. This concludes our prepared remarks for today. I'll now turn it over to the operator for any questions.

4895,2015-04-08 16:17:41,"Greece Promises To Pay, But With What Cash?","After much speculation that Greece was almost out of cash, the nationconfirmedthis week that it had enough money to make its debt payment to the International Monetary Fund on Thursday.
Athens is due to pay€460 millionto the IMF, but stalled negotiations with Greece's EU creditors had many worried that the payment would be missed. However, on Sunday, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis told IMF chief, Christine Lagarde, that Athens would pay on time.
But, How?
Many are wondering just where Greece will get that money from, as EU lawmakers are still unsatisfied with Athens' proposals of economic reform. Greece's creditors are withholding the next installment of bailout money until Athens proves that it is committed to economic reform and will make the necessary changes and stick to them.
Without the EU funding, the Greek treasury is rumored to run dry on April 9.

A New Source Of Income
On Monday, the Greek government revealed part of its plan to recoup some of that money; World War II reparations from Germany.
Greek Deputy Finance Minister Dimitris Mardas claimed in parliament that Berlin owed €278.7 billion in World War II compensation, which German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said was ""dumb.""
German officials say the war reparations claims are being used as a distraction from the nation's crippled finances and are unlikely to pay up.
Grexit Still A Worry
In any case, it is clear that Greece is strapped for cash, and the deteriorating relationship between Athens and its EU creditors is becoming worrisome for investors.
If the two don't come to an agreement soon, Greece may default and be forced to exit the eurozone.

68092,2023-03-29 13:31:13,CFTC Lawsuit Against Binance Puts Crypto Investors on Edge,"This article was originally published onETFTrends.com.
The cryptocurrency market is on edge, and rightly so, since it involves the largest crypto exchange and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The CFTC filed a lawsuit against Binance for thealleged violation of trading rules.
Based on the court filing, Binance violated provisions of a law affecting commodities that are meant to prevent money laundering and financial acts related to terrorism. Furthermore, the lawsuit contends that Binance employees and customers were instructed to work around these provisions, which corroborates withanother reportabout similar acts to circumvent rules established in China.
“This filing is unexpected and disappointing as we have been working collaboratively with the CFTC for more than two years,” aBinance spokesperson told Blockworksvia email correspondence. “Nevertheless, we intend to continue to collaborate with regulators in the US and around the world… to develop a clear, thoughtful regulatory regime.”
The news spilled over into other crypto-related stocks like digital currency exchange Coinbase. However, it could be the start of further downward pressure, unless Binance can escape the lawsuit relatively unscathed.
“Binance may choose to fight this but if the alleged facts are true, it will have adifficult time defending itself,” Blockinger told Blockworks in an email. “The issues are much less nuanced than current matters involving the SEC related to whether a particular token satisfies court-established precedent for what constitutes a security.”
The latest bitcoin rally was riding strong momentum prior to the latest CFTC news. Bitcoin pushed past the $28,000 mark before the lawsuit stifled that rally.
The leading cryptocurrency is still up over 60%, beating out other assets like the S&P 500 and gold. Bitcoin rallied further with the recent collapses in the banking system, reinvigorating its status as an uncorrelated asset with traditional financial instruments like stocks and bonds.
Nonetheless, the latest news surrounding Binance could also put downward pressure on bitcoin prices, and rightfully so, given its large market share in the crypto industry as a whole.
“Many knew Binance had a bullseye on its back, but this is still unnerving some crypto traders,” said Ed Moya, an analyst at Oanda. “Binance’s success is needed to ensure a good part of the cryptoverse can grow.”

15810,2019-07-23 21:00:35,Gold Price Futures (GC) Technical Analysis – Daily Trend Changes to Down on Trade Through $1401.30,"Gold futures weakened on Tuesday, pressured by a strong U.S. Dollar that hit its highest level against a basket of currencies since May 31. The greenback was supported by a lower Euro and British Pound.
The news that the Trump administration and lawmakers had reached a two-year deal that raises limits on government borrowing to cover spending helped support the dollar, which weighed on foreign demand for dollar-denominated gold.
At 20:44 GMT,December Comex goldfutures are trading 1430.90, down $8.70 or -0.60%.
Also contributing to the dollar’s strength was a steep drop in the Euro as investors prepared for news of fresh stimulus from the European Central Bank on July 25. Traders expect the ECB to issue dovish forward guidance and possibly more generous terms for its planned new multi-year loans. Money markets also indicated that the chances of a 10-basis point rate cut from the ECB had dropped to less than 40% from roughly 60% on Friday.
The dollar also traded higher against the British Pound after Boris Johnson won the prime minister election. Johnson has promised to lead Britain out of the European Union with or without a deal. This is known as a “hard exit”.
The main trend is up according to the daily swing chart, however, momentum shifted to the downside on Friday with the formation of a dramatic closing price reversal top at $1467.00.
A trade through $1467.00 will negate the closing price reversal top and signal a resumption of the uptrend. There is room to the upside over this level with the next major target the March 14, 2014 main top at $1532.40.
The main trend will change to down on a move through $1413.70. This is followed closely by a pair of main bottoms at $1399.80 and $1396.40.
The short-term range is $1396.40 to $1467.00. Its retracement zone at $1413.70 to $1423.40 provided support on Tuesday.
The intermediate range is $1335.10 to $1467.00. Its retracement zone at $1401.10 to $1385.50 is the next downside target.
The main range is $1285.10 to $1467.00. If the trend changes to down then its retracement zone at $1376.10 to $1354.60 will become the primary downside target.
Based on Tuesday’s price action, the direction of the market at the early Wednesday opening is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the short-term 50% level at $1431.70.
A sustained move over $1431.70 will indicate the presence of buyers. This could trigger a quick move into a minor pivot at $1447.30, followed by the main top at $1467.00.
A sustained move under $1431.70 will signal the presence of sellers. The first target is the short-term Fibonacci level at $1423.40. If this fails then look for the selling to extend into the main bottom at $1413.70. Taking out this level will change the main trend to down.

“I’ve seen a lot of weird coins likedogecoinand evenXRPhave huge retail spikes, which means there’s a lot of frenzy right now,” bitcoin bull and CEO of Galaxy Digital Mike Novogratztold MarketWatch. “That never ends well, and so we’ll probably have a washout at one point.”
The U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase’s shares (COIN)went liveon Nasdaq on Wednesday, rising as high as $429.54 before closing the day at $328.

Being the crypto market leader, bitcoin broke out of its multi-week consolidation below $60,000 in the days leading up to the highly anticipated listing widely touted as a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry and clocked a record high of $64,801.79 on Wednesday. Corporate treasury money has been flowing into bitcoin mainly via Coinbase.
“In hindsight, bitcoin printing a new all-time high on the day shares the opened for trading was a bit of an obvious one. You could even attribute some of the price appreciation this week squarely to this much-anticipated event,” crypto exchange EQUOS said in its daily market analysis email.
However, XRP, dogecoin and few other cryptocurrencies also rallied despite not being listed on Coinbase. XRP picked up a bid near $0.6 on April 5 and clocked a three-year high of $1.9 on Wednesday – a 220% gain in nine days. Dogecoin has surged by 85% in the past three days.
As per Novogratz, that shows Coinbase’s listing on Nasdaq created a lot of euphoria – a point of maximum financial risk where investors, primarily retailers, think good times will continue unchecked. It’s usually the time when the market sees a temporary correction.

According to Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital, the market is now seeing a classic sell-the-fact reaction to the news. Bitcoin, XRP and others have pulled back from the highs seen on Wednesday.
“It’s quite common for a market to run up in anticipation of an event before then selling off on the news itself,” Kruger told CoinDesk, adding that the cryptocurrency may track COIN in the short-term.
Coinbase’s shares witnessed a two-way business or indecisive price action on the first day of trading, as noted earlier. If the share price drops in the coming days, the cryptocurrency may test $58,820, according to Equos.
Dips, however, are likely to be shallow. “I would expect buying interest, detached in mindset from the noise of the day, to arrive and happily soak as weak hands leave the market.” Equos’ analyst noted.
According to Kruger, the focus would soon shift back to the bigger picture and macro drivers. Data released earlier this week showed the U.S. headlineinflation roseto a 12-month pace of 2.6% in March, strengthening the case for continued investments in store of value assets such as bitcoin and gold.
“All those narratives are still true, and there’s a lot of money on the sidelines, especially in the institutional world that has not been deployed yet,” Alex Svanevik, the CEO of blockchain data company Nansen told CoinDesk. “I don’t see a reason for a big correction.”
Novogratz also remains bullish on bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole and foresees bitcoin at $500,000 by 2024.

TheBTC/USD indexis currently trading at the 4513-fiat price level after a minor jump from its intraday low at 4035-fiat. The knee-jerk reaction after a massive sell-off does not confirm a substantial bias shift. It looks more like a bear pennant formation that is likely to extend the bearish action as it overreaches its downside targets.
The little rise we are looking at could just be traders closing their short positions. It doesn’t guarantee any substantial accumulation. The BTC/USD rate, therefore, could consolidate for a while before forming another bearish flag, this time targeting new supports for a potential reversal.
Indeed, the world’s leading digital currency is behaving like a recklessaltcoinafter weeks of stability. It doesn’t leave retail investors with any choice but to wait for things to settle down. Analysts arecalling the bottomlike they always do, but real accumulation could only appear when big-pocket bullsbuy the dip. The events taking place in thebitcoin cash marketare leaving investors no choice but to wait.
Our intraday analysis, therefore, can only provide for day traders willing to catch the falling knife. Approach with caution.
As BTC/USD forms a bearish pennant, we are testing its levels as a sign for out breakout/breakdown targets. That said, a jump above the upper trendline could have us enter a long position towards 4797-fiat. Similarly, slipping below the lower trendline could allow us to watch 4313-fiat as our short target. In both places, we are maintaining our stop losses tightly — just 2-pips opposite the direction of the price action would be enough to define our risk management perspective. Period.
A weekly chart provides us with a better outlook of how bitcoin could behave in the future. With Bakktdelaying its launch, the market has every reason to test the lower trendline of the falling wedge pattern. That somewhat coincides with levels around $3,500, a prophesied bottom. Breaking below it would put pressure of calling bulls on 2982-fiat, a level that had a decent historical significance during the August-September 2017 session.
Meanwhile, the RSI is already oversold, and the Stochastic Oscillator could join the club if BTC/USD dips any further. The RSI, in particular, has never been inside the oversold area, barring the initial days of trading. Traders can be hopeful of a recovery — but not sure.
The technical definition of a falling wedge pattern also indicates a breakout session to the upside. Therefore, the BTC/USD pair should consolidate inside the range and ultimately attempt a breakout to as high as 7500-fiat.
Until then, we are speculating highly on the events from the mainstream space. Weak dollar, interest rate hike,bitcoin ETF,Bakkt, and even afinancial meltdown— the holders have enough reason to speculate on the market that is just maturing.

87254,2025-02-04 17:21:46,White House crypto czar to share strategic priorities for industry,"The White House is set to overhaul years of crypto policy on Tuesday, as U.S. crypto czar David Sacks plans to hold a press conference aimed at reinforcing America’s leadership in the global crypto sector.
The event is expected to outline Sacks' key priorities for the digital asset industry, including the Trump administration’s goal of establishing the U.S. as a global leader in the space. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump appointed Sacks as chair of a new working group on digital assets, tasked with creating a regulatory framework for the crypto industry. The group is set to release a report this year covering topics such as stablecoins, market structure, oversight, and investor safeguards.
Sacks, a South Africa-born entrepreneur and member of the “PayPal mafia,” has already hinted at his stance on crypto in aninterviewlast month: “You’ve got digital assets that are securities, you’ve got digital assets that are commodities, you’ve got digital assets that are collectibles like NFTs or meme coins. So, you’re talking about a whole vast area of innovation,” he said.
“Fresh from his assertion that NFTs and memecoins should be classified as collectibles rather than securities, Sacks is expected to discuss how this perspective could reshape the regulatory landscape,” Alan Orwick, co-founder of Quai Network, told TheStreet Crypto.
Orwick also suggested that the event might outline plans for a U.S. sovereign wealth fund incorporating digital assets. This follows Trump’s Mondayannouncementof a sovereign wealth fund — an initiative some in the crypto industry believe could serve as a vehicle for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency investments.
However, others warn of the risks associated with crypto in such a fund. “There is one significant issue: excessive crypto volatility,” Arthur Azizov, CEO of B2BINPAY, told TheStreet Crypto. “The crypto market remains extremely ‘shallow,’ with speculative traders outnumbering long-term institutional investors, such as BlackRock, MicroStrategy, and Fidelity. To overcome this, crypto needs a thorough legislative framework.""
Sacks will be joined by Congressman French Hill, the new chair of the House Financial Services Committee, who has publiclyrecommendedinvestigating Operation Chokepoint 2.0 — an alleged attempt to restrict U.S. banks from offering services to crypto firms.
“I wouldn't be surprised if this announcement assures banking access as a key item and also communicates that we'll have proposals for market structure within the next six months,” Joe Doll, General Counsel for Magic Eden, told TheStreet Crypto. However, the likelihood of a plan for a strategic bitcoin reserve seems early, Doll added.
The event will alsoincludeSenate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman, and House Agriculture Committee Chairman G.T. Thompson.",99052.45,0.01,98972.63,-0.07,99046.5,0.01,99222.41,0.18,99039.8
11671,2015-07-02 03:47:00,Peak Venture Group Adopts the BitShares Network,"Peak Venture Group has announced the adoption of the BitShares 2.0 platform to integrate into their existing business
LAS VEGAS, NV / ACCESSWIRE / July 1, 2015 / ""We're always looking for game-changing opportunities,"" smiled Steve Tiffany, CEO of Peak Venture Group. ""BitShares has the potential to supercharge most of our existing businesses and revolutionize everything about how we start new ones.""
The Las Vegas based startup incubator has big ambitions that leverage remarkable synergies in the crypto currency, ATMs, remittance, video gaming, and network marketing industries. ""BitShares turns out to be the missing catalyst needed to stimulate viral growth across our whole portfolio,"" said Tiffany.
Mr. Tiffany went on to discuss his reasoning for the adoption.
""Our original killer concept was to bring together a network of merchants and affiliate marketers by helping them to connect with each other in a double-sided marketplace. Merchants are always looking for ways to sell their products and affiliates are always looking for lucrative new things to sell. We put together a system that helps them find each other. We already have over 17,000 members on our video game site and 8500 marketers in our affiliate system the first year. Whoosh!""
""Then one of those affiliates introduced us to BitShares,"" said Tiffany, shaking his head. ""I thought it was just going to be a way to maybe make commission payments within our network a bit more automatic and trust-free. But after talking with BitShares Founder Dan Larimer, I realized his brainchild was going to change everything we do!""
""What exactly is it that we do?""
""We provide specialized training for an affiliate marketing force and broker connections to all kinds of products they'll find easy to sell. Then we go looking for startup companies with ideas worth investing in, and hand them a marketing outlet on a silver platter! Most startups focus on their products and services, leaving marketing as an afterthought. We deliberately invest knowing that we can add a powerful engine for customer acquisition on Day One. We look for startups that fit into that model, and then harness our marketing horsepower to their front end.""
""Take for instance the market we put together for the gaming industry,"" he said. ""And I'm not talking gambling or anything like that. When we say gaming, we're referring to the video game community. One aspect I'm talking about is the Massively Multi-Player Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG) - video games in which a very large number of players interact within a virtual game realm. It's a $65B industry world wide!""
""We created two symbiotic companies. Our gaming eCommerce store is one-stop shop for everything to do with video games, including ACME laser swords, valuable game items, rare related merchandise, gold, you name it. Then our affiliate program teaches gamers how to do their own viral network marketing of everything that we sell while preserving the gaming atmosphere for our affiliates to keep the fun intact. We motivate the industry's most passionate expert gamers to become its most productive marketers. They wind up building their own game and financial empire at the same time! And we do so by seamlessly integrating real world and game world currencies and empires.""
""You can see how this led us naturally to crypto currencies, and ultimately to BitShares,"" he traced a finger from dot to dot, as if the connection was obvious.
Tiffany further explained, We needed a way to seamlessly transition real world currencies like dollars and euros and the unique digital currencies used inside many of the games we offer at the gaming site. I figured we could integrate a crypto currency wallet somehow and use that currency as the common denominator and a way to automatically pay affiliate commissions.
But BitShares gave us a completedecentralized currency exchange networkright out of the box. It even had built-in smart contracts to help automate our affiliate program. This helps us make sure every affiliate gets paid automatically for every transaction made by any member of her integrated game and financial empire. And BitShares can keep up with gaming speeds - Its average transaction time is about a second compared to, say, Bitcoin where it can take the better part of an hour to confirm a transaction. Gamers can't wait that long to get more ammo for their hypersonic reciprocating transmorgifyer when they are pinned down and really, really need it!
No other cryptocurrency had all that. It completely changed how we now think about all of our start-ups.""
He then said, ""We plan to use the same model to integrate the crypto universe,"" he waved as if it were a done deal. ""Our Chief of Acquisitions and Visionary Officer, Justin LaFountain, has been spearheading a whole new crypto currency venture maybe even bigger than gaming. Its flagship website will soon debut as a one-stop education and shopping site for everything about crypto. The ultimate goal is to introduce new arrivals to the freedoms of the crypto universe and help spread that freedom across its physical and virtual counterparts. We hope that will lead to many loyal customers.""
""Originally, we thought crypto-evangelism meant teaching people about Bitcoin, how to get and use crypto currencies, wallets, mining support, and understanding the leading exchanges. But by integrating the industrial grade BitShares Exchange Network directly onto our web sites, there's much more value we can add.""
After a series of annoucements over summer of 2015,BitShares now has a network of complementary partners like CCEDK.com, BANX.io, Cryptonomex.commaking the fusion of all our crypto-savvy products and services available to each other's customers. Transparently interoperable markets and freely interacting customers will exponentially magnify our combined network effect.
When asked about what it all means in the end forPeak Venture Group, Steve broke it down to what reqally matters to his company.
""Bottom line, our competitive edge as a startup incubator was to integrate affiliate marketing into every one of them. BitShares' smart contract services, financial products, and internal affiliate program will greatly amplify that. It all works together to turn existing customers into affiliate marketers and existing affiliate marketers into uber-productive affiliate mentors.""
Clearly inspiring himself, his gaze drifted off to the horizon, ""Peak Ventures Group can leverage these same BitShares Exchange Network relationships to supercharge every Group of new Ventures we Peak!""

53465,2021-11-11 15:29:36,Elon Musk Cleverly Dumps Nearly $6B in Tesla Stock,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk Getty Images Sure enough, Tesla ( TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk has sold about $5.8 billion worth of stock in the world's largest automaker by market value so far this week  just days after asking in a Twitter poll whether he should do so. But it looks like investors can finally stop worrying. After a couple days of deep price declines  likely fueled in part by the mercurial billionaire's sale threats  TSLA stock at least appears to have found its footing. SEE MORE 12 of the Best Stocks You Haven't Heard Of Given that the electric vehicle stock carries significant weight in scads of basic market-index funds held by most investors, that's an encouraging development. Musk's Stock Sales Confirmed Over the weekend, Musk conducted a Twitter poll asking followers whether he should sell 10% of his stake in TSLA stock, and promised to abide by the results of the poll. The majority  some 3.5 million followers, or 58%  voted ""yes."" But it seems likelier than not that the Twitter poll was just a stunt heralding something Musk already had planned. ""Today Musk owns roughly 21% of Tesla and it was viewed by many on the Street that he would sell up to ~5%/6% of his ownership stake before the Twitter poll fiasco began,"" says Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. Either way, Musk made good on his promise. Regulatory filings made public late Wednesday revealed that Musk exercised options Monday and then sold about 2.1 million of the TSLA stock he received to raise $1.1 billion in cash to pay taxes stemming from the transaction. Interestingly, the option exercise and sales were pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Insiders are required to adopt such plans so as to not run afoul of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The trading plan was filed with the SEC on Sept. 14, or well before Musk's infamous Twitter poll of Nov. 6. SEE MORE How Do I Spend My Bitcoin? (And Where?) It's also worth noting that the options were not set to expire until August 2022. Exercising options early is actually a bullish move on Musk's part, notes Barron's Al Root : Story continues ""It's important to remember that Musk had no looming bill from the options exercise. The tax is due only when the transaction happens. And Musk exercised the options before he had to, making it a bullish trade in theory. Exercising options early and holding the stock bought is better, for tax purposes, when an options holder believes a stock is going up. That's because the tax rate on options exercise is the tax rate on ordinary income  and the tax rate on long-term capital gains is lower than the rate on ordinary income."" But let's not digress, because Musk's sale saga hardly ends here. After exercising options on Monday, Musk undertook a series of sales on Tuesday and Wednesday, per regulatory filings. In those trades, the chief unloaded 3.5 million TSLA shares worth nearly $3.9 billion. Then on Friday, following our original story, new filings showed that Musk unloaded another $687.3 million worth of shares. These transactions, however, were not made under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. That is, they were not scheduled sales. Shares in Tesla tumbled more than 19% from the close on Friday, Nov. 5 through its intraday low on Wednesday, Nov. 10. Pressure from Musk dumping nearly $5 billion worth of Tesla stock into the market  and the uncertainty created by his Twitter poll asking if he should sell 10% of his total holdings  likely didn't help. The pain caused by this selloff wasn't limited to holders of TSLA stock. With a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion, Tesla has a great deal of sway in cap-weighted indexes  the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, for example  and scores of exchange-traded funds, such as the Invesco QQQ Trust ( QQQ ). Tesla has an outsized effect on consumer discretionary funds, as well. For instance, it accounts for more than 19% of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund's ( XLY ) $23 billion-plus in assets. In other words, even investors who don't hold TSLA stock directly have skin in Musk's game. Encouragingly, shares in Tesla began to stabilize Wednesday and continued to do so Thursday and Friday. Tesla stock chart YCharts What Now for TSLA Stock? For those worrying about Musk bailing out on his baby, the world's richest man still holds more than 167 million shares of Tesla stock, or roughly 16% of the electric vehicle maker's shares outstanding. Vanguard is the distant No. 2 shareholder, holding 5.9% of the company's outstanding stock. SEE MORE 10 Metaverse Stocks for the Future of Technology Make of that what you will. And to reiterate: Musk's options exercise and sales were planned well in advance of his Twitter stunt  the point of which remains elusive to anyone but the Tesla chief. To be fair, Musk's quick but precipitous sale of TSLA stock might have been the best course of action for Tesla's CEO. ""With 10% being a higher amount that surprised some investors, ultimately it's a digestible number we are not overly concerned about, although it has given fuel to the bears pressuring the name this week,"" Ives says. ""In a nutshell, we would rather Musk rip the band-aid off now and sell this portion of stock quickly rather than it lingering over the next year and feeding into any non-fundamental bear thesis on the story."" Will Musk make good on selling even more of his stake? That's anyone's guess, but the bullishness he showed by exercising options early suggests it's probably one of his goofs. The bottom line is there is no bottom line. We can only hope the billionaire feels sated by his latest jape, and whatever whim that follows causes less consternation for both TSLA stock and the broader market.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including AbbVie Inc. (ABBV), Square, Inc. (SQ) and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
You can seeall of today’s research reports here >>>
AbbVieshares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry in the year to date period (+10.2% vs. -0.1%). The Zacks analyst believes that AbbVie’s key drug, Humira is seeing strong demand trends in the United States.
AbbVie has been successful in expanding labels of its cancer drugs, Imbruvica and Venclexta. It gained approvals for two new drugs with significant potential, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, in 2019. Both are off to a strong start. Allergan’s acquisition has diversified AbbVie’s revenue base into new therapeutic areas, enhancing its long-term growth potential.
However, sales erosion due to direct biosimilar competition to Humira in international markets is a big headwind.  Also, the decline in hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug Mavyret’s sales is a concern.
(You canread the full research report on AbbVie here >>>)
Shares ofSquarehave gained +183.4% over the past one-year period against the Zacks Internet - Software industry’s rise of +85.7%. The Zacks analyst believes that Square’s comprehensive commerce ecosystem, accelerated business growth and entry into bitcoin space remain major positives.
Notably, strong momentum in online channels and growing card-not-present GPV are expected to be tailwinds. Moreover, robust online products, such as Square Online Store, Invoices, Virtual Terminal and eCommerce API are expected to accelerate the GPV growth in the near term.
However, uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic remain concerns. Higher investments and increasing product development expenses might hurt margins. Intensifying competition and foreign exchange fluctuations remain headwinds.
(You canread the full research report on Square here >>>)
Honda Motorshares have underperformed the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry in the year to date period (-1.6% vs. +12.8%). The Zacks analyst believes that in anticipation of a slowdown in India and North America, the company expects sales to decline year over year in fiscal 2021.
With the coronavirus pandemic wreaking havoc on the auto industry, sales and earnings of Honda is likely to suffer a major blow, going forward. Further, high capex to develop advanced technologies may also limit its cash flows.
However, the firm’s frequent collaborations with companies like General Motors and Hitachi, among others, are expected to expand business and bolster prospects. Its healthy balance sheet, improving cash flows and investor-friendly moves are other positives.

Is Bitcoin a currency, or is it an investment like gold? Can it be both? We explore that idea and suggest where it might be going.
There are three fundamental values to describe what money is, and what it does.
• 🏦It’s a store of value - you can save it and use it for later, knowing its value will remain.
• 💱It’s a medium of exchange - something we use to buy and sell things that everyone accepts.
• 📝It’s a unit of account - a way to measure the value of goods and services.
It's important to understand this as it helps define howBitcoinis currently perceived. In places where adoption is low, it doesn’t satisfy any of the above.
In areas where adoption is high, it can tick all three of the what is money boxes. On a global scale, thanks to Bitcoin’s growth in value, it satisfies the criteria that the currency can be a Store of Value.
Bitcoin’s original purpose - as laid out in the original paper published bySatoshi Nakamotowas to be a decentralised payment method.
What Satoshi wanted was to create a medium of exchange - a way to buy and sell goods.
There are more than 100,000 websites worldwide that accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.
However, as the popularity of Bitcoin has increased, its ability to serve as a quick, free way to transfer money has become hindered. Transaction fees and the number of transactions that can be handled at once by the network has made Bitcoin seem less viable as a medium of exchange.
Read more about that in our articleBitcoin’s Limits. However, countries like Japan, Russia and Norway all accept Bitcoin is a currency.
TheLightning Networkcould fix many of the above issues.
Thanks to Bitcoin’s amazing performance in 2017, many came to see the currency as a place to put cash and watch it grow. Like an investment.
Many have compared it to gold. The Winkelvoss twins - those guys who invested in Facebook - described Bitcoin as Gold 2.0. However, gold as an investment is regarded as somewhere safe to put your money when currencies aren’t faring so well.
Bitcoin’s price volatility makes its suitability as a safe haven questionable. But that could change.
As part of Bitcoin’s design, the amount of Bitcoin available increases in number at a rate of approximately 4% per year. It’s engineered to slowly decline to zero growth around the year 2140.
Bitcoin’s diminishing growth rate and finite quantity are comparable to gold in that sense. What’s more, Bitcoin’s volatility compared to other cryptocurrencies is lower - meaning it has potential to become the gold of crypto.
One possible idea for where Bitcoin could be heading is for it to become a tradeable commodity, like oil, or metal. In America, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission designated Bitcoin as a commodity in 2015.

Banks like JP Morgan are now seeing the currency as an asset class, too. But that doesn’t mean it’s a done deal for Bitcoin.

69750,2022-07-08 11:45:57,XRP Leads Recovery Among Major Cryptocurrencies; Fed Policymakers Back 75 Basis Point Hike,"Major cryptocurrencies recovered over the past 24 hours and broader equity markets strengthened even as two U.S. Federal Reserve policymakerscalled for higher rate increasesin the coming months.
XRP rose more than 5%, leading gains as bitcoin broke $22,000 in early Asian hours on Friday. Market capitalization almost touched the $1 trillion mark, reaching levels last seen in early June before systemic risks from within the crypto market and a bleak macroeconomic outlook led to steep declines.
Bitcoin (BTC) traded at about $21,600 at publication time, extending weekly gains to more than 10%. ether (ETH) added 3%, while Solana’s SOL, Cardano’s ADA, and BNB showed nominal gains.
Some analysts, however, remained neutral about prospects of a longer-term bitcoin recovery considering the sentiment in broader equity markets.
“The only bitcoin bottom signal for me is persistent data showing us that inflation is convincingly inflecting down,” said Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at crypto broker GlobalBlock. “This should result in the Federal Reserve becoming less aggressive with their monetary policy, and therefore provide confidence that the liquidity crisis in the crypto market is over.”
However, in separate comments on Thursday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard backed higher rate increases in the coming months even at the cost of slower growth.
Higher rates would increase the chances of a recession as consumers spend less, potentially hurting the prices of equities as companies miss revenue targets.
That would likely feed through to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Crypto assets have tracked growth and declines in the broader equity markets in recent months.
“We need to move to a much more restrictive setting in terms of interest rates and policy, and we need to do that as quickly as possible,” Waller said Thursday during a webcast hosted by the National Association for Business Economics.
“I am definitely in support of doing another 75-basis-point hike in July, probably 50 in September,” Waller said, adding that a 25-basis-point hike could then be in the cards after that. Concerns that the Fed would tip the U.S. into a recession were overblown, he said, and added that he saw a “good shot” of the economy having a soft landing.
“I think it would make a lot of sense to go with the 75 at this juncture,” Bullard said. “I’ve advocated and continue to advocate getting to 3.5% this year. Then we can see where we are and see how inflation’s developing at that point.”",21642.21,0.04,21617.69,-0.08,21676.94,0.2,21221.01,-1.91,21634.59

(OTC Pink: SFLM), (""SFLMaven"" or the ""Company"") (www.sflmaven.com), a leading provider of high-end luxury goods, is pleased to announce that the Company has begun the process of accepting Bitcoin (“BTC”) for purchases of high-end vintage jewelry items both in the real world and digitally within the metaverse.
The Company has also begun to diversify its cash and cash equivalents holdings to include scaling exposure to BTC as a line item in its recorded holdings of assets.
“We believe in the future of Bitcoin and digital payment systems and that fiat currency systems represent a risk to the productivity of assets on the balance sheet because they are subject to monetary expansion, stimulus, and debt, which could continue to drag down value,” commented Joseph Ladin, CEO of SFLMaven. “As such, we have begun to diversify the Company’s exposure on the cash side with periodic investments in Bitcoin.

59582,2022-08-04 19:54:09,What is the video app Flip and why is Addison Rae on it?,"Influencers are flocking to a new social media platform called Flip, dedicated entirely to beauty and commerce. Bitcoin ETFs: What are they and how to invest in them? Flip first hit the app stores in 2019 and touts itself as the “No. 1 beauty shopping app.” The e-commerce service just snagged $60 million in Series B funding with a valuation of $500 million. Meanwhile, Flip has grown its users by 500% and its in-app transactions by 600% in 2022. So you can expect to hear more chatter about the app soon. Symone reflects on the epic year she's had since winning ""RuPaul's Drag Race"": Especially now that major beauty gurus and internet personalities like Addison Rae , Hyram Yarbro, Patrick Starrr, Angel Merino and Ariel Tejada are using Flip. What is Flip? Flip allows influencers and content creators to share video reviews of their favorite beauty products. Users can then shop the influencer’s favorite products with free same-day shipping and easy returns. The app also has features like live shopping shows and a way to earn rewards. Why use Flip? The app advertises itself as an easier way for beauty lovers to earn money. Every video posted is automatically monetized so that users can earn commissions on views and products sold. Considering Rae is the co-founder of Item Beauty, it makes sense she would want to be on the platform. Why are influencers and celebs using Flip? According to Glossy , the influencers joined the app after discussions between Flip and their managers and agents. However, Flip does not pay influencers to join or post. “This is only the beginning of a string of big celebrities that we’re hoping to onboard over the next three to four months,” Flip CCO Peter Wingsoe told Glossy . Singer and About-Face founder Halsey hosted the company’s official launch party in December 2021, which might foreshadow the kinds of celebs the app hopes to court. While Addison Rae may have only posted one video so far, when it comes to blowing up on social media, all it takes is one viral video .

31593,2018-05-13 12:48:00,One-Third of Americans Have This Little in Retirement Savings,"We're told of the importance of saving for retirement, especially given the wayhealthcareand other senior living costs continue to rise. But apparently, a large number of workers aren't listening. In fact, one-third of Americans have less than $5,000 set aside for the future, according tonew data from Northwestern Mutual. Incidentally, 21% of Americans have no retirement savingsat all.
It's one thing to have less than $5,000 in your nest egg when you're only in your 20s or even 30s. But if you've been in the workforce for quite some time, that $5,000 doesn't paint a great picture. And if you don't take steps to ramp up, you'll be sorry for it later on.
IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.
Many workers don't save for the future because they assume they can live on Social Security. But that's a dangerous,misguided assumption. In a best-case scenario, Social Security will replace about 40% of the average earner's pre-retirement income. Most seniors, however, need double that amount to live comfortably.
Even if you're willing to cut corners in retirement, you can only slash so many basics. You'll still need a roof over your head, a way of getting around town, and food on the table. Therefore, a frugal lifestyle might allow you to get away with spending abitless than 80% of your former earnings, but not much. That means that while your Social Security income will help cover the bills when you're older, you still will need a nice amount of savings to avoid falling short.
It's not just an overreliance on Social Security that causes so many workers to neglect their savings. For many, it's a matter of misplaced priorities. Most adults would rather spend their paychecks on living expenses and luxuries than part with a portion of their income to save for the future. But people whodon'tare taking the risk of struggling financially in retirement.
If you've been having a hard time setting money aside because your bills monopolize your entire paycheck, there are a few things you can do to eke out some savings. First, examine your budget (orcreate oneif you're not following one already) and identify at least a few non-essential costs you can cut. That could mean canceling your gym membership, downgrading your cable plan, or eliminating restaurant meals, which cost far more than cooking at home.
Additionally, consider working aside hustleif your regular salaryreallydoesn't allow for much savings. Putting in just a few hours a week of additional work could spell the difference between building a nest egg and entering retirement with absolutely no money to your name.
Finally, make a point of saving your raises year after year, as well as any bonus cash that comes your way. If your salary increases by $2,000 a year, on average, from which you take home $1,400 after taxes, and your living costs only rise by $400 simultaneously, there's no reasonnotto put that extra $1,000 into your IRA or 401(k).
If you've been discouraged from saving thus far because you can't get anywhere close to maxing out your IRA or 401(k), don't be: You can establish a healthy nest egg by setting aside just a few hundred dollars a month -- that is, if you give yourself a long enough savings window. The following table further illustrates this point:
[{""25"": ""30"", ""$932,000"": ""$620,000""}, {""25"": ""35"", ""$932,000"": ""$408,000""}, {""25"": ""40"", ""$932,000"": ""$263,000""}, {""25"": ""45"", ""$932,000"": ""$165,000""}]
TABLE AND CALCULATIONS BY AUTHOR.
As you can see, setting a mere $300 aside each month over a 40-year window will leave you with well over $900,000 in savings. But if you only give yourself half that amount of time, you'll retire with just $165,000. Then again, $165,000 is far better than the $5,000 or less that one-third of Americans currently have saved.
Finally, if you're at a point in your career where retirement isreallylooming and you have nothing saved to date, don't give up on building that nest egg. Workers 50 and over can contribute up to $24,500 a year to a 401(k) and $6,500 a year to an IRA. Hit either limit for the last half-decade of your career and you'll be in much better shape for retirement than a $5,000 nest egg will allow.
Remember, Social Security will only get you so far in retirement; it's on you to come up with the remaining income you'll need. Do your best to save for the remainder of your career, no matter how long that is, and you'll be thankful for it in the long run.

BITCOIN CASH (BCH) SLIPPING FROM ITS INTRADAY HIGH | SOURCE: COINMARKETCAP.COM
The fourth-largest cryptocurrency set an intraday high at $324.80 following the Asian market open.
Unsurprisingly, BCH demonstrated an inverse trajectory to bitcoin SV (BSV). As some of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges announced that they woulddelist the controversial cryptocurrency, thebitcoin SV priceplunged by 23-percent. At the same time, the bitcoin cash price appreciated more than 10-percent against the dollar.
One straightforward theory suggested that crypto traders were dumping BSV for BCH, and social media sentiment seemed to bear that out. On exchanges, both cryptocurrencies experienced large volumes against tether (USDT), which could indicate that funds were flowing from one to the other.
Hong Kong-based OKEx, whichrefused to delist BSV, was the top spot trading platform for both BSV and BCH. The crypto exchange hosted almost 8.9-percent of the total BSV volume. It also hosted 10-percent of the overall BCH volume. That proves that both the assets shared an interim inverse relationship in terms of price action.

49664,2021-01-07 12:11:42,How bitcoin narratives have evolved to fuel current price surge,"If the running joke of the late 2017 bitcoin price surge was the image of families discussing crypto around the Thanksgiving dinner table (“Grandma, you should buylitecoin!”), the theme of the late 2020 run has been Wall Street hedge fund runners and billionaire investors going on television to say some form of, “I was wrong.”
In the past year,Paul Tudor Jones said he has put 2% of his portfolio in bitcoinand predicted that as new cryptocurrencies proliferate, bitcoin will become even more distinct as the “precious crypto.”Stan Druckenmiller said he has bought bitcoin, and predicts his “bitcoin bet will probably work better” than his gold bet “because it’s thinner, more illiquid and has a lot more beta to it.” Ray Dalio, one month after saying on Twitter that he sees three major problems with bitcoin, including the potential for governments to “outlaw” them,reversed his tune, now saying bitcoin “could serve as a diversifier to gold” and that investors ought to “have some of these types of assets.” Jamie Dimon, three years after calling bitcoin a “fraud... worse than tulip bulbs,” now says bitcoin is merely “not my cup of tea” and acknowledged that “very smart people” are investing in bitcoin. His bank in 2020 partnered with multiple major U.S. bitcoin exchanges.
In 2020, Wall Street warmed up to bitcoin. So did big consumer-facing payments names likePayPalandSquare, two brands with more mass recognition and legitimacy than, say,early crypto adopter Overstock.com.VisaandFidelityare some of the other major financial names that have partnered with crypto startups or dipped into crypto in other forms, if not quite as loudly as PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ).
The COVID-19 pandemicprovided the spark. With central banks pulling levers and printing stimulus checks, bitcoin’s long-hyped appeal as “digital gold” and a hedge against inflation became more convincing than ever before. “There’s so many uncertainties in this pandemic, but one thing that seems almost assured is when you print trillions of dollars more paper money, it’s going to drive up bitcoin and other cyptocurrencies,” Dan Morehead, CEO of crypto firm Pantera Capital,said in August.
Bitcoin took more than 10 years tohit $20,000on most exchanges (since cryptocurrency is traded on multiple exchanges, there israrely one consensus price). Then it leaptfrom $20,000 to $30,000in a little over two weeks. It topped $35,000 four days later.
Since its inception, the bitcoin market has always been fueled by narratives.
After events like the FBI shutting down Silk Road in 2013 (an online black market site that used bitcoin as its payment) and the theft of 850,000 bitcoins from Mt. Gox in 2014 (an early bitcoin exchange that filed bankruptcy shortly thereafter), bitcoin was for yearsdogged by a stigmathat it is unsafe, subject to theft, and favored by hackers and scammers.
Crypto diehards adopted the retort that the U.S. dollar is used for crime too, but it didn’t do much to combat bitcoin’s association with cybercrime. Over the years, Nouriel Roubini called bitcoin the “mother of all scams”; Jamie Dimon called it “fraud”; Saudi Arabia’s Prince Alwaleed called it “Enron in the making”; and Charlie Munger of Berkshire Hathaway called it “disgusting... stupid... turds.”
The image of bitcoin as vaguely fraudulent lingered, but bitcoin andether(the token of the Ethereum blockchain, launched in 2015, and the No. 2 cryptocurrency by market cap) both eventually enjoyed a boost in legitimacy compared to the junky,meme-based coinsof the ICO boom.
Amid bitcoin’s dramatic surge in 2017, fledgling tech startups flocked to a new funding method: the initial coin offering, in which a company creates and sells its own digital token to raise instant capital without begging at the feet of venture capital firms. Token sales began in 2014, but intensified with the rise of Ethereum andpeaked in Q4 2017, with investors buying $3.4 billion worthof newly created coins,more than three-quarters of them from companies that had no productand had done nothing apart from sell the token.
Then 2018 brought the ICO bust, as theSEC widened its crackdown on companies that conducted token salesandrepeatedly made clear its view that the vast majority were unregistered securities offerings. (At a Yahoo Finance summit in 2018, an SEC officialdeclared that the agency does not view bitcoin and ether as securities; XRP, the token created by Ripple Labs, iscurrently facing a $1.3 billion SEC suit over this same distinction.)
With the ICO frenzy largely in the rearview, and with the largest U.S. crypto exchange siteCoinbase planning to go public this year, the bitcoin market may be entering a new phase of maturity. The hope among crypto investors: “This time is different” from 2017.
Wall Street investment firms pumped a total $5.75 billion into crypto funds in 2020, up 660% from 2019, according to acrypto inflows reportfrom CoinShares. That flood has boosted Grayscale Investments, the largest crypto asset fund, to $20 billion in assets.
The surge has brought theoverall crypto market cap above $1 trillion for the first time. This week, trading volume across the major cryptocurrency exchanges hit a new daily record of $68.3 billion,according to CryptoCompare, suggesting an extremely active (if also volatile) trading market. The blockchain research firm Glassnode estimates so much bitcoin is being held by long-term institutional investors thatjust 22% of existing bitcoin is in circulation for trading, which could mean increased volatility.
But with maturity comes regulation.
Last month, FinCEN (the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, an arm of the U.S. Treasury) proposed new, tighter customer information rules for crypto wallets. Companies that hold customer crypto funds were quick to voice their displeasure. Squarereleased a statementsaying that the new rules “would not only hamstring law enforcement capabilities, but also limit American innovation by hindering our ability to create a competitive service that allows customers to seamlessly transfer and transact in crypto.” Coinbase and the powerful VC firm Andreessen Horowitz plan to fight the rules in court. Separately, this week the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a different bureau within Treasury) declared that federally chartered banks are free to embracestablecoins, cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the price of the fiat currency like the U.S. dollar to limit volatility. (Facebook’s intended Libra token, now rebranded Diem, is a stablecoin.)
Wall Street firms may welcome regulation as a sign of seriousness, but regulation is at odds with the original appeal of bitcoin to its earliest adopters (many of whom were libertarian): that it’s outside government reach and control, unregulated, no middleman. This push and pull is yet another narrative that will continue and intensify in 2021 and beyond, as the bitcoin investment market matures.

93447,2025-04-01 10:28:52,"Bitcoin Nears $85K Before Tariffs Kick-In; DOGE, XRP, ADA Lead Crypto Majors","Bitcoin (BTC) was inching towards 85,000 during European trading hours on Tuesday as traders largely await the impact of U.S. tariffs slated for Wednesday.
Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) rose over 7% to lead muted gains among majors, with ether (ETH), XRP, Solana’s SOL and BNB Chain’s BNB were up nearly 5%.
Overall market capitalization decreased 3%, CoinGecko data shows, with the broad-based CoinDesk 20 bumped 3% in the past 24 hours.
The movements come amid a broader risk-off mood gripping markets, with U.S. equities stumbling — the S&P 500 logged a 3% drop last week, its worst since September 2023, and a rush to safe-haven asset gold, which surged to fresh highs early Tuesday.
The looming tariffs, paired with a flurry of U.S. economic and labor reports covering the past month have cast a shadow over crypto sentiment. Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, pointed to a lack of fresh catalysts — such as no big ETF inflows — and a market stuck in low-conviction mode to close out a rocky quarter, one that ended in an 11% loss for bitcoin and the biggest for the S&P 500 since Q2 2022.
https://x.com/Barchart/status/1906821431352029565
On the futures front, speculative positions on bitcoin via the CME are at their most bearish in years, a sharp pivot from January’s bullish fever, Fan said.
“Keep in mind that positioning data is merely a statement on the market condition, and not necessarily a signal to a tradeable setup,” Fan said. “The catalysts for a sustained rally remain fleeting at the moment, though we would expect any bullish turn to be sharp given the extended short positioning at the moment.”
But there are signs of resilience among long-term holders.Glassnode datashows holders with 3-6 month positions are sitting on growing profits and trading at their lowest levels since June 2021 — a sign of conviction over panic selling.
Newer whales, or large investors who’ve taken positions in recent months, are also holding firm rather than cashing out, lending stability to bitcoin’s price floor, per Glassnode.

• Market angst over US inflation, the global economic outlook, and Fed monetary policy weighed heavily on the crypto majors throughout the weekend.
• The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index saw a modest decline this morning despite bitcoin falling for a sixth consecutive day.
On Sunday, bitcoin (BTC) slid by 6.35%. Following a 2.3% decline on Saturday, bitcoin ended the week down 11.1% to $26,587.
A mixed morning saw bitcoin strike an early morning high of $28,519 before hitting reverse.
Falling short of the Major Resistance Levels, bitcoin slid to a final hour low of $26,571.
The reversal saw bitcoin fall through the First Major Support Level at $25,932 to end the day at $26,500 levels.
Following the US inflation figures on Friday, market sentiment failed to improve over the weekend.
The latest spike in US inflation supports a more aggressive interest rate path for the Fed to curb inflation.
Market conditions did not improve this morning, with investors looking ahead to the Fed monetary policy decision and projections on Wednesday.
Today, the Fear & Greed Index fell from 14/100 to 11/100. The modest fall came despite the extended crypto sell-off that saw bitcoin fall to sub-$25,000 for the first time since December 2020.
While sitting deep within the Extreme Fear zone, the Index avoided May’s low of 8/100.
Following last week’s close correlation with the NASDAQ 100, the futures market weighed on bitcoin early this morning.
Concerns over China’s demand for crude oil weighed on WTI crude oil prices, softening bitcoin’s inverse correlation with WTI, however, as shown by the chart below.
At the time of writing, the NASDAQ 100 Mini was down 357 points, pointing to a bearish start to the US session. WTI Crude was down 1.95% to $118.32.
At the time of writing, BTC was down 7.00% to $24,726.
A bearish morning saw BTC slide to a morning low and a current-year low of $24,586.
The extended sell-off saw BTC slide through the First Major Support Level at $25,932 and the Second Major Support Level at $25,274.
BTC will need to move through the Major Support Levels and the $27,227pivotto target the First Major Resistance Level at $27,878.
BTC would need the broader crypto market to support a return to $27,500.
An extended rebound would test resistance at $29,000 and the Second Major Resistance Level at $29,174.
Failure to move through the Major Support Levels and the pivot would leave the support at $24,000 in play. In the event of an extended sell-off, bitcoin could test the Third Major Support Level at $23,334 before any recovery.
Looking at theEMAsand the 4-hourly candlestick chart (below), it is a bearish signal. Bitcoin sits below the 50-day EMA, currently at $28,831. This morning, the 50-day EMA slid back from the 100-day EMA. The 100-day EMA fell back from the 200-day EMA, bitcoin price negative.
A return to $27,500 would give the bulls a run at the 50-day EMA. Near-term, however, price action remains in the hands of the Fed.

67666,2023-02-02 16:50:23,Giant Bitcoin 'Taproot Wizard' NFT Minted in Collaboration With Luxor Mining Pool,"Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today
Independent developer Udi Wertheimer claims he minted a giant image of what appears to be a bald, bearded wizard donning sunglasses and promoting “magic internet JPEGs” on the Bitcoin blockchain via the Ordinals protocol.
His announcements in the Discord channel “taprootwizards.com” and on Twitter sparked further flames of division between Bitcoin purists and Ordinals proponents. The block that minted the non-fungible token (NFT) was mined by bitcoin mining firm Luxor Technologies, which said it was “the largest Bitcoin block” ever mined.
Battle lines were drawn when the Ordinals protocol, which stores non-fungible tokens on Bitcoin, launched on the dominant blockchain last month. That showdown created two factions – purists who insist on using bitcoin (BTC) exclusively for payments and Ordinals fans who welcome NFTs, including this “Taproot wizard” sketch that nearly filled an entire 4 megabyte (MB) block, incurred no transaction fees (although a premium off-chain fee was likely paid) and left Bitcoiners of both stripes mystified.
The image itself is a throwback to anearly Bitcoin memefeaturing a similar wizard, crudely rendered in MSPaint, inviting all and sundry to “Join us” on the then-popular r/bitcoin subreddit.

Bitcoin transaction blocks are capped at 4MB, while individual transactions are limited to 1MB unless a user directly approaches a miner to process a larger non-standard transaction (like the wizard NFT) that fills an entire block. The image, which was a massive 3.94 MB, had many Bitcoiners asking: Who would go through the trouble of processing this non-standard NFT mint (or “inscription” in Ordinals lingo) and why?
Earlier Thursday, Wertheimer tweeted about the Taproot wizard, stating that “we made history” and linking to the Taproot Wizards Discord channel. The channel contains a Jan. 31 announcement message from Wertheimer alluding to the future minting of the Taproot Wizard.
He and Luxor CEO Nick Hansen collaborated to ensure the Taproot wizard NFT was included in a block mined by Luxor, according to a Luxor spokesperson.
Amid much online criticism, Luxor Chief Operating Officer Ethan Vera tweeted the company views the Taproot Wizard as “short term R&D” as it looks to maximize the revenue potential for both the company and its clients.
""Luxor's payout method is based on a full-pay-per-share model, meaning miners get paid an equal market rate for their hashrate based on the total value of bitcoin and transaction fees mined in a given timeframe,"" Colin Harper, head of research and content at Luxor, told CoinDesk.
""Miners are paid the same regardless of how many (or how few) blocks Luxor mines in a given timeframe. As such, any transactions that weren't included in the NFT block would have been included in subsequent blocks and the variance would even out. This block did not affect miner compensation.""
Veteran Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr, who vehemently opposes having Ordinals on Bitcoin, says he’s developed a rudimentary “spam filter” that screens forinscriptionsand prevents them from being relayed through the Bitcoin network. An inscription is when arbitrary content (like text or an image) is added to sequentially numbered satoshis (sats) – the smallest units in Bitcoin – to create unique “digital artifacts.”
Critics of Ordinals argue that NFTs will compete with traditional payment transactions by crowding blocks and driving up transaction fees.
Casey Rodarmor, creator of the Ordinals protocol, disagrees but isn’t fazed by Luke’s new invention. In fact, he welcomes it.
“It filters inscriptions from an individual Core node’s mempool,” Rodarmor told CoinDesk. “I actually told him how to look for inscriptions to filter them.”

10810,2017-12-28 12:02:00,Bank of America Has Bought Back 290 Million Shares So Far in 2017. Should Investors Be Happy?,"When it comes to returning capital to shareholders,Bank of America's(NYSE: BAC)dividend tends to get the most attention. This is especially true after 2017's massive dividend increase that prompted Warren Buffett to finally exerciseBerkshire Hathaway's warrants to buy 700 million shares of Bank of America's common stock.
However, dividends are a surprisingly small part of the bank's capital return strategy. The majority of Bank of America's capital return is in the form of share repurchases. In fact, the bank spent nearly $8 billion on buybacks through the first three quarters, and there's reason to believe that this number will swell when the year-end results are released.
Image source: Bank of America.
Through the first three quarters of 2017, Bank of America returned $10.7 billion to its shareholders, and as I mentioned, most of this came in the form of share repurchases. In fact, the bank spent $7.9 billion of this amount on its buybacks.
At first glance, the math may not make it look like Bank of America has repurchased any shares at all. There were 10.05 billion shares outstanding at the beginning of the year and 10.46 billion at the end of the third quarter. However, remember that700 million new shareswere issued to Berkshire Hathaway, so by subtracting these, you see that there are 290 million fewer shares outstanding now, excluding the effect of Berkshire.
Bank of America has really accelerated its buyback program in recent years. The bank expects to return $14.2 billion to shareholders in 2017, with most of this amount coming from buybacks. In 2016, the bank returned less than half of this amount.
And this may actually be a conservative estimate. In fact, since the bank revealed this estimate, management has announced that $5 billion is beingadded to the current buybackauthorization, which runs from July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018. The bank previously planned to buy back $12 billion in stock during that time period, so this translates to a 42% increase.
To be fair, the reasons for Bank of America's emphasis on buybacks don't all have to do with management believing the stock is cheap.
As I discussed in a recentpodcast, another advantage to buybacks (from a company's standpoint) is that they're much more flexible than dividends. In other words, if it cuts its dividend, it generally results in a wave of negative headlines and speculation that the company must be struggling. Meanwhile, if it reduces its buyback rate, few shareholders would even notice.
Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan has specifically said that the company will continue to favor buybacks over dividend increases for this very reason. Investor perception of Bank of America's financial health is just starting to become positive, and a forced dividend reduction could be a disaster. On the other hand, the bank could easily decide to buy back fewer shares next year without much repercussion.
Having said that, management has said that it also believes its shares are a good value, and largest shareholder Warren Buffett has voiced his agreement. Moynihan has said that ""our stock's a good buy and we'll continue to buy it until the cows come home."" And Buffett, who famously advocates holding stocks for long periods of time,has saidthat ""We (Berkshire) will be holders of BofA stock for a long, long, long time.""
So, as a Bank of America shareholder myself, I'm happy that the bank is aggressively buying back shares and intends to continue doing so for the foreseeable future.

86225,2024-02-08 13:56:00,Bitcoin Sees Price Volatility: 3 Stocks to Buy on the Dip,"The cryptocurrency market had a solid 2023 and the rally gathered further momentum in December, which led to a great beginning this year. On Jan 10, the crypto space witnessed a historic event as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in a major reform, approved the creation of 11 spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
The decision was widely expected and largely responsible for the December Bitcoin rally. Following the approval, Bitcoin prices soared further, rallying past $47,000. However, Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, has been on the decline since then.
By the end of January, Bitcoin price had fallen sharply and was hovering around $39,000. However, some of the loss has been pared, and Bitcoin traded just above $43,000 on Feb 7.
Nevertheless, Bitcoin still holds a lot of potential and the Federal Reserve’s upcoming rate cuts are likely to boost the cryptocurrency market. The Federal Reserve said that a rate cut in March is unlikely, but multiple rate cuts are happening this year for sure. Markets are pricing in at least three 25-basis point rate cuts in 2024.
Lower interest rates generally have a positive influence on growth-oriented sectors, such as technology, consumer discretionary industries and cryptocurrencies.
Also, the SEC’s latest decision is going to boost the crypto space in the long term as it will push cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance.
Also, the next Bitcoin halving, projected in the first half of this year, is expected to reduce the mining reward for new blocks by half. This event historically enhances scarcity, posing a greater challenge for miners to acquire net Bitcoins and potentially leading to an increase in Bitcoin's value due to decreased supply.

29609,2018-05-01 20:18:26,‘Drunk on Bitcoin Nonsense’: Anti-Crypto Short Seller Pounds the Table on Square,"Squareshares took a brief hit Monday after noted short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research said interest over its recently introduced bitcoin trading product was exaggerated, according toCNBC. The app lets customers trade BTC from their mobile payment app almost instantaneously, which is an attractive feature for traders.
In a Monday afternoon tweet, Citron said Square is a “collection of yawn businesses,” adding “WallSt. drunk on Bitcoin nonsense. SQ-Cash to BTC trading has been insignificant. Even w/ hyper growth still 40% too rich.” Citron also set a short-term price target of $30 on the stock, or 36.9 percent below Friday’s close.
Square’s stock briefly lost 3.8% as the price fell to $45.76 before recovering much of the loss to close only 0.48% lower. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Shares remain little changed since Square, run by Twitter co-founderJack Dorsey, launched bitcoin trading in January for most of its Cash mobile payments app users.
Also read:Bitcoin helps Square’s stock bounce
Dorsey is a bitcoin bull who believes it will surpass fiat money and emerge as the “single currency” of the world and internet over the course of the next decade.
Dan Dolev, Nomura Instinet research analyst, reiterated his position that bitcoin’s impact will be “material” in the long run. Square got a boost a week and a half ago when Wall Street analysts said BTC trading would bolster the company’s quarterly results.
Dolev raised his price for Square to $65 on April 18, believing that launching bitcoin trading could contribute 10 percent to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Dolev expected Square could experience a “sizeable boost” to its top-line and bottom-line results in the current quarter, which the company reports on May 2. He said between 2% and 6% of Square Cash customers trade BTC, which could bolster Square’s adjusted revenue by as much as 3%.
Left in December said he believed theBitcoin Investment Trust(OTC: GBTC) represented one of the easiest — and most profitable — short opportunities, regardless of what happens to the bitcoin price.

58617,2021-11-18 07:00:05,Environmentalists sound alarm at US politicians embrace of cryptocurrency,"Photograph: Marco Bello/AFP/Getty Images The incoming mayor of New York City thinks cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are the future. Eric Adams has advocated to reshape the city into a crypto hotspot, with crypto being taught in schools. He also plans to take his first three paychecks in bitcoin payment. Adams said in an interview that bitcoin was the new way of paying for goods and services throughout the entire globe and that schools must teach the technology behind it, as well as this new way of thinking. Related: Bitcoin price surges to record high of more than $68,000 Hes not alone in America. The mayor of Miami announced in February that the city plans to accept tax payments in bitcoin and let employees draw their salary in the cryptocurrency. Crypto conferences like Bitcoin 2021  billed as the biggest bitcoin event in history  have chosen Miami as their host city because the area has rolled out the red carpet for this industry. But not everyone is onboard with the crypto giddiness being expressed by Americas political class. Mining cryptocurrency is notoriously environmentally unfriendly, and in an era of rapid climate crisis, increasing the use of the technology could be hazardous. According to Digiconomist, a single bitcoin transaction uses the same amount of power that the average American household consumes in a month  which equals roughly a million times more in carbon emissions than a single credit card transaction. And globally, the carbon footprint of bitcoin mining is greater than that of the United Arab Emirates and falls just below the Netherlands. People should be concerned about the environmental and climate impacts of proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining such as bitcoin, said Benjamin A Jones, an economist at the University of New Mexico. The mayor-elect of New York City, Eric Adams, is an enthusiastic supporter of cryptocurrency. Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty Images Such currencies require miners to compete to validate transactions on their blockchains, and that takes enormous, power-hungry servers. Bitcoin mining uses energy predominantly generated from fossil fuels, which creates air pollution and carbon emissions, said Jones. Story continues These pollution emissions are harmful to human health outcomes and the carbon emissions lead to climate damages, he added. Jones recently co-authored a paper that estimated that in 2018 each $1 of bitcoin value created was associated with $0.49 in health and climate damages in the US  meaning that the negative human health costs and climate impacts of bitcoin mining in the US were roughly half as large as the per-coin value. This is a tremendous negative externality of bitcoin mining that is imposing significant societal costs on all of us, he said, even on those who do not use bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. Since mining crypto requires so much power, it is often situated near the cheapest, least-regulated sources of energy. The damages Jones and his colleagues pinpointed arise from increased pollutants generated from the burning of fossil fuels used to produce energy. Exposure to pollutants such as fine particulate matter has been linked to increased risk of premature death. Last month, a group of 70 climate, economic and racial justice groups wrote a letter to Congress urging leaders to address the climate implications of cryptocurrency. The letter cites the extreme levels of carbon emissions, energy consumption and electronic waste generated by cryptocurrency usage, production and mining, especially the deeply energy-intensive proof of work process used by the two largest cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ethereum. Crypto-related mining already has an impact on local communities such as Seneca Lake, New York, and Limestone and Jonesborough in Tennessee, through environmental destruction, noise pollution and plummeting property value, the letter says. Residents say that Seneca Lake has heated up so much due to the increased power demand that the lake feels like a hot tub . The power plant there is already increasing its carbon emissions, up almost tenfold in 2020 . Texas has a problem too. After Chinas crackdown on bitcoin mining, many miners moved to Texas, where the electrical grid is deregulated. Environmental groups say the extra pressure on Texass grid could cause more blackouts of the sort that happened in February, when households were plunged into dark and freezing circumstances. Other places around the country are restarting coal-fired plants to power bitcoin mining. A banner with the logo of bitcoin at the cryptocurrency conference Bitcoin 2021 Convention in Miami. Photograph: Marco Bello/AFP/Getty Images Cryptocurrencys destructive impact on the environment is just another example of how corporations in a financialized economy will stop at nothing to create profits for investors, and how communities of color will ultimately pay the price, Erika Thi Patterson of the Action Center on Race and the Economy wrote in the letter. Cryptocurrencies and their miners rely on harmful fuels like coal that produce toxic emissions linked to asthma, cancer, acid rain, and climate change. In doing so, cryptocurrency is exacerbating decades of environmental racism and fueling climate chaos. The deputy legislative director of the Sierra Club, Patrick Drupp, said: It is beyond absurd that, as we speak and as the climate crisis only deepens, fossil fuel power plants are having their lives extended and even reopened in order to virtually mine cryptocurrency. At a time when financial regulators ought to be doing everything possible to help tackle the climate crisis, its clear that the status quo of letting bitcoin and other cryptocurrency miners pollute our climate and communities at an exponential rate is unsustainable, unwise and in need of urgent action. Embracing cryptocurrencies means that Americas political leaders and policymakers must confront the environmental and climate damages generated through mining operations, says Jones. For bitcoin in particular, one cannot embrace the coin without also acknowledging its impacts on the environment.",59774.73,0.06,59686.54,-0.09,59654.15,-0.15,59772.92,0.05,59741.16

14436,2018-01-21 16:11:00,These Analysts are Bullish on Netflix Going into Earnings. Should You Follow?,"Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ: NFLX)is scheduled to report the results of what is typically a seasonally strong fourth quarter, as well as its full-year results on Monday, Jan 22. In the weeks leading up to the event, analysts have been busy issuing reports and prognosticating on potential outcomes to what many believe will be among Netflix's strongest results yet. Investors have high-hopes for the streaming pioneer, having run its stock price up 55% in 2017.
In the last two weeks, a number of analysts have initiated coverage or raised their price targets on Netflix in advance of the company's earnings release.
Should investors follow their bullish predictions and buy the stock heading into its results?
Will streaming industry leader Netflix beat its own forecast? Image source: Netflix.
In conjunction with itsthird quarter earnings, Netflix provided its forecast for the fourth quarter. The company believes it will add 21.75 million net new streaming subscribers year over year, increasing its total to 115.55 million. This includes 4.59 million domestic additions and 17.16 million international subscribers compared to its 2016 fourth quarter. This would result in 23% year over year subscriber growth, with a 9% gain in domestic subscribers and a 38% gain internationally.
A Morgan Stanley team led by analyst Benjamin Swinburne has the most bullish stance on Netflix, with a price target of $255, about 16% higher than its recent price. They cite three factors as drivers for Netflix going forward. First, they believe that the acceleration in subscriber growth produced between 2016 and 2017 still remains potent. Second, the company was able to grow its average revenue per user (ARPU) by 10%, which the analysts see as an indication of Netflix pricing power. Third, they cite evidence ofoperating leveragethat will likely result inmargin expansion.
Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays recently initiated coverage on Netflix, setting it target price at $245, 11% higher than the current stock price. The analyst lists several reasons he thinks Netflix will continue to grow, citing its virtuous cycle as the most critical. The combination of scale resulting from Netflix's worldwide distribution and consumer inertia will play a vital role in that thesis. Venkateshwar also cites pricing power, a huge, untapped ""international total addressable market,"" management's track record and its ability to execute, and the potential for strong ""longer-term operating leverage.""
What does analysis from the top minds in the stock market reveal? Image source: Getty Images.
PiperJaffray analyst Michael Olson has a price target of $240, 9% higher than its recent price. His team uses proprietary research and analysis of Google search trends to predict a 9.3% year over year domestic subscriber gains and 38.7% international growth, similar to Netflix's own forecast. Olson goes further, estimating that Netflix will grow its total subscriber base to about 168 million worldwide by 2020. He cites increasing ARPU, international growth, and an increasingcontribution marginas factors. Netflix has long said that its domestic contribution margin will reach 40%. Olson believes that the company will achieve that goal by 2020, and eventually attain that internationally as well.
With a trailing twelve month price-to-earnings ratio that sits at a nosebleed-inducing 220, and a 68% gain by the stock over the last year, any real or perceived failure by Netflix to deliver the goods could result in a double-digit percentage correction following its earnings report.
Here at The Motley Fool, we advocate a long-term buy and hold approach to investing, rather than jumping into or out of a stock ahead of earnings. Netflix has shown that it has a domestic model that was successful over the long-term and the company is in the process of implementing that model worldwide. It's a formula that has posted results for years and I don't see why that will change in the next couple quarters.
Whether or not Netflix achieves these analyst goals next week is less important than if the company is setting the foundation to succeed for years or even decades to come.I believe it is.

33739,2021-12-26 02:04:51,Ripple’s XRP Price Prediction for 2022,"2021 was a particularly bullish year for Ripple’sXRPand the broader crypto market. A number of the crypto majors, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) struck new all-time highs late in the year.
Increased adoption and greater market awareness of NFTs, the metaverse and Web 3.0 drove the market cap from a January year-low $736bn to a November year high $3,009bn. The total crypto market cap stood at $2,380bn at the time of writing.
Demand for alt-coins were also on the rise with Bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance taking a hit. BTC dominance had stood at 73.63% in January before sliding to a 2021 year low 39.56% in September. BTC dominance stood at 40.1% at the time of writing.
According toCoinMarketCap, XRP is the 7thlargest crypto, with a market cap of $43.77bn. XRP had sat at the number 3 spot for a significant period of time before losing ground.
The fall from the number 3 spot came in spite of XRP surging by 319% in the year. Others have simply done better, with theSEC lawsuit against Ripple Labpinning XRP back from larger gains.
Binance Coin (BNB), now ranked 3rdby market cap, is up 1,356% for the year, with Cardano’sADA(ranked 6th) up691%. Solana (SOL), currently ranked 5thby market cap, is up by an impressive 12,764% for the year.
In January 2021, XRP’s had fallen from a previous year high of $0.7872 to a Jan-2021 low $0.2108. Finding support from the broader market, XRP struck a 2021 year high $1.9660 in April before sliding back to $0.50 levels.
The SEC lawsuit against Ripple Lab led to the sell-off. Late in the year, however, hopes of a favorable settlement with the SEC saw XRP test resistance at $1.00.
The SEC action against Ripple Lab and two executives alleges that over $1.3bn was raised through an unregistered, ongoing digital assets securities offering. Key to the claim is that the SEC classified XRP as a security. This was in contrast to ETH. In June, the SEC had stated that ETH offers and sales are not securities transactions. The announcement supported an ETH run to an ATH $4,868 in November.
XRP’s market cap, now sitting at $43.77bn had recovered from a Jan low $10.78bn to reach a year high $83.51bn before falling back.
The markets are bullish for the year ahead. Much, however, will depend upon the outcome of two lawsuits.
A claim of bias against the SEC filed byEmpower Oversight, a non-profit government watchdog, will be key. Empower Oversight claims that SEC officials were biased against Ripple Lab and XRP. A verdict in favor of Empower Oversight would give the SEC more reason to close out the claim against Ripple Lab, which should favor XRP.
Such an outcome to the claims could see XRP breakout from its January 2018 ATH $3.35. Some are talking of hitting $5.00 levels in the year. An unfavorable outcome, however, would have a devastating impact on XRP and XRP holders. While torn, the markets have been more optimistic than earlier in the year.
Aside from the outcomes of the two lawsuits, broader crypto market movements will also influence, however. A bearish year for the crypto markets could see XRP fall back to $0.50 levels. The downside risk to the broader crypto market remains greaterregulatory oversight.

The company’s OKLink subsidiary will work on “public security and social governance” blockchain applications, according to a companypress release. An OKLink representative told CoinDesk the partnership aims to tackle money laundering, not everyday policing.
Despite China’s crackdown on cryptominingand trading in the past year, blockchain technology remains a government favorite. Blockchain was declared a strategic technology in China’s latest Five Year Plan, issued in March.

OKLink and Nanjing’s Public Security Bureau will set up a research and development lab focused on on-chain data analysis, risk control and talent training, the statement said.
The lab takes its name from Oklink’s flagship security product, Chaintelligence, a tool that can help track down illegally obtained crypto. The companysaysthat Chaintelligence has already helped police in five Chinese provinces crack “dozens” of cases, successfully recovering 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) of assets.
Chinese police authorities are “very motivated” to bust crypto scams and track illegally obtained funds because they can make money for their departments, Chinese reporter Colin Wu noted on Twitter.
Founded in 2013 by OKEx founder Mingxing “Star” Xu, OK Group owns crypto exchange Okcoin, one of the largest in China. Last month, Xufiledto close Okcoin’s Beijing company.

95089,2024-04-01 14:07:00,Best and Worst ETF Zones of Q1,"Global stock markets wrapped up one of the best quarters, with the MSCI index of world shares rising 7.7%, its best performance in five years. Hopes of a soft economic landing in the United States and enthusiasm about artificial intelligence drove the stocks higher.Notably, the S&P 500 Index logged the best first-quarter performance in five years, having gained 10.2%, while the Dow Jones had its strongest first-quarter performance since 2021, advancing 5.6%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index popped 9.1% (read: 5 Best Stocks That Powered the S&P 500 ETF in Q1).Bitcoin and the related stocks were the hottest throughout the first quarter amid growing optimism about the tokens. The energy sector led the gains in March. On the commodity side, gold regained sheen on expectations of upcoming U.S. interest rate reductions. Traditionally viewed as a safe haven during periods of economic uncertainty, gold's appeal has surged given the forthcoming U.S. presidential election and conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. Silver and other precious metals also gained.In agriculture commodities, cocoa prices have more than doubled in just three months, skyrocketing to $10,000 a ton from $3,000 a ton at the start of the year. A third consecutive year of supply shortages caused by poor harvests in West Africa led to the surge.Given this, we have highlighted three ETFs, each from the best and worst-performing zones, in the first quarter of 2024.
Bitcoin - Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) – Up 92.5%Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has been on an unstoppable rally as the demand for the token is widening beyond committed digital-asset enthusiasts following the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs.

It trades in a volume of 17 million shares a day on average.Roundhill Cannabis ETF (WEED) – Up 45.1%Cannabis stocks and ETFs have been on a surge on speculations over the potential reclassification of marijuana as a less dangerous drug. A reclassification could potentially expand the market for marijuana, which is a multi-billion-dollar industry in the United States and a cash crop in many states where cannabis has been newly legalized (read: Cannabis ETFs Jump on Imminent Rescheduling News).Roundhill Cannabis ETF is designed to offer concentrated exposure to the largest U.S. cannabis companies.

54403,2022-04-29 20:37:06,Plowing Through Earnings Season with a Bullish Outlook,"Where there are earnings reports, there is usually volatility.
We’ve echoed this sentiment for the last few weeks, but by the end of this week, we’ll have more than one-third of the expected earnings reports, which should give us an idea what to expect from the market in the near future.
Earnings have been good because companies have been able to pass along price increases to customers. In turn, customers continue to buy, and demand seems strong. However, inflation still looms, and the speculation of whether or not this trend will continue in Q2 is tripping up the market… which is a familiar story.
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
This is the exact situation we were in during January’s earnings season. The numbers were good, demand was strong, and the outlook was positive, but investors were worried that inflation would ruin things in the first quarter, so stock prices remained low. It’s a vicious cycle.
Taking all that into account, inflation expectations do seem to be easing a little this week. If commodity prices continue to decline, then expectations for inflation should drop even further, which is why the tech sector is leading the market.
With or without a change in inflation expectations, we think that tech is undervalued. This week, we’ve had our eye on tech companies likeMicrosoft(NASDAQ:MSFT) announcing better-than-expected earnings.
The question at this point is whether investors will continue to bet against the market fundamentals and keep prices low… or if the market will rally.
Gold prices are declining again, along with most energy basic commodities. While this might be disconcerting for “gold bugs,” this is actually a good sign for the stock market because of the impact it will have on inflation expectations.
From a technical perspective, a break of support in the gold market should trigger the next rally in theS&P 500.
What’s next for gold and the rest of the market?

Perhaps it doesn’t seem like it, but this earnings season has been successful in comparison to other recent quarters’ reports. According toFactset, 79% of companies who have reported earnings so far have exceeded expectations, including top tech companies, on which we’re still bullish.
Economic headwinds that continue to threaten the market still exist, of course, including looming inflation and rising rates in the 10-Year Treasury Yield (TNX), which is approaching 3%.
When the TNX is moving higher, it shows that traders believe the economy is growing and that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may need to raise interest rates to keep inflation in check. The Fed likely will continue raising rates, as it has been for some time.
The S&P 500 (SPX) has found support around 4,165 and is currently bouncing up off this level, but we are primarily focused on support at 4,114.65 — the low set on Feb. 24 — for the long-term performance of the S&P 500 (see below).
If this level can hold, the S&P 500 has a good chance of consolidating between support at 4,114.65 and resistance at 4,650 during the rest of Q2.
What’s all this mean for you? Basically, if the S&P 500 doesn’t hold, we may have to start looking at the possibility of the S&P 500 reaching bear-market territory during 2022.
We’ll keep you updated on its progress.
This earnings season, we have been waiting on four of the large market-cap stocks in the S&P 500 that could potentially lead the rally higher. Last night, Microsoft andMeta Platforms(NASDAQ:FB) did help boost the S&P 500, butApple(NASDAQ:AAPL) andAmazon(NASDAQ:AMZN) may not cooperate today.
Yesterday, we saw that during after-hours trading, Apple dropped down. While the numbers they reported were fantastic (blowing the doors off earnings and revenue expectations) it is their guidance for the current quarter that has everyone concerned. Can these four stocks revive the index and help send the stock market higher? Check out thereplay of last night’s livestreamto take a closer look at their earnings reports and what they could mean for the market.

95036,2024-04-01 04:10:00,Best cryptocurrency exchanges and trading apps in April 2024,"While cryptocurrency has surged in popularity in recent years, only a minority of Americans have actually traded it. Among themost popular cryptosareBitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano, each of which has seen a lot of action as prices rise and fall. The appeal for traders? The potential to make significant money on the volatility of these highly speculative assets.
Increasingly, traders have more and more ways to accesscryptocurrencies. New exchanges and trading platforms have started in response to the wide interest in crypto. In fact, you may already have an app on your phone that lets you trade. For example, if you have the PayPal or Venmo apps, you can buy and sell at least a few different cryptocurrency coins. But other apps and exchanges give you access to a wider selection of cryptocurrency — there are literally thousands — or they offer other benefits such as lower cost.
Below are some of the top apps and exchanges for crypto trading and some of the key things you need to know.
The platforms below include specialized crypto exchanges,online brokers, and cash and payment apps. We’ve included pricing as well as how many coins you’re able to trade, so you can get a sense of the scope of each app or exchange.
If you’re interested in trading the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, exclusively, it may not make sense to go with an app that offers you dozens of other coins. On the other hand, if you’re looking to trade whatever is hot at the moment, consider an app or exchange with more variety.
Binance.US, which is the American arm of the larger Binance organization, is one of thebest crypto exchangesbecause of its low trading costs. Bitcoin traders can access commission-free trades, while other coins are priced on a sliding scale for high-volume traders. Plus, if you use Binance’s in-house coin, BNB, to pay trading fees, you’ll get a discount of 5 percent.
You’ll also be able to trade more than 150 different cryptocurrencies at Binance, so you shouldn’t have any trouble finding what you’re looking for, especially if you just want to trade the most popular coins.
TheSEC sued Binance in June 2023, alleging that it had illegally operated as an exchange, broker-dealer and clearing agency and offered and sold unregistered securities. The lawsuit also accused Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao of misusing customer funds. SEC Chair Gary Gensler warned of using Binance platforms, while Binance said customers’ assets are safe.
In November 2023, Binance and Zhao pleaded guilty to separate federal charges and agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines. Zhao also agreed to step down as CEO of Binance. The SEC’s case is ongoing.
• Cost:Free for Bitcoin, but fees for less-common coins start at 0.57 percent and decline for high-volume traders. A 5 percent discount is available if you pay trading fees with BNB.
• Coins available to trade:More than 150 coins including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano and more
Coinbaseis a specialized cryptocurrency exchange that allows you to trade a bunch of digital currencies, hundreds at the latest count. That range will likely scratch your crypto itch, since it includes most of the top coins, including Bitcoin, of course. But what will you pay for using the basic service? Unfortunately, Coinbase has become cagier about what you’ll pay to trade, recently obscuring the fee structure on its website.
When it was visible, the fee structure was complex, to say the least. You’d pay a spread markup of about 0.5 percent and a transaction fee that depended on the size of the transaction and the funding source. For Coinbase Advanced Trade, you’ll pay fees that start at 0.6 percent for 30-day volume under $10,000 and decline to as low as 0.15 percent for up to $100,000 in volume and then head even lower.
TheSEC sued Coinbase in June 2023, alleging it had illegally operated as an exchange, broker-dealer and clearing agency, and offered and sold unregistered securities. The lawsuit said Coinbase knowingly violated securities laws that are designed to protect investors. Coinbase said it would continue to operate its business as usual.
• Cost:Typically at least 1.99 percent (lower with Coinbase Advanced Trade)
• Coins available to trade:Hundreds, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano and Solana
The brokereTorois all crypto, all the time (at least for American traders, though others can trade stocks). At eToro, you’ll have access to about 25 cryptocurrencies, including quite a few, such as Tezos, Uniswap and Polygon, that you won’t normally find on the traditional brokerage apps. The app doesn’t charge a direct commission but rather a flat spread markup of 1 percent, regardless of which coin you purchase or how much.
• Cost:Commission-free, but spread markup of 1 percent
• Coins available to trade:25 cryptos, including Bitcoin, Ethereum,Dogecoinand more
Krakenis another specialized cryptocurrency exchange that lets you trade a ton of different coins, including the most popular as well as some (Solana, Uniswap, Cardano and more) that are not typically available on the usual financial apps. In total, the exchange supports trading in more than 230 cryptos. Kraken does not offer its service to residents of New York and Washington state.
Commissions on Kraken Pro are competitive, ranging from 0.16 to 0.26 percent at the lowest volume levels and declining to a range of 0 to 0.1 percent with volume of $10 million or more in the last 30 days.High-net-worth traderscan also accessmargin trading, increasing their buying power (and risk). While you can deposit money via ACH for free into Kraken, debit or credit card transactions incur a 3.75 percent fee plus 25 cents, and you can get hit with a 0.5 percent online banking processing fee if you fund through a bank, at last check.
In November 2023, the SEC charged Kraken with illegally operating an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer and clearing agency. The SEC alleges that Kraken’s business practices, including commingling customers’ money with its own, presents a significant risk to customers. Kraken disputes the allegations and is fighting the charges in court.
• Cost:Fees start at 0.26 percent, plus fees for cards and online banking
• Coins available to trade:236 of them, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and Uniswap
You may knowRobinhoodfor its slick trading app for stocks, options and ETFs, but it’s also expanded into cryptocurrencies. Plus, it brings its no-commission structure to the crypto world. Although trading may look free, Robinhood charges a spread markup rather than a direct commission, meaning that the costs are built into a coin’s buy or sell price. You can get started almost immediately with Robinhood’s instant transfer feature, so it’s just download and go.
• Cost:$0, or commission-free, but there’s a spread markup
• Coins available to trade:15 of them (some aren’t available in all states), including Bitcoin, Dogecoin andEthereum
Webullmay not be the poster child for trading apps, but its feature set feels a step above Robinhood’s. Like its well-known rival, Webull offers stocks, options, ETFs and cryptocurrencies with no out-of-pocket commission. And similarly, Webull works on a spread markup for its crypto trades, so your cost is built into the trade. Webull moved its crypto trading to a separate app called Webull Pay and offers trading in basic coins.
• Cost:Commission-free, but spread markup of 1 percent (100 basis points)
• Coins available to trade:8 different types, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Shiba Inu
When you think of cryptocurrency, you might not think ofCash Appat first. The financial app is known more for its cash management account or even its ability to trade stocks and ETFs. But it also offers the ability to trade crypto, albeit only one — Bitcoin. While you can send Bitcoin to other users for free, Cash App charges what it calls a “small fee” for trading the coin, which it will disclose before you place the trade. That’s in addition to a spread markup built into the trade itself. Unfortunately, it doesn’t disclose its exact fee structure.
• Cost:Spread markup plus a trading fee
• Coins available to trade:Only Bitcoin
Like Cash App, you may already havePayPalinstalled on your phone and, if so, you could be up and running with trading cryptocurrency in literally seconds from now. PayPal charges a fee for any trade and also prices in a spread markup on trades. The fee starts at 49 cents for trades under $5, then gradually rises to $2.49 for trades up to $200. It then switches to a percentage that declines to as low as 1.5 percent for trades over $1,000. Helpfully, PayPal lists its fee structure plainly for all to see. PayPal’s sister app Venmo offers the same services on similar terms.
• Cost:Spread markup of about 0.5 percent plus a trading fee that starts at 49 cents and declines to 1.5 percent
• Coins available to trade:Four different cryptos — Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash
The best crypto trading app or exchange for you depends on your needs. If you’re looking to trade a wide range of digital currencies, consider an app or exchange that allows you to do so. But if you prefer to stick mainly to the major ones such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and a handful of others, then many of the platforms mentioned here can get the job done. But cost is an important consideration as well, so keep that in mind before opening an account.

76616,2024-06-12 17:40:57,GameStop Analyst Lowers Price Target After 'Rambling Presentation By Roaring Kitty': Does Video Game Company Have 'Enough Runway To Appease Its Cult-Like Shareholders'?,"Shares of video game retailerGameStop Corporation(NYSE:GME) have traded higher in recent weeks on optimism from the return ofRoaring Kitty(akaKeith Gill) and several share offeringsraising cash for the company.
One analyst shared his take on the latest events and recent share offering.
What Happened:Over the past 30 days, GameStop completed two at-the-market offerings, selling batches of 45 million and 75 million shares.
The most recent sale of 75 million shares raised $2.137 billion, which translated to an average share price of $28.50.
WedbushanalystMichael Pachtercriticizes the sale price in a recent investor note.
""Given that GameStop's share price closed at $46 on June 6, we had assumed it would complete the sale at an average price of $40. Instead, the shares declined precipitously on June 7, reflecting news from Reddit following a rambling presentation by Roaring Kitty (Keith Gill),"" Pachter said.
The analyst has an Underperform rating and lowered the price target from $13.50 to $11.
Pachter said the new price target reflected the ""lower-than-expected proceeds from the share offering."" The analyst estimated GameStop had around $9.50 per share in net cash.
On Wednesday,Citron Researchalso announced it wasno longer short GameStop.
""It's not because we believe in a turnaround for the company fundamentals will ever happen, but with $4 billion in the bank, they have enough runway to appease their cult-like shareholders,"" Citron'sAndrew Lefttweeted.
Leftpreviously told Benzingahe was short GameStop shares again. Left was one of the key figures in the 2021 short squeeze of GameStop shares.

What's Next:The offerings from GameStop draw mixed comments from Pachter and Left as the video game retailer may have taken advantage of the rising share price from increased trading activity in recent weeks.
GameStop has said it will use the net proceeds from the offering for ""general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments.""
Investors appear excited about the potential of acquisitions and investments, with trust from many GameStop shareholders, including Roaring Kitty, beingplaced in the turnaround strategyfrom CEORyan Cohen.
The two at-the-market share offeringsraised $933.4 millionand $2.137 billion respectively, adding $3 billion to the balance sheet of GameStop.
GameStop ended the first quarter on May 4 with $1.083 billion. The company previously said its cash balance was $1.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.
The cash balance could provide optimism for several reasons. First, the possibility of investments and acquisitions. With a shift to digital games, GameStop could look to diversify itself away from physical games for future growth.
Another item to keep in mind is the GameStop announcement last year that CEO Cohen now has additional control over the company's cash holdings. Cohen can buy and sell stocks and make other investments.
""On December 5, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a new investment policy that permits the Company to invest in equity securities, among other investments,"" the company said previously.
GameStop's filing didn't mention cryptocurrency likeBitcoin(CRYPTO:BTC), but investors are excited for the potential for cryptocurrency investment.Investors would love to see Cohen invest a portion or all of the company's cash into Bitcoin and turn GameStop into a similar trading vehicle to MicroStrategy, whose former CEO and current Chairman Michael Saylor began buying up Bitcoin with the company's cash.
As mentioned by Left, the new cash balance could help provide a runway for shareholders.
GameStop reported adjusted net income of $6.7 million in fiscal 2023, which was an improvement from a loss of $13.1 million in 2022.
The company struggled in recent quarters with losses, but several quarters have witnessed positive earnings per share.
Here are the most recent quarters withdata from Benzinga Pro:
Q1 2024: -$0.12
Q4 2023:$0.22
Q3 2023: $0.00
Q2 2023:-$0.03
Q1 2023:-$0.14
With the new cash balance, GameStop now has more potential to survive from future losses. The cash balance gives the company the opportunity for acquisitions and investments, but more importantly, the ability to not borrow or potentially not have to raise more capital in coming years.
Investors are eagerly awaiting details of what GameStop will do with the cash in the coming months, but right now many, including Roaring Kitty, are betting Cohen will make the right moves.
GME Price Action:GameStop shares are down 1.87% to $29.92 on Wednesday versus a 52-week trading range of $9.95 to $64.83.

20975,2021-06-28 00:17:27,China Bets on the Blockchain: A Special Report,"By Alexander Zaitchik, Jeanhee Kim, Kelly Le and Angie Lau, Forkast.News. First in a series produced byForkast.Newswith support from the Judith Neilson Institute’s Asian Stories project.
There is no stage bigger than the Olympics, for the athletes and the host country. Modern China announced its arrival 13 years ago when 2,008 synchronized drummers performed at the Beijing Summer Olympics opening ceremonies. In February, China is expected to use the Beijing Winter Olympics to unveil a creation of intense international interest: the digital yuan, the first major central bank digital currency, or CBDC.
Consumers are unlikely to notice much difference shopping with e-CNY, as the currency is officially known. It will be worth the same as cash and will activate with a tap, swipe or QR code. But the questions this form of money raises are profound. As governments around the world move to phase out physical cash, what will become of financial privacy? How will state-sponsored digital money affect China’s economy, its trading relationships and – most weighty of all – the future of the global financial system now dominated by the United States and the dollar?

“The question is not whether China’s CBDC will upend the current rules of global trade and commerce,” said Pauline Loong, director of Hong Kong-based research consultancy Asia-analytica. “The only question is how far-reaching the ramifications will be across issues related to who controls access to capital and its movements.”
But for all of the digital yuan’s consequence, it is a toe peeking out from a giant red curtain. Behind is an ambitious and largely invisible infrastructure program to rewire the country and its economy with a distributed ledger technology known as blockchain. China has moved deliberately to secure first-mover advantage in what it believes is the future of the internet.
If the digital yuan is Beijing’s tender for the digital frontier, its blockchain initiative is its bid to build the railroads.
The story of how China came to settle the technological frontier begins with the 2008 financial crisis. Just one month after the Summer Olympics, an underregulated U.S. financial sector tripped the world into recession. It was a vulnerability that China decided it was no longer willing to accept. As the crisis was unfolding, then-President Hu Jintao called upon like-minded nations at the G20 summit to “steadily promote the diversification of the international monetary system.”

Receiving a muted response, China forged ahead in creating parallel institutions to those dominated by the U.S. In 2010, when Washington’s sanctions effectively locked Iran out of the international financial system, China’s focus on cross-border currency flows intensified.
By then, domestic concerns were spurring creative thinking around monetary policy. One was how to get 400 million “underbanked” Chinese out of poverty. E-commerce giant Alibaba introduced a mobile payment system in 2008, taking advantage of the country’s high rates of smartphone adoption: By 2015, 800 million Chinese would be using smartphones, according to the Pew Research Center. But such private payment systems left the Bank of China on the sidelines and did little for rising Communist Party leader Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption strategy, which required closer state monitoring of money.
Then, around 2012, regulators began to observe strange patterns in power grids across the country. From Xinjiang to Inner Mongolia, huge amounts of electricity were surging into warehouses packed with powerful computers and colossal servers. The processors were crunching numbers to produce — or “mine” — a new kind of money calledbi te biin Mandarin.  At their peak in the late-2010s, Chinese miners are thought to have produced 95% of the world’sbi te bi, orbitcoin.
This money had no connection to a bank or any centralized authority at all. It was entirely digital and uniquely secure. Every transaction was broadcast to every computer within a network for confirmation and recorded permanently in a long series of distributed ledger entries, or blocks.
Chinese officials grasped the implications of this unregulated activity immediately. In 2014, its Peoples’ Bank of China (PBOC) began studying the possibility of a government version of Bitcoin. With each passing year, the disappearance of paper yuan from the economy made the idea more plausible. By 2019, PwC reported, 96% of Chinese regularly shopped online.
“Before many governments even knew the basics of Bitcoin, Chinese authorities started to take leadership in the security of the network on the mining side,” said Ian Wittkopp, vice president at Beijing-based Sino Global Capital. “This led to the development of a strong blockchain and crypto ecosystem.”
By October 2020, the digital yuan was ready forpilot testingamong China’s masses. All told, 750,000 people chosen by lottery were given 150 million e-CNY (US$23 million) to spend at roughly 70,000 bricks-and-mortar businesses plus a slew of online retailers.
Six months later, new trials allowed open participation. This marked the first monitored release of the digital yuan into the wild. By June, nursing homes in Chengdu were teaching elderly residents how to use the new money.
Such care and expense are necessary to ensure the Olympics debut is as well-rehearsed as those 2,008 drummers, according to Peter Cai, who studies China’s economy and trade policy at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. “The cost of getting something wrong on this is tremendous,” he said. “Chinese officials are right to talk about the digital currency as if it’s a new frontier. What are the full implications for financial, banking and payment systems, or the conduct of a monetary policy? I don’t think anybody has a firm grip on that. And that includes China.”
During two decades of historic economic growth, China has had a mixed record on high technologies. It has struggled to attain self-sufficiency – never mind dominance – in the production of semiconductors and chips. It was ahead of the curve on 5G broadband but lags behind the West in fields of arguably greater strategic value, such as artificial intelligence.
When it comes to blockchain, China appears to have taken a lead in a technology of consequence. After President Xi in 2019 promised blockchain would “lead the next wave of the digital transformation of China,” thousands of companies reportedly initiated blockchain projects related to everything from retail banking to global shipping and supply chains. This profusion of activity continues apace. Said Wittkopp, “It’s a field of one. No other country is even close.”
These projects are transforming a digital ecosystem that was already among the world’s most sophisticated, according to a recent McKinsey study. China has 850 million internet users and more than a quarter of the world’s most successful startups. One of them is Hangzhou-based Ant Group. The financial services giant has over 50 blockchain-based decentralized apps, or dapps, in areas such as shipping, insurance claim processing and charitable donations. Internet search firm Baidu, the Google of China, has 20 dapps, including one that has handled 35 million pieces of electronic evidence for China’s “Internet Court.”
It’s not just tech companies staking territory on the blockchain frontier. A division of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has developed dapps for retail and corporate use. Insurance giant Ping An uses them to finance public-works projects. A dapp used by the China Construction Bank has helped local banks facilitate $134 billion in loans.
“Blockchain will make our tech and our society work better,” saidYifan He, blockchain evangelist and CEO of engineering firm Red Date Technology. “It can make all the IT systems in the world communicate like they are in one room.” He predicts in 10 years all transactions that require more than two parties will be blockchain-based.
The state of blockchain today is like the internet of 1993, He said. Back then, most companies could not afford the entry costs of the nascent internet (which began as a public infrastructure project overseen by the U.S. Defense Department).
In April 2020, China formalized its bet on blockchain by creating the Blockchain-based Service Network, or BSN, managed by Red Date. It is an infrastructure platform that allows private entities, especially small and medium-sized businesses, to overcome the two biggest barriers to entry – interoperability and prohibitive costs.
“We built everything for you already; you just connect to it and work on your smart contract,” said He, who claims the development cost of a simple dapp within the BSN could be as little as 1% of commercial blockchain.
By its first anniversary in April 2021 the BSN had attracted 20,000 users and more than 2,500 projects across 120 “nodes” throughout China plus Johannesburg, Northern California, Paris, São Paulo, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. S-Labs, a Beijing startup, has used it to develop applications that have helped over 5,000 SMEs find more than 500 million yuan in loans during the pandemic. S-Labs Chief Technology Officer Li Ming said the BSN is easy to use because it meets Chinese government standards and helps them find customers. “The biggest convenience of BSN is its brand effect.”
And if He has his way, today’s youth will be the first blockchain-native generation. This fluency is already being developed in high schools where the BSN is exploring how to teach students, including by holding programming contests with cash prizes. “Blockchain should be a basic skill,” said He. “The idea is to help more people become comfortable using the technology.”
In June, Red Date closed on US$30 million in Series A funding that was notable for its global reach. Major investors from Saudi Arabia, Switzerland and Thailand participated.
Part Two of this series will examine how China is deploying technology – in particular the digital yuan – to advance initiatives that intertwine economics and geopolitics, straddle concrete and virtual infrastructure, and span the hemispheres from Cambodia to the Caribbean.

The move was prompted by the growing interest in digital assets, and the fact that 401(k) plan sponsors and participants are looking for ways to gain digital assets exposure in retirement portfolios, according to a Fidelity press release.
The new offering, which bitcoin-bull firm MicroStrategy plans to add to its 401(k) plan later this year, will be available broadly to employers mid-year.
Dave Gray, head of workplace retirement offerings and platforms at Fidelity Investments, told GOBankingRates that, “Fidelity is thrilled to launch a first-of-its-kind workplace digital assets account that will enable individuals to have a portion of their retirement savings allocated to bitcoin through the core 401(k) plan lineup. This new offering represents the firm’s continued commitment to evolving and broadening its digital assets offerings amidst steadily growing demand for digital assets across investor segments.”
Fidelity will allow clients to allocate as much as 20% to bitcoin, with the addition of other digital assets in the future, according to a spokesperson.
The move is being lauded by industry experts, including Brock Pierce, Bitcoin Foundation chairman, who told GOBankingRates that Fidelity has been one of the most forward-thinking financial institutions in the space and has been investing into many different crypto companies across the ecosystem as well as exploring mining internally.
“It is no surprise that they are rolling this out, as it is no secret that they have been working on this behind the scenes for a number of years. It will be yet another way for users to get comfortable adopting bitcoin,” Pierce added.
POLL:Do You Think States Should Suspend Their Gas Taxes?
According to the Fidelity Digital Assets 2021 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Study, 30% of U.S. institutional investors surveyed would prefer to buy an investment product containing digital assets.
Meanwhile, Fidelity estimates that roughly 80 million U.S. individual investors currently own or have invested in digital currencies.
Michael Saylor, chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy, said in the release that, “MicroStrategy looks forward to working with Fidelity to become the first public company to offer their employees the option to invest in bitcoin as part of our 401(k) program.”
“Teaming with companies like Fidelity that are innovating in bitcoin for corporations is important to us, as is furthering the development of the bitcoin ecosystem for institutional investors,” he added.
Not everyone is on board with adding cryptos to retirement plans. Indeed, in March, the Labor Department said it was cautioning plan fiduciaries, “to exercise extreme care before they consider adding a cryptocurrency option to a 401(k) plan’s investment menu for plan participants,” as it has “serious concerns” about investments in cryptos and NFTs, as GOBankingRates previously reported.

“In recent months, some financial services firms have begun marketing investments in cryptocurrencies as potential investment options for participants in 401(k)s. At this early stage in the history of cryptocurrencies, however, the U.S. Department of Labor has serious concerns about plans’ decisions to expose participants to direct investments in cryptocurrencies or related products, such as NFTs, coins, and crypto assets,” the Department said in a blog post on its website in March.

Argo Blockchain (ARB), the only U.K.-listed cryptocurrency miner, slumped to a full-year loss in 2022 as the price of bitcoin (BTC) dropped and mining difficulty increased, driving up costs as revenue fell.
The London-based companyreported a net lossof 194.2 million British pounds (US$240 million), or 40.98 pence a share, compared with net income of 30.8 million pounds, or 7.4 pence, the year before, it said in a statement. The bitcoin price slumped more than 60% last year.
Miners across the board struggled in 2022 as revenue declined alongside the bitcoin price while energy costs soared and the difficulty of mining a bitcoin block, which is when they are rewarded,soared. While rivals such asCore ScientificandCompute Northfiled for bankruptcy protection, Argo avoided the same fate byagreeing to sell its Helios miningfacility in Dickens Country, Texas, to Galaxy Digital for $65 million. It also negotiated a new $35 million loan from investor Michael Novogratz’s crypto-focused financial-services firm, secured by its mining equipment.
Argo's mining margin widened to 45%-50% in the first quarter from 35% in the fourth quarter, while daily bitcoin production rose 5%. Argo said it will now focus on its operations in Quebec, Canada, where it operates two sites totaling 20 megawatts (MW) of power, according to itswebsite.
""Having navigated challenging market conditions in both the crypto sector and the global economy in the second half of 2022, Argo has emerged stronger and in a much more solid financial position,"" interim CEO Seif El-Bakly said in the statement. Peter Wallresignedas CEO almost three months ago.
The flagship Helios site didn't have a fixed-rate power agreement, which meant costs rose sharply amid the2022 energy crisis. Argo tried toraise fundsto avoid bankruptcy, then eventually decided to sell the site, which has the potential ofreaching 800 MWof power consumption.
The firm ended the year with 2.5 exahash/second of computing power, slightly less than the3.2 EH/s it foresawin August 2022.
Argo isone of a handful of companiesthat agreed to buy chipmaking giant Intel's (INTC) bitcoin mining application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) in February 2022. It isdesigned a mining rig using those chips along with hardware maker ePIC Blockchain. Intel last week said it isdiscontinuingthe product line while ePIC Blockchain is promoting the Intel-based machines on its website to other customers.
Argo said it expects to receive 2,870 units of the Intel-based chips early in the third quarter.
Shares of the company fell 5% as of mid-morning on the London Stock Exchange.

92129,2024-09-02 10:09:00,Prediction: Bitcoin Could See a Massive Jump by 2025 for These 3 Reasons,"It's no secretBitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC)has hit a bit of a summer lull. But as its price undergoes a period of volatility, it's easy to forget that Bitcoin is still up more than 30% from the beginning of the year and more than 125% since August 2023.
While the recent sentiment may have turned somewhat bearish, there are several compelling reasons to remain optimistic as we head toward the end of the year. In fact, there are three key factors that could propel Bitcoin to new heights by 2025.
One of the most significant developments in the crypto space this year has been the introduction ofspot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). During the first quarter of 2024, these 11 new ETFs played a pivotal role in driving Bitcoin's price up nearly 60%. At their peak, these ETFs were collectively purchasing more than 10 times Bitcoin's daily production rate, creating a surge in demand that sent prices soaring.
Since then, the initial frenzy has cooled, but there are signs that the momentum is picking up once again. Just last week, Bitcoin ETFs recorded their best week since July, with over $250 million in net inflows. Although this is a far cry from the peak seen in March when they were raking in over $1 billion in a single day, the pickup in activity suggests that the market could be on the brink of another wave of ETF-driven demand.
The significance of these ETFs cannot be understated. They offerinstitutional investorsa regulated, easily accessible way to gain exposure to Bitcoin, and as more institutions embrace this asset class, the potential for price appreciation grows. If this renewed momentum continues into the final quarter of the year, Bitcoin could experience another major boost, similar to the one earlier in 2024.
The second reason to be bullish on Bitcoin through the end of the year is the anticipated shift in Federal Reserve policy. After more than two years of aggressive interest rate hikes, the Federal Reserve has signaled that it will begin introducing rate cuts, with the first expected as early as September. While this may seem unrelated to Bitcoin, the reality is that lower interest rates tend to create a favorable environment for cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin is often viewed as a ""risk-on"" asset, meaning it performs well when investors are willing to take on more risk in search of higher returns. In a lower-rate environment, traditional assets that thrive on high yields, such as bonds, become less attractive. As a result, investors often reallocate their capital into riskier assets like tech stocks and cryptocurrencies, ultimately driving up their prices.
Moreover, lower interest rates typically lead to a weaker dollar. This is where Bitcoin's unique monetary policy shines. With its finite supply and decentralized nature, Bitcoin offers a hedge against the inflationary pressures that can erode the value of fiat currencies.
As the Fed is expected to implement at least a 25 basis point rate cut in September, followed by the likelihood of additional cuts later in the year, Bitcoin could benefit from the resulting shifts in investor sentiment and capital flows.
The third reason for optimism is rooted in Bitcoin's historical performance. Over its 15-year history, Bitcoin has shown a clear pattern of experiencing a summer lull, followed by a strong finish in the fourth quarter. This year could be following that same trajectory.
On average, Bitcoin has returned -4% in September, 26% in October, 36% in November, and 11% in December. If these historical averages hold true, Bitcoin could see a significant rally in the coming months, potentially pushing its price past the six-figure mark to around $107,000. While past performance is not a guarantee of future results, the consistency of this pattern over the years suggests that Bitcoin could be gearing up for another impressive year-end run.
Whether Bitcoin ends 2024 with a major move or not, it's essential to remember that investing in Bitcoin should be approached with a long-term perspective. The current economic landscape is fraught with challenges, including soaring government spending, record levels of debt, and the ongoing debasement of fiat currencies.
In this environment, Bitcoin stands out as a unique asset with its decentralized nature and finite supply, offering a level of security and potential for appreciation that is unmatched by traditional investments. Just as crypto investors now look back at the days when Bitcoin was valued at $10,000 as a distant memory, so too could they one day view a sub-$100,000 Bitcoin with regret that they didn't buy more at current prices.

73882,2024-01-10 14:00:00,Financial Advisors Must Confront the Likely Spot Bitcoin ETF Crush,"With the first spot bitcoin ETF seemingly just a breath away, the financial advisory space should be either up to speed or scrambling to catch up with an inevitable rush of client curiosity .
Whether you’re already on the cryptocurrency bandwagon, have sworn off it or are somewhere in between, ignoring the significance of a new asset class wrapped inside an exchange-traded fund that individual investors can purchase with or without a financial representative will be impossible.
That should be enough of a wake-up call, but if it’s not, there’s also the fact that bitcoin’s price is now hovering around $47,000, which is up170%over the past 12 months.
Naysayers and skeptics have a legitimate counterpoint to a rally that’s riding the homestretch of a spot bitcoin ETF decision, noting that bitcoin is still down more than 25% from its all-time high of nearly $70,000 two years ago. And at one point a year ago, the digital currency was trading 76% below its peak as investors reeled from multiple crypto industry scandals and regulatory uncertainty, particularly in the U.S.
That volatility could cause the financial planning industry to pause, from the largest brokerage firms to the smallest sole proprietor, if a spot bitcoin ETF launches. After so much hype andmedia attention, nobody in the business should be surprised at this point. But that doesn’t mean there won’t be some cautious due diligence layered on once the first ETF hits the street.
Several calls to the major brokerage firms, wherecompliance departmentstend to be most muscular, received mostly predictable “no comment” responses when asked about advisor and client access to a spot bitcoin ETF.
The one exception was Charles Schwab Corp., which confirmed that a spot bitcoin ETF would be available on all platforms as soon as it is launched.
For those client-facing advisors the initial launch could represent an opportunity similar to initial public offerings, when big gains occur quickly. Those who hesitate could miss that sudden burst.
But even if the initial performance acts like an IPO, this is something different, and financial advisors acting as fiduciaries will have to find their own path to justify buying or not.
One thing is for certain, ignoring a spot bitcoin ETF won’t be an option.

* China curbs come on heels of Musk tweets
* Price fall undermines bitcoin inflation hedge argument (Recasts first paragraph, adds new comment, updates prices)
By Tommy Wilkes, Sujata Rao and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK/LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - Bitcoin and ether tumbled on Wednesday to 3-1/2 month lows, on track to post their largest one-day loss since March last year, in the wake of China's move a day ago to ban financial and payment institutions from providing cryptocurrency services.
At one point during the meltdown, nearly $1 trillion was wiped off the cryptocurrency's market capitalization.
In late morning trading, the market cap was at $1.65 trillion, according to data tracker CoinGecko.com
Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, had already been under pressure from a series of tweets from Tesla boss Elon Musk, but the news from China sent it further down, It hit a 3-1/2-month low of $30,066.
The cryptocurrency has dropped 54% from a record high of $64,895 hit on April 14. It is also heading for its first monthly decline since November 2018.
""Bitcoin's sharp price drop should come as no shock to the market,"" said Gavin Smith, chief executive officer of crypto consortium Panxora.
""Any asset which has risen as much as bitcoin over the past year can be expected to have pullbacks as some investors withdraw profits, like we're currently seeing. While often a brilliant investment opportunity, traders must remember that Bitcoin is still an emerging asset class and will continue to experience large price swings,"" he added.
Bitcoin's decline whacked other crypto assets, with Ether , the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, dropping to $1,850, its weakest level since late Janury. It was last down 26% at $2,497. Since hitting a record high on May 12, ether has plummeted 57%.
Meme-based dogecoin also tumbled - losing nearly 26% to $0.35, according to Coingecko.
Shares in the crypto exchange Coinbase dropped 7.4% on Wednesday. Coinbase's share price has nearly halved from the peak hit on the day of its direct listing in April.
Tesla Inc. also fell, down 3.8% at $555.83.
Cryptocurrency price declines last week were sparked by Musk's reversal on Tesla accepting bitcoin as payment. His subsequent tweets caused further confusion over whether the carmaker had shed its holdings of the coin.
China's announcement on Tuesday banning financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions exacerbated selling. China also warned investors against speculative crypto trading.
""The crypto markets are currently processing a cascade of news that fuel the bear case for price development,"" said Ulrik Lykke, executive director at crypto hedge fund ARK36.
Some cryptowatchers, however, predicted more losses ahead, noting the fall below $40,000 represented a breach of a key technical barrier that could trigger more selling.
A ""widespread deleveraging"" was sweeping through cryptocurrency markets, said Saxo Bank's chief investment officer, Steen Jakobsen, calling the selloff deeper and more widespread than earlier episodes.
INFLATION HEDGE?
Investors may also be exiting bitcoin for gold, analysts at JPMorgan said, citing positioning data compiled on basis of open interest in CME bitcoin futures contracts.
This shows ""the steepest and more sustained liquidation"" in bitcoin futures since last October, they told clients, adding that it pointed to ""continued retrenchment by institutional investors"".
The crypto asset selloff at a time when inflation fears are rising hurts the idea of the asset class as an inflation hedge.
Instead, more traditional hedges have been gaining ground, with gold up almost 6% this month.
The recent selloff in bitcoin and other digital currencies has sent market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies to $1.7 trillion, down from the $2.5 trillion record hit earlier this month.

The U.S. Dollar Index made several attempts to settle above the 96 level but these attempts were not successful. The nearest support for the U.S. Dollar Index is located at the 50 EMA near 95.80. If the U.S. Dollar Index gets to the test of this level, USD/CAD may find itself under more pressure.

Meanwhile,WTI oilmanaged to get back above the $92 level and is trying to gain additional upside momentum. In case this attempt is successful, it will head towards the resistance near $93.30 which will be bullish for commodity-related currencies, including Canadian dollar.
USD to CAD tested the resistance at 1.2760 but failed to develop sufficient upside momentum and continues to trade in the 1.2730 – 1.2760 range. In case USD to CAD gets above 1.2760, it will head towards the resistance at 1.2780.
A successful test of the resistance at 1.2780 will push USD to CAD towards the next resistance at 1.2800. If USD to CAD moves above this level, it will head towards the resistance which is located at 1.2830.
On the support side, the nearest support level is located at 1.2730. In case USD to CAD gets below this level, it will head towards the 20 EMA at 1.2715. A move below the 20 EMA will open the way to the test of the support at the 50 EMA at 1.2695.

62018,2022-03-11 01:48:55,"Dollar hits five-year high vs yen, euro sags amid Ukraine uncertainty","By John McCrank and Joice Alves
New York (Reuters) -The dollar rose on Friday, notching a five-year high against the safe-haven yen, while commodity-linked currencies slumped after Russian President Vladimir Putin said there had been some progress in talks between Moscow and Ukraine.
Putin said in a meeting with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko that there had been ""certain positive shifts"" in negotiations with Ukraine and that talks continued practically on a daily basis.
Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation,"" has roiled markets, causing volatility in commodity prices and threatening global economic growth prospects.
The dollar initially declined on the news, but then gradually firmed and was last up 0.76% against a basket of six global peers at 99.11. The index was on track for a 0.56% increase for the week, following last week's 2% rise, which was its largest weekly percentage gain since April 2020.
The greenback hit a five-year high against the Japanese yen, which was down 1.03% at 117.32 yen.
""When people are taking a look at which economies are poised to handle the widespread inflationary pressures, the U.S. economy is looking like it's going to be the outperformer and that's why you're seeing the dollar do well against the yen in these risk-averse times,"" said Ed Moya, senior analyst at Oanda.
The dollar has also been supported by expectations that the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates at the end of its March 15-16 policy meeting, with inflation running hot.
While the U.S. central bank is all but certain to hike rates from the COVID-19 pandemic low, the Bank of Japan, which also holds a policy meeting next week, is set to remain an outlier.
The euro slid 0.69% against the dollar to $1.0912, erasing gains from the overnight session and putting it on track to end the week slightly lower for what would be its sixth-straight weekly loss. The single currency has fallen more than 2.5% against the U.S. dollar in March.
After hitting a nearly two-year low on Monday amid growing stagflation worries arising from the Ukraine war, the euro received some support from the European Central Bank's announcement that it will phase out its stimulus, opening the door to an interest rate hike before the end of 2022.
Commodity-linked currencies, including the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar, were lower versus the greenback, with the Aussie and the kiwi both down 0.8%.
""Currencies that had been gainers because of the commodity chaos ... are starting to come down a little bit based on this idea that if perhaps there is optimism and positivity towards talks and there is any chance that there is a cease-fire or peace, that of course would get global growth momentum going again,"" said Juan Perez, head of trading at Tempus Inc.
Bitcoin slid 1.64% to $38,798. It had surged this week after U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Wednesday requiring the government to assess the risks and benefits of creating a central bank digital dollar.

68914,2023-08-29 17:18:57,"A Crypto President? Top U.S. 2024 Contenders Aren’t Fans, and Rivals Are Way Behind","Crypto was on fire as a topic in theearly U.S. presidential campaigning, but the first Republican debate last week showed it may not be an issue that has legs with candidates trying to grasp mainstream attention.
As the top GOP candidates spun out their well-rehearsed positions – minus former President Donald Trump, who decided not to show up to the first debate’s Milwaukee stage – they avoided mentions of cryptocurrencies or digital-assets regulation, despite its rising status as a priority in Congress and among financial regulators in the U.S. and abroad.
But their silence on stage doesn’t mean they don’t have positions on crypto, as some of them have made abundantly clear. The field of Republican and Democratic hopefuls are all over the map on how the U.S. should handle crypto, from suspicion to enthusiastic embrace.
While we wait to see whether digital assets come up at the Republican primarydebate next monthon Fox Business, here’s how the major candidates from both parties shake out on the topic:
• Donald Trump(polling at an average of 52% in asurvey of Republican primary pollsbyfivethirtyeight.com): Still the dominant Republican candidate, despite a dizzying array of civil and criminal charges, former president Trump is an enigma when it comes to crypto issues. He hasn’t addressed crypto lately, but in his direct comments in the past, he established himself as a digital assets skeptic. Still, that didn’t stop him from launching his own collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that reportedly garnered him almost $5 million in licensing fees, and he’s said to personally hold$2.8 million in a cryptocurrency walletas of early August, according to documents reviewed by ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Looking at his governing record, Trump spent four years in the White House without advancing significant crypto policy, though one of his appointees as a banking regulator –Brian Brooks at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency– did seek to open the banking system to crypto, and his markets regulators allowed bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) futures trading.
• Ron DeSantis(15%): The Florida governor, still clinging to the role as Trump’s chief (if distant) rival, is an avowed crypto booster. He made political theater out of an effort in his state toblock any future central bank digital currency(CBDC), insteadchampioning a pathfor Americans to invest in bitcoin and other crypto assets. DeSantis has sustained criticism against the current administration for what he characterized as a war on cryptocurrency, which he argued includes the White House and Treasury Department’s open-mindedness to a future digital dollar.
• Vivek Ramaswamy(10%): The biotech entrepreneur put in a lively debate performance last week,potentially elevatingone of the strongest crypto voices in the Republican field. Ramaswamy haspresented himself as the pro-Bitcoin candidatewho actually understands the “decentralized alternative” to the U.S. dollar, as opposed to what he’s characterized as rival DeSantis’ political posturing on digital assets. While Ramaswamy was noted for seizing a lot of the spotlight in the first debate, the same could have been said of Sen. Cory Bookerfour years agoin the first Democratic debate, which ultimately didn’t translate into staying power.
• Mike Pence(4%): Trump’s former vice president has been known to address crypto issues personally. But when in office, his pick to be his chief economist, Mark Calabria, was a libertarian who had regularly touted bitcoin studies and news for years on social media. And while Pence may not be dialed in to digital assets, his nephew, John Pence, hasdone some crypto lobbying, including for global exchange Binance as it’s been tangling with U.S. regulators.
• Nikki Haley(4%): The former South Carolina governor also hasn’t had anything to say publicly about crypto. In her role as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, it probably didn’t come up a lot, but for an official who has been in the public eye as long as Haley to not have a record of comments on digital assets – much like former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie – signals an intent to stay out of it.
• Tim Scott(4%): The U.S. senator from South Carolina is perfectly positioned to shepherd regulation for the crypto sector as the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee and a member of theFinancial Innovation Caucus. But he hasn’t, suggesting it’s not a priority or a political tack he’s willing to lean into, despite his announcement that a digital assets oversight framework would beamong his top goalsfor this session of Congress. However, he diddip a toe into crypto-adjacent legislationlast year when he co-sponsored a failed bill to expand the category of investors who could buy unregistered securities, including digital assets. More recently, he criticized Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler for his agency’s failure to head off the collapse of FTX, saying, “the regulators, the SEC specifically, have noted that it is the responsibility of crypto firms to comply with existing regulations, but it is also the responsibility of regulators to enforce existing regulations and to conduct appropriate, effective supervision.”
• Chris Christie(3%): The ex-governor of New Jersey has so far kept his distance from the subject of cryptocurrencies.
• Asa Hutchinson(less than 1%): In a 2019 state-of-the-state speech, the former Arkansas governor said he was setting up an innovation council that would – among other things –boost “blockchain technology”in his state, which had also dabbled in using theledger innovations in the area of food safety. Still, Hutchinson hasn’t yet outlined his views on the asset class.
• Doug Burgum(less than 1%): Last year, the North Dakota governorhappily announcedhis state was hosting the construction of one of the world’s biggest data centers and that it would be mining cryptocurrency. His boasting of the move to “further cement our state’s growing reputation as a hub for data centers and cryptocurrency mining” sets him up as an industry supporter. He has also beenreported as sayingthe disastrous FTX implosion was about fraud and not “an indictment that there’s going to be a place for digital currencies in the future of the world.”
• Francis Suarez(less than 1%): The Miami mayor is arguably the biggest digital assets fan in the race, having put his crypto where his mouth was when enthusiastically volunteering to take his government salary in bitcoin. Hetold CoinDeskhe’d similarly be happy toaccept campaign donations in bitcoin. Among his crypto positions, he’s said he would ban a U.S. digital dollar, set clear rules and classifications for digital assets and has experimented with the token MiamiCoin (MIA) in his city.
And the Democrats, where the incumbent president is so far commanding the field:
• Joe Biden(65%): The president, who hasn’t yet seen an electoral threat emerge from his own party, now has a significant record on crypto, judging from his administration’s performance in the past three years. Certain of his regulators have hammered the industrywith enforcement actions– mostly at the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission – as they accuse digital assets businesses of failing to toe the line on existing financial regulations, which crypto insiders say are impossible to meet. While his administration hasn’t yet crafted wide-reaching crypto rules, the SEC and Treasury Department have proposed some regulations that would have major – and potentially highly limiting – effects on the sector, from the SEC’s proposals on custody and defining crypto platforms as exchanges to the Treasury’s new proposal on how to tax token gains. He said this year that he’s excited about closing “special interest tax loopholes” that benefit crypto traders, and the White House has pushed for a30% tax on crypto mining. The administration has also been studying whether to stand up a digital dollar that could shake up stablecoin issuers, though officials insist no decision has been made. Biden’s direct crypto involvement has generally been limited, though he issued anexecutive order on digital assetsin 2022 – before the market detonated that year and crypto giants began toppling – instructing his administration to start getting a handle on oversight that would thread a needle to establish consumer protections while allowing U.S. innovation.
• Robert F. Kennedy Jr.(13%): His famous name may not get him past the criticism for what mainstream Democrats may characterize as extreme positions onvaccines and government conspiracies, but he seems to love talking up crypto. “Bitcoin embodies two of my highest ideals -- transparency and trust,” he said when he appeared as akeynote speaker at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami. “It's important not only for bitcoin but for democracy to be decentralized.” He’sinvested in bitcoin personallyand vowed tofree such investments from capital gains taxesif elected. And he’s vehemently opposed to a U.S. central bank digital currency, which he’s argued could be abused by an oppressive government – thesame positionoccupied by Republican candidate DeSantis.",27906.51,-0.16,27955.17,0.02,27853.25,-0.35,27919.86,-0.11,27950.88
58691,2021-06-01 08:06:34,"Ethereum, dogecoin surge as cryptos continue volatile recovery","Cryptocurrencies were broadly higher on Tuesday morning as they continue a volatile recovery after a major sell-off the weekend before last.
Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was up 3.6%, trading at $36,878 (£25,915). It once again fell below $40,000, although last week it did manage to crawl past the mark. It remains far from its all-time high of $63,000.
Ethereum (ETH-USD) — the world's second most popular crypto — soared more than 10%, to trade at $2,655, while dogecoin (DOGE-USD) gained 8.6% to $0.33.
“It seems like everything is very much hanging in a holding pattern,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Ava Trade.
But he said “the upward momentum still looks like it lacks any major backing, and a threat for a further downward shift in the bitcoin price is still certainly on the table.”
“Basically, as long as the bitcoin price doesn’t cross above the 40K and break another resistance which is at 50K, it is unlikely we may see a beginning of another major bull rally” he added.
Kaia Parv, head of Investment Research at trading platform Fxprimus, told Yahoo Finance UK that ""bitcoin and correlated crypto assets may have found their bottom as there seems to be bullish price action this morning. Having said that, technical indicators are still deeply bearish for the upcoming trading sessions.""
Over the weekend crypto portfolio management app Blockfolio asked Tesla CEO Elon Musk to create a hot tub heated by dogecoin, to which the crypto supporter replied: ""great idea.""
Musk has been a dogecoin supporter for a while now, tweeting about it regularly. Almost every time this sends the price of the joke token higher and this time was no different.
Meanwhile, bitcoin has been dampened by many things recently, including a crackdown in China and Iran. Last week, Bank of Japan governor criticised digital currencies for speculation.
""Most of the trading is speculative and volatility is extraordinarily high,” Haruhiko Kuroda had said.
And the country's regulator has alsoissued a warningto crypto derivatives exchange Bybit for allowing residents of Japan access to the exchange without registering with the country's regulator.

Financial advisory organisation deVere Group said it will offer its clients a fixed-yield bond that tracks futures of bitcoin and ethereum on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange over a one-year maturity period.

WisdomTree, an exchange traded fund and exchange traded product (ETP) sponsor, announced its physically-backed bitcoin and ether ETPs have listed on Euronext (ENX.PA) exchanges in Paris and Amsterdam.
“Listing on Euronext opens up more access points for investors to conveniently allocate to, and trade, both WisdomTree Bitcoin (BTCW) and WisdomTree Ethereum... This milestone represents the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies, the evolving European regulatory landscape and the latest signal that digital assets are here to stay,"" said Jason Guthrie, head of digital assets, Europe, WisdomTree.
""A willingness from regulators and exchanges to list cryptocurrency ETPs is lending further credibility to this growing and popular asset class. This development will buoy institutional investors, trading via Euronext, that have been waiting for further signs of acceptance before making their first allocations to digital assets.”

(ANET): Among Billionaire Cliff Asness’ Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential","We recently published a list ofBillionaire Cliff Asness’ 10 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) stands against other billionaire Cliff Asness’ stock picks with huge upside potential.
Cliff Asness, the founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer ofAQR Capital Management, is a well-known figure in the world of finance. Starting with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness was able to boost the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund’s assets to more than $100 million in just a handful of months. Cliff Asness’ investment strategies, which focus on value and momentum, have delivered exceptional returns for AQR, setting him apart from his fellow hedge fund managers. As a testament, the fund has produced positive returns over the last three years, with its greatest year in 2022, when it returned 43.5%.
The first quarter of 2025 continued that momentum. As Wall Street grappled with increased volatility resulting from President Donald Trump’s unpredictable tariff policy, AQR Capital Management outperformed the market by 9%. The firm’s Apex strategy, a $3 billion multi-strategy fund that includes equities, macro, and arbitrage trades, rose 3.4% in March, adding to its strong quarterly performance. Meanwhile, AQR’s Delphi Long-Short Equity Strategy returned 9.7%, while its trend-following Helix strategy gained 3% during the same period.
Cliff Asness has repeatedly stated that he is not an admirer of Bitcoin. In a recent CNBC interview, the hedge fund manager voiced pessimism about Bitcoin, claiming that it had no realistic use case, although he did not rule out the possibility that the leading cryptocurrency has formed a bubble. Back in February, the billionaire stated that Bitcoin and the S&P 500, were basically “the same thing” with varying amounts of volatility. Asness has also questioned the notion that Bitcoin must be seen as a store of value simply because it has a limited supply.
The billionaire seemed even more critical of the idea of a cryptocurrency reserve, a stance that sharply contrasts with President Donald Trump’s. In a piece written for The Free Press, the money manager stated his thoughts about the President’s executive order:
“I’ve been managing money for 33 years now with some modest success. While there are some worthy competitors, it’s hard for me to remember a much worse idea than the U.S. launching a “strategic cryptocurrency reserve.” Nevertheless, on Thursday, President Donald Trump issued an executive order calling for just such a fund. David Sacks—Trump’s crypto czar—tweeted that the reserve would be “like a digital Fort Knox,” perhaps forgetting that the U.S. has been off the gold standard since 1933. In any case, his words do not diminish my scorn for this dangerous boondoggle, as I will explain below.
For this article, we examined AQR Capital Management’s Q4 2024 13F filings to list down billionaire Cliff Asness’ stock picks with the highest upside potential. We ranked the companies in ascending order of their upside potential. These equities are also popular among elite hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) is an American computer networking company headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The company specializes in developing and providing multilayer network switches that enable software-defined networking in large-scale data centers, cloud computing, high-performance computing, and high-frequency trading environments.
On April 15, Evercore ISI revised its price target for Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) from $130 to $100, while retaining an Outperform rating. The change comes amid a challenging year for Arista, with the company’s stock price outpacing the broader market’s decline. However, Evercore ISI remains bullish, indicating that Arista Networks is on pace to meet its $750 million back-end AI revenue target and achieve growth rates in the low-20 percent range for calendar year 2025.
Giverny Capital Asset Management stated the following regarding Arista Networks Inc (NYSE:ANET) in itsQ4 2024 investor letter:
“I trimmedArista Networks Inc(NYSE:ANET) as it grew beyond 10% weight in the portfolio thanks to its continued outperformance. Arista has been on a tear in January and if our clients are lucky I will leave Arista alone for a while! The market appears to see that Artificial Intelligence data centers are going to require robust investment in networking equipment, and Arista is the leader in that sector.”
Overall, ANETranks 3rdon our list of billionaire Cliff Asness’ stock picks with huge upside potential.

71770,2024-01-05 23:23:42,Bitcoin ETF Issuers Clear Major Hurdle on Path to SEC Approval,"(Bloomberg) -- Firms looking to launch spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds cleared a major hurdle this week on the path to gaining sign-off from US regulators in coming days. Most Read from Bloomberg Musk’s Drug Use Concerns Tesla, SpaceX Leaders, WSJ Says Boeing Max Grounding Goes Global as Carriers Follow FAA Order China Says It Caught Foreign Consultant Spying for UK’s MI6 Securities and Exchange Commission staff told several exchanges and issuers seeking to list the ETFs that they should submit a final version of a key document as soon as Friday, according to four people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. The staff had no additional feedback on the paperwork for several of the firms after the latest amendments, two of the people said. The documents are what are known as 19b-4 filings, which are proposals for rule changes on stock exchanges that will allow the ETFs to be traded. A flood of these updated documents were posted Friday evening, including for ETFs from BlackRock Inc., Grayscale Investments and others. Read more: Why Crypto Is Counting on Spot Bitcoin ETFs: QuickTake The SEC commissioners are expected to vote on the exchange-rule filings next week, according to another person familiar with the process. Often, ETF approvals can be delegated to SEC staff without a vote by commissioners. It’s unclear if SEC staff had no additional feedback for all of the firms’ 19b-4 filings. The issuers also need the SEC to sign-off on the final versions of their S-1 filings, which are the prospectus documents for the ETFs. The SEC gave issuers a deadline of Monday at 8 a.m. Washington time to file updated S-1s, one of the people said. SEC approval of the 19b-4 and S-1 forms may or may not happen at the same time, though typically the S-1s are approved after the 19b-4s. A representative for the SEC declined to comment. Should both approvals be obtained, the ETFs could start trading as soon as the next business day. Last week, multiple issuers, including BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity, submitted amended S-1 filings to name their authorized participants — broker-dealers responsible for handling the creation and redemption of baskets of shares for ETFs. While the step is typically taken for granted in traditional ETF creations, it drew attention in Bitcoin ETF applications because some industry watchers had expressed concerns that Bitcoin funds would have a harder time attracting broker-dealers.

88465,2022-11-04 09:52:02,Doug Mastriano’s Prophets In Pennsylvania,"(Photo: Illustration: Benjamin Currie/HuffPost; Photo: Getty) (Photo: Illustration: Benjamin Currie/HuffPost; Photo: Getty) PENNSYLVANIA — LifeGate Church is nestled in a wooded area of Elizabethtown, 6 miles from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant that partially melted down in 1979, almost rendering this pretty patch of central Pennsylvania along the Susquehanna River a radioactive wasteland. The church was formed in 2010, and now a half-acre of trees behind the building lay on their sides, cut down to make room for an expansion that will include a new youth center. On an overcast Sunday morning last month, about 80 congregants pulled into the parking lot underneath brilliant orange and yellow foliage and filed in through the church’s red front doors, sharing warm greetings and smiles. I also pulled into the parking lot, glancing in the rearview mirror to see a car pulling in behind me with a sticker on its front windshield declaring, “CRT MARXISM SUCKS.” I was welcomed by Pastor Don Lamb, a tall, gray-mustachioed man who had recently recovered from a heart attack. (He’d collapsed in a nearby diner and technically died, he told me. But people rushed to his aid and performed a “miracle,” resuscitating him.) Lamb had made it clear before I arrived at LifeGate that he was wary of journalists like me, but that the church would stand by its promise to welcome anybody for Sunday service. I took my place in the rows of adjoined chairs as a full band — keyboardist, guitar player, bass player, drummer — started to play worship songs. The congregants rose to their feet, some with palms facing upward and eyes closed, singing. Lamb then introduced a visitor to the day’s service, Calvin Greiner, a middle-aged white man from over in Lititz who claims to receive prophetic visions from God. Greiner walked to the front of the room carrying a long sword and grabbed hold of the microphone. “I was instructed years and years ago to make a sword and to put on it specific words,” Greiner said. He recited the sword’s inscription. “ Anointed and appointed. Worship. Warfare. Prayer. Intercession by the direction of the Lord Jesus Christ ,” he said. “The other side says, The sword of the Lord — my name’s not on here — it’s The sword of the Lord. The sword of the Spirit .” Story continues “This was in the office of Doug Mastriano — some of you might know him — for 225 days,” Greiner continued. Mastriano, of course, is a state senator and Republican nominee for governor of Pennsylvania. Greiner explained how God recently told him to retrieve the sword from Mastriano’s office in Harrisburg, take it to Philadelphia, where a pastor at a church blessed it, and then to the nation’s capital. “God said, ‘After Philly, this must go to D.C. This must go to my Capitol in D.C. from Harrisburg,’” Greiner recalled, his voice breaking. But before D.C., God told him to stop at LifeGate, where he’d meet a man named Jim Emery, a church member who had worked as security for Mastriano during his campaign. Greiner invited Emery and a couple of other men to join him at the front of the church, where they laid their hands upon the sword and began to pray as the guitarist strummed a soft melody. “Oh Lord and heavenly father, we thank you and pray to you that you gave us this sword to bind the powers of Satan and cast it out!” one of the men said. “As this sword moves to Washington, I pray by the powers of the Holy Spirit you will send your angels in and around that building, Lord. And you will touch the mighty Angel of God and find the power of Satan in Washington and run him out of town, Lord!” The guitarist continued playing as Greiner closed the prayers by exclaiming: “So let God arise! Let his enemies scatter! Let those who hate God flee right now!” Lamb took hold of the microphone again. “We welcome you all to LifeGate, the church in the country that’s trying to affect the country,” he said. “We truly believe that God has called the church to be more than a house of offerings, a house of sermons, a house of hymnals. This will be a house of activating people to be engaged in the world we will live in.” Lamb asked the congregation: “How many of you look forward to the return of Christ?” The crowd erupted into cheers and amens. “That’s coming,” Lamb assured them, “but you got work to do until then.” Doug Mastriano, GOP nominee for governor of Pennsylvania, holds a sword at an event hosted by QAnon conspiracy theorists in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in April 2022. (Photo: Right Wing Watch) Doug Mastriano, GOP nominee for governor of Pennsylvania, holds a sword at an event hosted by QAnon conspiracy theorists in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in April 2022. (Photo: Right Wing Watch) In April, Mastriano spoke at an event in Gettysburg hosted by believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory. He told the crowd that he would be the next governor of Pennsylvania because “my God will make it so.” The event’s organizer, Francine Fosdick, then gave him what she called “the Sword of David.” She explained that she was giving him the sword because of the “warfare” Mastriano would have to wage on the campaign trail. “You’ve been fighting for our country, and you’re fighting for our religious rights in Christ Jesus,” Fosdick told him. “Oh yeah,” Mastriano replied, holding up the blade. “Where’s Goliath?” Mastriano’s campaign did not answer any questions for this story, including whether this sword was the same one I saw at LifeGate. Mastriano has run an insular campaign for governor, often outright refusing to engage questions from a mainstream media eager to press him about his apocalyptic Christian worldview. He has preferred instead to remain in a conservative media bubble, almost solely granting interviews to far-right figures like Steve Bannon. To better understand Mastriano, I traveled to central Pennsylvania to see the Christian nationalist extremists in his orbit up close. His supporters, some of whom are self-anointed “prophets,” see Mastriano as ordained by God to be governor of the Keystone State at a crucial moment in American history. Along the way, I joined a traveling far-right roadshow and neo-Charismatic Christian revival called the Great ReAwakening, hosted by former Trump national security adviser Gen. Michael Flynn and Oklahoma businessman Clay Clark. It’s a festival of MAGA and QAnon conspiracy theories — about the 2020 election, vaccines, the COVID pandemic, 5G, critical race theory and a globalist cabal of Democratic Satan-worshiping pedophiles — so outlandish that it’d be easy to dismiss as fringe if it weren’t regularly attracting thousands of people. It’s also routinely endorsed by some of the most powerful Republican figures in the country, including Mastriano. If polls, not prophecies, are to be believed, Mastriano will be clobbered by his Democratic opponent, Josh Shapiro, in Tuesday’s election. But his likely defeat shouldn’t distract from what Mastriano represents: The ongoing radicalization of the Republican Party into a sect that sees its victory as inevitable and predestined from above, and which paints its opponents as the literal incarnations of the Devil in need of vanquishing. In this view, democracy is merely a roadblock in a divine quest for domination. Waiting For Mastriano Early on a Friday morning last month in Manheim, a small town in the fertile farmland of Lancaster County, a few thousand people — almost all white, most middle-aged — entered the sprawling Spooky Nook Sports complex, laying their coats down on white folding chairs as a band on stage broke into song. “Way maker, miracle worker, promise keeper, light in the darkness. My God that is who you are,” the band sang as the crowd joined in. They wore T-shirts emblazoned with slogans like “Jesus is my Savior, Trump is my President,” and “FAUCI LIED.” Pastor Dave Scarlett took the stage, flanked by half a dozen people holding shofars — rams-horn trumpets traditionally used by Jews in religious ceremonies. In recent years the far-right has appropriated the instrument for its battle cry, a way of commencing “spiritual warfare.” Shofars were seen frequently during the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. “Let’s go to war,” Scarlett told the crowd, the shofars sounding off seven times. So began the 17th stop of the Great ReAwakening tour. Attendees were told by speaker after speaker that they — the true, real Americans — are under attack on all fronts, and their salvation lies in seizing political and cultural institutions to pave the way for the Second Coming of Christ. Many speakers claim they have a direct line to God. Bo Polny describes himself as an “experienced cycles timing analyst” in “Gold, Silver and Cryptocurrency” who uses “prayer and prophetic dreams” to forecast the markets. “The U.S. Stock Market Crashed 38% in March 2020, as forecast,” his website claims. “NEXT comes the OCTOBER 2022 WORLD ECONOMIC COLLAPSE followed by the return of President Trump… how will Bitcoin, Gold, Silver and Cryptocurrencies react in the turmoil? Become a PRIVATE MEMBER TODAY and get all the DETAILS!” (A 14-day trial is “only” $99.) Polny spoke at the Great ReAwakening show on Oct. 21. After a hard-to-follow explanation about the Biblical significance of the number “24,” Polny told the crowd that something big was going to happen soon, on Nov. 24 — perhaps the crash of the American dollar. “The system is a fraud, people!” Polny said. “It’s a fraud. Haggai 2:8 states that ‘the silver and the gold are mine, saith the Lord.’ Not the U.S. dollar!” He then added: “The seven mountains that are built — the financial system, the church, education, the government, arts, entertainment, media —  all of it is coming down, and seven new mountains will be built!” The crowd — which knew this prophecy well — cheered. The “ Seven Mountains Mandate ” is at the core of the New Apostolic Reformation. This relatively new evangelical movement believes in miracles, the supernatural, and the existence of modern-day apostles and prophets. It’s a movement characterized by Christian dominionism, the belief that Christians must gain control of the “seven mountains” of societal influence to form a perfect world. Only then, the prophecy goes, can Christ return to Earth. This theocratic philosophy makes no room for equal governance in a pluralistic society like that of the United States. Yet the GOP candidate for governor of the country’s fifth largest state is a devotee. Though Mastriano has attempted to distance himself from New Apostolic Reformation, he has appeared repeatedly on the campaign trail with its apostles and prophets, allowing them to lay hands on him in prayer. Mastriano was scheduled to speak at this Great ReAwakening in Manheim — organizer Clay Clark said Mastriano’s campaign asked to include him on the speaker list — but he wouldn’t appear until the end of the second day of the conference, after 16-plus hours of songs, baptisms, healing ceremonies and the casting out of demons. And wild speeches like Polny’s. “We’re about to witness the Third Seal of Revelation,” Polny told the Great ReAwakening crowd. “The angel of death is coming to visit these people before the end of the year.” A graphic appeared on the screen behind him showing photos of Hilary Clinton, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R), MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, President Joe Biden, Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), billionaire George Soros, former First Lady Michelle Obama, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and others. This graphic was projected onto a screen at the far-right Great ReAwakening show in Manheim on Oct. 21, prophesying that the This graphic was projected onto a screen at the far-right Great ReAwakening show in Manheim on Oct. 21, prophesying that the ""angel of death"" will visit 24 political figures by the end of the year. (Photo: Courtesy Brian Kaylor) “These people are going down!” Polny exclaimed as the audience cheered and clapped. “These people who think they are pharaohs! Present-day pharaohs who you shall never see again!” “This is coming with the greatest wealth transfer in human history,” he continued, making sure to plug his business. “Gold and silver are going to explode in value…” Polny’s hit list, which included many of the MAGA movement’s stated political opponents, was taken from “Julie Green Prophecies,” according to the graphic on the projector. Green, a fixture of the Great ReAwakening tour, is a “prophet” whose prophecies are reliably pro-Trump . They are sometimes violent too, like her prophecy that God — any minute now — is going to strike down Democratic politicians “for their planned pandemic, shortages, inflation, mandates and for stealing an election.” She has also falsely alleged that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi “loves to drink the little children’s blood” and that the federal government is performing “human sacrifices.” She nevertheless enjoys a close relationship with Mastriano. The GOP nominee for governor once shared a video of Green prophesying that Pennsylvania is a “hornet’s nest of corruption” but that “I, the Lord, am cleansing your state.” Mastriano has been photographed with Green and once invited her to give a prayer at a campaign rally. At the Patriots Arise conference in Gettysburg — where Mastriano accepted his sword — Green delivered another prophecy. “Yes, Doug, I am here for you, and I have not forsaken you,” Green said, speaking as God. “The time has come for their great fall; for the great steal to be overturned. So, keep your faith in me.” Self-declared Self-declared ""prophet"" Julie Green, who enjoys a close relationship with Mastriano, speaks at the Great ReAwakening in Manheim. (Photo: Courtesy of Brian Kaylor) I knew all this about Green when she took the stage at the Great ReAwakening in Manheim. I did not expect to witness how much her followers adored her and how excited they were to watch her reveal prophecies on stage. “Says God, ‘you can’t stop my son, who is the rightful president, and his name is President Donald Trump…” she said, as the crowd broke into hysterical cheers. “He is on his way back, and how he takes his position back on center stage, you will never see that coming because you won’t see me coming. And I am with him.’” Green said that Trump’s return to the White House might happen before 2024. “God said he can take this country back in unconventional ways. He doesn’t need an election to do it,” she added. Later, I saw Green wafting around the conference like a celebrity. She, at times, placed her hands on people’s heads, casting out their demons, causing her followers to break down in tears and even collapse. She and other “prophets” performed these rituals frequently. They claimed to heal the sick. A woman in a wheelchair stood up and walked, saying this Great ReAwakening was the first time she’d done so in 13 years.

(Photo: Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Valeri Boland, who coordinates volunteers for Mastriano’s campaign in Dauphin County, told me I had a demon. I had been watching the failed U.S. Senate candidate Kathy Barnette speak on stage when Boland sat next to me. She had seen my tweets about the conference. She whispered in my ear that they were “trash” and “full of lies,” pointing her finger toward my chest. She said she would pray for me to have a “radical encounter with God” so that the “demons inside me” causing me to lie would leave. She went back to her seat. Twenty minutes later, she found me again and apologized, offering to pray with me, an invitation I declined. She was joined by Francine Fosdick, the QAnon believer from Gettysburg who had gifted Mastriano the sword. The pair both wore “Mastriano” pins on their shirts and launched into a series of conspiratorial rants that they asked me not to record — including about the COVID vaccine and the Georgia Guidestones — while trying to convince me to accept Jesus into my heart. I walked over to where various MAGA vendors were hawking their wares. There were prophetic paintings, one of Jesus hugging an American flag and another of a lion, surrounded by American flags, and the text: “What storm Mr. President? You’ll find out” — an apparent reference to the QAnon “storm” prophecy that Trump will mass-arrest his political enemies one day. Other vendors sold $100 metal crosses, handbags shaped like guns, and “Trump is still my president, but Christ is King” sweatshirts. There were various questionable health supplements for sale, vitamins and anointing oils, and a blanket that purportedly protects you from 5G’s radioactive waves. One woman, who had hurt her wrists working as an Amazon delivery driver, showed me the bottle of “micronic silver” she had just bought, which she claimed instantly stopped her pain. Mastriano’s campaign had a booth amidst all this snake oil where supporters could sign up to volunteer. A nervous campaign worker moved aside as I took photos of the booth, stacked with literature about Mastriano’s pledge to restore “voting integrity,” “end mask and vaccine mandates,” and “put parents in charge of education.” I asked the campaign worker if Mastriano would still speak at the conference, and she said probably not. He was too busy. Clark, the conference organizer, kept telling me that Mastriano was still on the schedule. Unclear if Mastriano is gonna show today or tomorrow at all - but his campaign has a booth here pic.twitter.com/1IRJQRI5cz — Christopher Mathias (@letsgomathias) October 21, 2022 “I identify as a man today — is it OK to be in here?” a man in the men’s bathroom loudly joked as he used a urinal, with three other grown men next to him guffawing. (Nearly every speaker at the conference had gone after transgender people, some calling gender dysphoria the work of the devil.) Outside, I found Pennsylvania state Rep. Dave Zimmerman, who I’d interviewed a few weeks prior at a small rally for Mastriano in Harrisburg. At that rally, he had admitted to being subpoenaed by the FBI, likely over his involvement with Mastriano’s scheme to install fake electors after the 2020 election to give the presidency to Trump. I showed Zimmerman a photo of the “angel of death” prophecy that had been projected on stage, making sure it was close enough so he could read the text above the faces of the 24 people prophesied to die in the next couple of months: “Angel of Death coming for them by year-end. ’TREASON will be written on them for ETERNITY.” Is this OK? I asked Zimmerman. He demurred. “I don’t know what was said. But there’s no question there’s, you know, there’s good things, and there’s bad things happening in our country, and some individuals promote good things, and some individuals promote bad things.” I asked him: “Do you believe in modern-day prophets who have a direct line to God?” ”You know, throughout the Old Testament, New Testament scripture, God used prophets, and I’m sure he’s using prophets today as well. There’s clearly prophets that can talk to God, I’m sure,” Zimmerman said. QAnon’s actual core is that you need mass murder to save America, and that part hasn’t died. Thomas LeCaque, associate professor of history at Grand View University Outside the building, I eavesdropped as about a dozen attendees smoked cigarettes while chatting about their favorite far-right media personalities. “I go to sleep listening to InfoWars.” “That BS with the Sandy Hook lawsuit fucked him over.” “We were listening to Ben Shapiro on local radio — he talks too fast, though.” “Tucker Carlson — he is so funny sometimes. He just cracks me up. And that laugh of his!” Lisa, from Elizabethtown, lit a second cigarette after agreeing to explain her “Save The Children” T-shirt to me. The Illuminati, she said, are harvesting adrenochrome from the blood of sex-trafficked kids in underground tunnels. She’d seen video evidence of these rituals via DuckDuckGo — a Pennsylvania-based search engine. She turned around so I could see the back of her shirt, replete with a map of “THE TUNNEL SYSTEM OF THE UNITED STATES.” A woman at the Great ReAwakening event shows off a shirt mapping out underground tunnels across the U.S. where she believes the Illuminati are harvesting children's blood. (Photo: Christopher Mathias / HuffPost) A woman at the Great ReAwakening event shows off a shirt mapping out underground tunnels across the U.S. where she believes the Illuminati are harvesting children's blood. (Photo: Christopher Mathias / HuffPost) This conspiracy theory is at the heart of QAnon , the authoritarian fantasy that one day Trump will destroy this cabal of pedophiles, who incidentally are his political foes. Support for QAnon was evident at the Great ReAwakening — with one speaker leading the crowd in reciting the movement’s slogan, “Where we go one, we go all.”  But it was far less pronounced than it might’ve been at a MAGA event two or three years ago. I called Thomas LeCaque, an associate professor of history at Grand View University who studies apocalyptic religion and political violence, to ask him whether this was because QAnon’s brand, with all of its wild prophecies and numerologies, and its association with the Jan. 6 insurrection, had simply become too toxic. “I think it’s much worse than that,” he said. “I think QAnon became so normalized in the far right that you don’t need the specific banners of Q to announce it’s already there.” When you peel away all the “genuinely batshit crazy prophetic aspects,” LeCaque explained, QAnon at its core is a “mass murder fantasy” about the coming “storm” when all of the MAGA movement’s enemies will be arrested and lynched. “The ideology that your enemies are literal monsters and that something needs to be done about them — that part has unfortunately become far too mainstream,” LeCaque said. “I think that’s the part that should worry us a lot more. Like it’s really easy to make fun of QAnon in its purest state, but QAnon’s actual core is that you need mass murder to save America, and that part hasn’t died.” Hand gun- and rifle-themed American flags, hats and other MAGA gear is sold during the ReAwaken America Tour.

(Photo: Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Inside the conference, there was excitement about the arrival of Trump’s adult son. “Does anybody in this room not think that we won Pennsylvania?” Eric Trump asked the crowd after taking the stage. “It was the biggest fraud.” He then gave a speech similar to the ones he’s given at other ReAwaken tour stops — the election was stolen, Christianity is under attack, liberals are indoctrinating your kids in schools — before taking out his phone and calling his dad. Eric Trump held the phone to the microphone so the crowd, growing ecstatic, could hear the former president say, “We love you. We’re going to bring this country back because I think our country has never been in such bad shape as it is now.” The crowd started to chant: “Trump! Trump! Trump!” Then Eric Trump thanked Clark, the conference’s organizer, who had joined him on stage. “I love you guys,” he told Clark, “the job you’ve done…” The crowd started to cheer loudly for Clark. I was close enough to the stage to see the tears welling up in Clark’s eyes. Clark is a far-right podcaster and business consultant from Tulsa, Oklahoma, who believes that a  2013 prophecy from a self-anointed Christian “prophet” named Kim Clement about “a man by the name of Mr. Clark and… another man by the name of Donald” was about him and Trump. He interpreted this prophecy as a call from God to launch the Great ReAwakening, holding the show’s first iteration in Tulsa last April. He has used the tour to push the unhinged conspiracy theory that the COVID vaccine is a trick by billionaire Bill Gates to alter our DNA, making the number of genes a variant of the devil’s number — 666, also known as the “Mark of the Beast.” “The shot, the injection, the bioweapon, what is being called the vaccine — everyone needs to look this up — it’s called SM-102,” Clark said . “A core ingredient of the shot, SM-102, also contains a technology called luciferase—Lucifer race.” Now, here he was being thanked by Eric Trump in front of thousands of people. “He doesn’t need to be doing this crap, and neither do I, frankly,” Eric Trump said of Clark. “But the guy doesn’t stop because he loves this nation, and he loves everything this country stands for. And you are incredible at everything you put together.” After Eric’s speech, many in the crowd started to filter out of the Spooky Nook complex, walking back to their cars as the sun set. A middle-aged white couple named Carl and Lori were driving a red, white and blue pickup truck covered in decals spelling out, “Doug Mastriano For Governor.” “He’s gonna do all he’s gonna say he’s gonna do,” Carl said of Mastriano. “No same-sex marriage, no killing babies, that’s the main thing, and taking care of the schools and not having teachers teaching what they’re teaching. All this transgender goings-ons and all that crap.” Carl loved all the speakers at Great ReAwakening. Lori particularly liked the prophet Julie Green. “She’s a very good, strong Christian woman,” Lori said. “God speaks to her.” Carl from Hershey, Pennsylvania, stands with his truck, which is covered in decals supporting Mastriano, in Manheim on Oct. 21.

(Photo: Christopher Mathias / HuffPost) On day two of the Great ReAwakening, I met Micki Witthoeft, the mother of Ashli Babbitt , the woman fatally shot by Capitol police as she tried to crawl through a shattered window into the Speaker’s Lobby during the insurrection. Witthoeft carried a small, 19-year-old dog named Fuggles in a backpack as she walked around the conference. She wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the letters “J4J6” — Justice For Jan. 6 — next to a photo of her daughter outside the Capitol building. “That’s my daughter an hour before she was murdered by the United States government,” Witthoeft said. This was her fourth time at a Great ReAwakening event. She was here with Randy Ireland, who led the New York chapter of the Proud Boys, a violent neo-fascist gang that played a major role in the insurrection. She and Ireland had joined forces to raise awareness about the mistreatment of Jan. 6 prisoners, who they said were being “robbed” of their due rights under the Constitution. Every month they host a candlelight vigil outside the prison in D.C. where a few dozen alleged insurrectionists are being detained. “We pray,” Witthoeft said. “We sing hymns. We have call-ins from the prisoners that we put out over livestream through a microphone and the telephone, and then at nine o’clock, we all sing the National Anthem.” I asked her how she felt about the Great ReAwakening. “I think there’s a lot of different people here with a lot of different messages, but one consistent message is we need God in this country. We need God in our lives. We need God to move us forward in our paths, individually and collectively. And so I believe, you know, it’s a feel-good moment for a lot of people that are here.” Micki Witthoeft, mother of Ashli Babbit, wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the letters “J4J6” — Justice For Jan. 6 — next to a photo of her daughter outside the Capitol building.

Over on the main stage, a murderer’s row of bigots, grifters, COVID-deniers, and QAnon influencers gave speeches. It became clear that Mastriano wasn’t going to show. He was speaking at a rally up in Scranton and likely wouldn’t have time to get here. Not that he was going to sway any voters here, anyway. He had their votes. His campaign workers packed up their booth and walked out of Spooky Nook. In his scheduled time slot, Donné Clement Petruska, the daughter of the late “prophet” Kim Clement, took to the stage and played videos of her dad “prophesying” Sept. 11, the rise of ISIS, and the election of Trump. The crowd oohed and aahed. The Sermon The next morning at LifeGate church in Elizabethtown, Pastor Pete Ogilvie used part of his sermon to talk about the Great ReAwakening conference. “It was like drinking water from a firehose, the release of all the information and things — I couldn’t take it all in,” he said. “It was a disturbing conference,” he said. “It was lovely and disturbing all at once.” I had come to LifeGate because of its close ties to Mastriano and its involvement with the GOP. Lancaster Online , the local newspaper, had reported that four LifeGate members, including one with direct ties to an armed militia, had been working as a security team for Mastriano on the campaign trail. One of them, Jim Emery, along with two other LifeGate members — Stephen and Danielle Lindemuth, who were at the Jan. 6 rally that turned into the insurrection — also won seats on the local school board. The church was making real inroads into local politics. I noticed Emery sitting in the back of the church during the sermon, holding the sword that had recently been in Mastriano’s Harrisburg office. Emery raised the sword aloft when he felt moved by the pastor’s words. “These are the things that we come against in the name of Jesus, that we wage war with, and these are the things that we will declare victory over today!” Ogilvie declared. On the wall behind him, a projector displayed a long list of the church’s enemies: “Mail-in Ballots, Dominion Machines, Election Day lasting longer than a week, Stolen elections, An illegitimate Administration in the WH….Human-Trafficking, Fentynol flooding our country, opioid addiction rampant, sexual immorality being the standard, Greed, Satanic Worship… Doctrines of demons, Critical Race Theory in our schools, Porn in our libraries, Boys competing in girl’s sports, pronoun protocols, Liberal media lies and canceling the conservative voices…” Ogilive clicked through to the next slide: “Medical Tyranny, Mask mandates, Vaccination Mandates, Covid Testing… Clause Schwab, George Soros, Fauci, Bill Gates, Hunter Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Tom Wolf, Richard Levine, Gerry Nadler, the Jan. 6 Committee, Liz Cheney, The rest of the swamp in Both Parties, and Both Houses of Congress and the Senate….” Then he began to pray. “Lord, we believe that all these enemies of Your Word will fall, all your enemies will cower,” Ogilive said. Someone in the back of the church blew through a shofar. “Lord, we thank you, we only have enemies because you have enemies,” he added. “All your enemies are under your feet, and therefore they’re under ours.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

48427,2021-01-02 15:20:59,"Bitcoin rallies above $30,000 for first time","By Alden Bentley (Reuters) - Digital currency Bitcoin extended its record-smashing rally on Saturday, beginning the year with a surge over $30,000 for the first time, with ever more traders and investors betting that it is on its way to becoming a mainstream payment method. The price of the world's most popular cryptocurrency traded as high as $33,099 on Saturday, with almost all other markets closed over the first weekend in 2021. It was last up about 12% at $32,883. Bitcoin advanced more than 300% in 2020, and with the latest leg higher has added more than 50% since crossing $20,000 just two weeks ago. The blockchain currency has only been around for a decade or so, and in 2020 it has seen demand grow from larger U.S. investors, attracted by its perceived inflation-hedging qualities and potential for quick gains, as well as expectations it would become a mainstream payments method. Investors said limited supply of bitcoin - produced by so-called ""mining"" computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles - has helped power upward moves over recent days. Some also saw it as a safe-haven play during the COVID-19 pandemic, akin to gold. ""It's very likely that the asset will eventually pass $100,000 per coin,"" Sergey Nazarov, cofounder of Chainlink, a global blockchain project, wrote in an email on Saturday. ""People have been steadily losing faith in their government currencies for years, and the monetary policies resulting from the economic impact of the coronavirus have only accelerated this decline."" It trades on numerous exchanges, the largest of which is Coinbase, which is itself preparing to go public to become the first major U.S. cryptocurrency exchange to list on Wall Street. Multiple competitor cryptocurrencies use similar blockchain, or electronic ledger, technology. Ethereum, the second biggest, gained 465% in 2020 and was up almost 7% on Saturday.

74842,2024-01-11 13:45:00,"Can Bitcoin Reach $100,000 in 2024?","With the crypto winter receding and the optimism that often accompanies the new year, it's worth exploring what 2024 might have in store forBitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC). Can it keep up the momentum from last year? Or is there a correction in the forecast?
Let's take a deeper dive and see what investors should expect in 2024 -- and why a $100,000 price tag might not be impossible.
Before getting into estimates, it's worth considering and recognizing the general overview of Bitcoin's current position. To start, Bitcoin has more than doubled in value since the brutal crypto winter in 2022.
Like any market, ecosystem, or natural phenomenon, periods of contraction are followed by growth, and crypto seems to be following this pattern. There can be some ambiguity when it comes to measuring the duration of crypto bear markets, but the overwhelming consensus is that this was one of the longest bear markets in crypto's history. With such a drastic correction, a significant resurgence was likely overdue.
But after rising more than 150% in 2023, Bitcoin would need to more than double in value again, increasing about 115% from today's prices to reach $100,000. Bitcoin is no stranger to making impressive gains in short amounts of time, but does it mean that it can hit the coveted six-figure mark?
To answer this question as simply and holistically as possible, you need to account for just two variables: supply and demand. This year Bitcoin is going to undergo its fourth halving. The halvings form the basis ofBitcoin's monetary policyand underpin its increasing scarcity by cuttng Bitcoin's supply growth rate in half roughly every four years (or 210,000 blocks added to Bitcoin's blockchain).
At one point Bitcoin's supply growth rate exceeded 10%, but it has been cut to about 1.75% today. But in April this year it will fall to just 0.85%. This halving process will continue until all 21 million coins are mined sometime in 2140; about 19.6 million circulate today.
Complex code enforces the halvings, but its concept is relatively simple. A reduction in the rate of supply growth creates additional pressure on prices even if demand stays constant. This is why Bitcoin increases an average of 128% during the year there is a halving. If a similar pattern unfolds this year, Bitcoin's price will exceed $100,000 when measured from its current price of about  $46,000 today.
Yet there is an additional factor to consider that may influence supply and demand and make this halving unlike any in Bitcoin's history. Currently, there are only 2.3 million Bitcoins available for purchase on exchanges. This is the lowest level seen since 2017. Most importantly though, this next halving will be the first time in Bitcoin's history that there are fewer coins on the market than at the time of the previous halving.
For all of Bitcoin's history, the total supply on exchanges grew, even as halvings passed. But that changed in 2020. The explanation for this is likely multifaceted but the most concise would be that demand has finally started to outpace supply. Now Bitcoin's historically low supply is going to come under even greater pressure with a halving on the horizon.
It's an exciting time for Bitcoin. The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday said it approved the firstspot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Developments of technological innovations like Layer-2 solutions, such asStacks, are progressing. And for the first time in almost three years the general prospect of a bull market is looming.
Accounting for these factors along with the next halving and an unprecedented supply shortage, the likelihood of Bitcoin fetching a $100,000 price tag is surely in the cards. In fact, it wouldn't be hard to imagine a scenario where Bitcoin flies past the six-figure mark in 2024.

There are currently65 names on this prestigious list.
While there is no question the 65 Dividend Aristocrats have staying power, that doesn’t necessarily mean they qualify for the best dividend stocks of all time.To my mind, it’s not just about increasing the annual dividend payment but also about delivering market-beating total returns.
So, for this article, I started with the 65 Dividend Aristocrats and whittled down the list to a manageable 10. To make the cut, the companies on this list must have a 10-year annualized total return greater than the entire U.S. market.

Lowe’s(NYSE:LOW) has increased its annual dividend for 48 consecutive years. Its 10-year annualizedtotal return is 21.18%through Oct. 6, 1,131 basis points higher than the entire U.S. market. It currently yields 2.1%.
It’s been a little over four years since Lowe’sappointed Marvin Ellisonas its CEO. Since he took the helm in July 2018, LOW stock is up 107% compared to 35% for the S&P 500.Ellison jumped over to the home improvement retailer fromJCPenney, where he was attempting to turn the department store around. Before that, he spent 12 years atHome Depot(NYSE:HD), where he was in charge of its U.S. stores.
In itsQ2 2022 press release, the company statedthat it repurchased $4 billion of its stock during the quarter, paying an average price of $185.19. It’s already made money on its buyback.

S&P Global(NYSE:SPGI) has increased its annual dividend for 49 consecutive years. Its 10-year annualizedtotal return is 19.75%throughOct. 6, 988 basis points higher than the entire U.S. market. It currently yields 1.1%.
S&P Global has been one of my favorite stocks to recommend in recent years.I included SPGI in a list ofstocks to buyfor the next 15 years in October 2021. It used to be called McGraw-Hill until the company sold off its McGraw-Hill Education subsidiary in November 2012 and subsequently changed its name to S&P Global.It’s been uphill ever since.
When most people think of S&P Global, they probably think of its ratings business, which saw revenue decrease26%year over year in the second quarter. Or they think of indices such as the S&P 500, which had a good quarter, with revenue up 22% year over year.
Thanks in part to its merger with IHS Markit, total Q2 revenue increased 42% to $3 billion. On a pro forma basis, revenue declined 5%. Adjusted net income fell 11% to $955 million.You can be sure before too long, S&P Global will do something about IHS Markit’s lower margins.

Automatic Data Processing(NYSE:ADP) has increased its annual dividend for 47 consecutive years. Its 10-year annualizedtotal return is 16.49%through Oct. 6, 662 basis points higher than the entire U.S. market. It currently yields 1.8%.
There are21 analystscurrently covering ADP stock. Most analysts have a “hold” rating on shares with an average target price of $246.71, just 8.6% higher than where the stock is currently trading.
Don’t be alarmed by this, though. Demand for the products and services the company offers — payroll management and human capital management — isn’t going away. That’s why ADP is expected to earn $8.02 a share in 2022 and $8.93 in 2023.
That means shares are trading at 25.4x2023 earnings.At first glance, this multiple probably seems high. However, it’s less than the stock’s five-year average of around 30x forward earnings.
ADP has one of the best 10-year total returns of the Dividend Aristocrats. That says something.

Sherwin-Williams(NYSE:SHW) has increased its annual dividend for 44 consecutive years. Its 10-year annualizedtotal return is 16.05%through Oct. 6, 618 basis points higher than the entire U.S. market. It currently yields 1.1%.
On Sept. 15, Sherwin-Williamsannouncedthat it was partnering with the Hollywood Sign Trust togive the Hollywood sign a makeoverto celebrate its 100th anniversary in 2023. It’s been over a decade since the company last touched up the 45-foot-high sign. Only a paint company as good as Sherwin-Williams would get this plum assignment.
SHW stock is down 41% year to date, in part because of lackluster profits. Second-quarter adjusted net income was$2.41 per share, 9.1% less than a year earlier. Higher material costs and supply chain issues cut into profits. Its gross margin in the quarter was 41.7%, 310 basis points less than a year earlier.
Sherwin-Williams stock hasn’t traded this low since August 2020. Its price-to-sales ratio is 2.8x. It hasn’t been this low since 2019. Despite headwinds, the company still expects to earn $8.65 in 2022 at the midpoint of its guidance.

Illinois Tool Works(NYSE:ITW) has increased its annual dividend for 58 consecutive years. Its 10-year annualizedtotal return is 13.94%through Oct. 6, 407 basis points higher than the entire U.S. market. It currently yields 2.7% afterupping its quarterly dividend payoutby 7% in August to $1.31 per share.
The industrial conglomerate’s goals are straightforward. It expectsorganicannual revenue growthof 3%-5%, 28% operating margins, 7%-10% annual EPS growth, and to convert 100% or more of its net income to free cash flow.
Illinois Tool Works’ diversification is second to none. It hasseven operating segments. All seven account for at least 10% of its 2021 revenue of$14.5 billion. For 2022, the company expects $15.7 billion in revenue at the midpoint of its guidance with a free cash flow conversion rate of85% to 95% of net income.

Hormel Foods(NYSE:HRL) has increased its annual dividend for 56 consecutive years. Its 10-year annualizedtotal return is 13.4%through Oct. 6, 353 basis points higher than the entire U.S. market. It currently yields 2.3%.
I don’t know if Spam’s resurgence is a sign of how expensive food has gotten or if it really is tastier than I imagined. Hormel recently said it is on pace tosell a record amount of Spamfor the eighth straight year. It turns out it’s trendy in Hawaiian, Asian and Pacific Island cuisine. Who knew?
Spam is part of the company’s grocery products division. For its fiscal third quarter, ended July 31, the division’s salesincreased 24.5%year over year to$869.8 million. Spam had something to do with the increase. However, the company’s refrigerated foods business continues to generate the most revenue, accounting for 55% of sales in the most recently reported quarter.
In the years ahead, Hormel plans to grow its business outside the United States. International sales currently account for less than 6% of overall revenue.
All in all, this is a stable performer in good times and bad.

On Oct. 6, Air Productsannouncedit wouldinvest $500 millionto build a green hydrogen production facility in Massena, N.Y. The facility can produce up to 35 metric tons per day. In addition, the site will handle liquid hydrogen distribution and dispensing operations.
This is part of the company’s commitment tospend $30 billionin capital over 10 years, ending in 2027. It also has a goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissionsby one-third by 2030.
Analysts expect the company’s earnings to increase 14% this year to $10.29 per share and 10.8% in 2023 to $11.40 per share.

Archer-Daniels-Midland(NYSE:ADM) has increased its annual dividend for 49 consecutive years. Its 10-year annualizedtotal return is 13.27%through Oct. 6, 340 basis points higher than the entire U.S. market. It currently yields 2%.
Archer-Daniels-Midland and agriculture go together like peanut butter and jelly. It’s hard to imagine the agriculture industry without the company. On Sept. 30, Archer-Daniels-Midland celebrated 120 years in business.
“Over the past 120 years, our company has evolved from a regional startup into an irreplaceable leader providing needed nutrition to billions around the globe. We’ve transformed at many moments along the way, but unlocking the power of nature to enrich lives has always been at the heart of everything we do,” ADM CEO Juan Lucianosaidina press release.
The best reason to invest in ADM is that it continues to improve its operations. By2025, it expects to grow earnings in thehigh single digits each year, with a minimum 10% return on invested capital and dividend payout ratio of 30% to 40%.
As long as Archer-Daniels-Midland continues to grow, ADM stock should outperform the index over the next 10 years.

Nucor is one of those rare S&P 500 stocks in positive territory in 2022. It’s up around 1% YTD, 25 percentage points higher than the index. That says a lot about the strength of its business.
If you’re reading this article, you’re a fan of dividend stocks. However, dividends are just part of the rewards companies give to their shareholders. Share repurchases are also important. The steelmakerrepurchased $2.7 billion of its stockduring the first three quarters of the year.
TheMotley Fool’sHoward Smith notes that, over the past 24 months,Nucor haslowered its share count by 15%.That means if you owned 1% of a company with 100 million shares outstanding before a 15% share count reduction, you now own 1.2% after the buybacks without spending a dime.
On Sept. 15, the companydeclared a quarterly cash dividendof $0.50 to be paid to shareholders on Nov. 10. It is the company’s198thconsecutive quarterly cash dividend. That sounds even more impressive than 49 years.
Also, in September, the company said 2022 would be themost profitable yearin its history.

When I think of Becton Dickinson, I think of the allergy shots I got every week as a kid. You couldn’t miss the BD logo on the side of the needle. While I’m glad I no longer get those shots, it’s a part of the company’s history — and a profitable one.However, the healthcare giant has changed immensely since then.
On Oct. 5, BDannounced a collaborationwith The Ottawa Hospital that will improve the quality of patient care by creating the first “smart hospital” in Ontario. I’m originally from Ontario, so I’m interested in this development.
In February, BDpublished a blog postthat discussed how connecting smart devices could enhance patient care through an integrated medication management system.According to the post, more than 7 million patients yearly in the U.S. are impacted by medication errors. It is estimated these errors cost hospitals and other healthcare facilities more than $40 billion annually.
The company’s software harnesses data to ensure safeguards are implemented to reduce these errors. The Ottawa Hospital gets to see this up close and personal.As they say, this isn’t your grandfather’s Becton Dickenson.

23835,2019-08-13 18:00:18,Is there a Bitcoin miner import scheme happening in Russia?,"The Federal Customs Service (FCS) in Russia is investigating allegations of unpaid customs fees for over 6,000 Bitcoin miners imported into the country. Cryptocurrency mining is the process of mining electronic currencies using modern equipment and special programs that allow you to gradually accumulate Bitcoins and other digital coins. The relevance of cryptocurrency mining is as high as ever in Russia since the country is still working on regulation for the sector. The Russian government has taken a strict stance on cryptocurrencies since the arrival of Bitcoin in 2009, and as such many laws surrounding mining are still murky. Now it seems that some groups are attempting to exploit this grey area by importing Bitcoin miners illegally and evading taxation. The FCS tightens control The Russian FCS has demanded that subordinate customs authorities tighten control over the movement of equipment for cryptocurrency mining. Due to the fact that the equipment for cryptocurrency mining operates on the basis of certain cryptographic algorithms, it is subject to restrictions that apply to the import of goods with encryption and cryptography functions. Mining equipment imported by individuals as goods for personal use, including shipment by international mail, must be declared to customs officials. Also, according to information from the Office of Trade Restrictions, Currency, and Export Controls, cryptocurrency mining equipment is subject to two technical regulations regarding the safety of low-voltage equipment and the electromagnetic compatibility of technical equipment. A conformity assessment of such equipment is carried out by customs officials to ensure it adheres to these regulations. The main manufacturer of Bitcoin miners and ASIC devices is the Chinese company Bitmain. The production of graphics cards for mining is carried out by the American companies Nvidia and AMD. As such, these miners need to comply with certain requirements for foreign devices and must be declared and checked. Story continues Russian police investigate Most ASIC miners arrive in Russia using illegal import schemes. More than 70% of miners enter the country through these schemes as a way of evading tax. The FCS has launched a criminal investigation into the case of an alleged exporter of Bitcoin mining equipment called the Far Eastern Commercial and Industrial Company. The company is accused of not paying customs duties on 6,000 Bitmain ASIC miners amounting to around $1.2 million. The Bitmain ASIC miners in question are touted as energy-saving Bitcoin miners with high hash rates. It is alleged that the company also falsified documents which showed fake pricing. The representative of Bitmain in Russia, Julia Fetisova, suspects that the root of the problem is large resellers who are buying huge batches of ASIC miners from Bitmain at discounted prices, evading any import taxes, and then reselling the miners in Russia with quick delivery and no import fees. Unfortunately, it is more profitable for illicit companies to work in this way rather than wait until their delivery passes through customs. As such, these schemes are becoming more common. Conclusion The cryptocurrency boom and the growing popularity of mining have led customs officials in Russia to decide that all mining equipment needs to be controlled. This is in line with the requirements of the Eurasian Economic Union regarding the import and export of goods with encryption and cryptography functions. However, Bitcoin miner import schemes are now present in Russia as unscrupulous companies and individuals aim to evade customs taxation. With the FCS now aware and clamping down on such schemes though, it remains to be seen whether customs officials can fully eradicate the issue. Read more about Bitcoin mining with Coin Rivet here .

84258,2022-09-12 17:44:09,K4 Global’s Joseph Ashford Brings Big Time Entertainment to Bournemouth,"ByJohn Jannarone
British entrepreneurJoseph Ashford’scareer has propelled him across industries in countries around the world. Now, he’s focused on giving back to his seaside hometown of Bournemouth on the English Channel – with a punch.
Mr. Ashford, who is Founder ofK4 Globaland itsTK4events business, spearheaded Bournemouth’s biggest-ever boxing event in late July. Thanks to his efforts along with promoterBoxxer, Comcast Corp.’s Sky Sports hosted and televised the “Battle on the Beach” between Chris Billam-Smith and Isaac Chamberlain in a in European and Commonwealth Cruiserweight title bout. Mr. Billam-Smith prevailed after a unanimous vote following 12 brutal rounds.
“It was an absolute war of a fight,” Mr. Ashford toldExec Edgein a recent interview. “One had some hand damage and the other broke an eye socket.” (Sky Sports hosted the event but it was also available worldwide, including on Fite.tv which hosts high profile pay-per-view events in the U.S. including “Iron” Mike Tyson, often compared with Evander Holyfield as one of the best heavyweight boxers of the 1980s).
“Boxing is big in London and up north and it’s been held in the same spots for years so it was difficult to get them to come to Bournemouth,” he said. “It’s one of my proudest achievements.”
The “Battle on the Beach” brought Mr. Ashford plenty of attention. “All kinds of influential people were calling me on my mobile to compliment me on the event,” he said.
Mr. Ashford, whose career began in construction, saw an opportunity in undervalued real estate and prospered as a dealmaker. “I began buying parcels of land without building permits,” he said. “I got the permits and was able to begin building.”
Mr. Ashford is far from finished with bringing the action to Bournemouth, located on the edge of Dorset county in southern England. Next up is Tyson Fury, two-time. worldheavyweightchampion, who has held the WBC title since 2020. Mr. Fury, like Mr. Tyson, draws an enormous international audience of boxing fans.
There’s more:Mr. Ashford has booked rapper The Game for December, when the Timbaland-era superstar will perform on Dorset’s shores. The Game, born in Compton, California, is known for restoring West Coast flavor to the American rap scene in the mid 2000s. His brother, rapperBig Fase 100, was aBloodsleader in Compton and The Game has spoken of a difficult upbringing in a poor neighborhood.
Mr. Ashford, himself, spoke of challenging times as a child. “I had a tough upbringing with lots of death in the family,” he said. “I battled starvation as a child and left school at an early age.”
“You can’t fix or correct anyone’s lives,” he said. “But it’s a fulfilling feeling when you can put a smile on thousands of peoples’ faces.”
Mr. Ashford is married with three children who reside in Bournemouth. “She’s an absolutely incredible woman,” he said of his wife.
Mr. Ashford’s portfolio spans media, real estate, classic cars, gyms, and more. “I’m an entrepreneur to the core,” he said. K4 Global is self-funded and doesn’t take external investors.
He continues to pursue opportunities in real estate – his mainstay. But he also sees opportunity in cryptocurrency. “Blockchain is so forward thinking that it needs to be the weight of the world,” he said.  “Bitcoin is so big and well established I can’t imagine it going away.”
He acknowledged the rising role of retail investors in public markets as a serious force. “Movements will be driven from forums and talks,” he said. “I think Covid changed the market itself.”

41625,2018-07-28 04:38:00,Gold Price Forecast – Gold markets extraordinarily volatile on Friday,"Gold marketswere very difficult to trade on Friday, initially breaking down rather drastically, but then turning right back around to reach towards the $1225 level. That’s an area that should have a certain amount of resistance attached to it, but I think at this point what we are looking at is a marketplace that is difficult to buy, even though we have seen such a nice turnaround. There is a lot of resistance above, and quite frankly looking for signs of exhaustion will probably be the best way to look for trading opportunities in this market.
Even if we break higher, I think that the $1232 level is another sign of resistance and should be where we see sellers get involved in this market. I think that the $1200 level underneath is massive support, and I feel that it is only a matter time before the buyers would come in for a longer-term move at that level. If we were to break down below the $1200 level, that could have this market unwinding rather drastically, perhaps reaching as low as $1000 given enough time. The volatility is going to continue to be a major issue, as the market is being kicked around by larger funds right now. That being said, I’m looking for a selling opportunity but I would be very cautious about when I put money to work.

88000,2025-02-09 10:00:00,"Is This 1 Massively Undervalued Cryptocurrency a Screaming Buy With $5,000?","When an asset is lagging behind for a while, it's often for a reason. But when a quality asset is underperforming for a long period, it could portend bigger problems -- or a sharp reversal to the upside when the market recognizes that it made a mistake.
In that vein, there are a few signs thatEthereum(CRYPTO: ETH)is undervalued right now, and for bargain-hungry cryptocurrency investors, there's a chance that a promising opportunity is lurking in plain sight. Let's evaluate the nature of the opportunity and determine if it's worth a moderate $5,000 investment.
Ethereum is in the midst of a rough patch that's gone on so long that it'sshaking outmany of the coin's longtime holders, and breaking the will of some of its stoutest evangelists. For reference, the coin's price is down by almost 13% during the last three years, a stark contrast with the surging prices of other major cryptos likeBitcoin,Solana, andXRP, among others.
Its dismal fortunes stem from a web of issues including challenges from competitors, changing management in the Ethereum Foundation nonprofit, and barriers to adoption by new users.
In terms of the competition, Solana appears to be eating its lunch thanks to its lowerfees, faster transaction times, and interest from investors seeking exposure to meme coins. Repeated upgrades to the Ethereum network haven't delivered costs as low as Solana's, nor have they delivered transaction times that are as quick. Furthermore, while the Ethereum Foundation's senior leadership is being switched up as of early this year, with an emphasis on more technically oriented talent, it will take some time for any newly appointed leaders to craft technical solutions to these issues, if there are any.
Barriers to adoption have also remained fairly significant for Ethereum in comparison to Solana specifically. One of Ethereum's emphases is on smart contracts, which are fairly technical in nature and not necessarily useful for the average developer, nor for the average investor. At the same time, the software products in the Ethereum ecosystem are, on average, a bit clunkier, slower, and overall harder to use than their Solana equivalents, including for very basic applications like for accessing and managing cryptocurrency wallets. So the user experience is not as good, which causes newcomers to gravitate to Solana's blockchain rather than Ethereum's.
For Ethereum to be a screaming buy with your $5,000, investors would need to be confident that there are drivers that would end its underperformance if the asset were to be held for the long term.
On that front, there are a couple of beacons of hope.
In particular, infrastructure projects catering to deploying artificial intelligence (AI) applications and interacting with AI agents will likely benefit more from being on Ethereum because its smart contract functionality has been in the hands of developers for a bit longer than the equivalent capabilities on Solana. If the AI segment proves to be a large one, and over the next few years it certainly might, it will represent a real opportunity for Ethereum to reclaim its status as an exciting place to develop applications and to invest. If so, its price will rise as a result.
Another beacon of hope is that eventually, the new staff at the Ethereum Foundation will be able to rekindle some enthusiasm for the project ecosystem on the chain. When paired with a few upgrades to the chain's technology to make it cheaper, faster, and easier to use, it's easy to see Ethereum's price recovering within the next three years.
Still, neither of these possibilities for a brighter tomorrow are certain. It's entirely possible that Ethereum has another few years of underperformance ahead of it, and practically guaranteed that in the near term it won't perform much better than it has in the face of Solana's rise.
Thus, while it is very likely to be a good purchase at this price level for very patient investors who are willing to hold on to their tokens for years and years, it is by no means a screaming buy at the moment, especially not for a substantial amount of money like $5,000. Check back in six months to see if things are changing for the better, and then reassess at that point.

A source from the world of institutional crypto trading confirmed to CoinDesk that Goldman acts as a feeder to the Galaxy fund.
The amended Form D filing states “Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC will receive an introduction fee” for clients it brings to the “Galaxy Institutional Ethereum Fund.” Galaxy issued that fund last March.
With a $250,000 minimum investment, the fund has sold over $50 million to 28 clients, filings show. It’s difficult to say how much, if any, flow Goldman is responsible for as the investment bank was not involved when it first launched.
It’s not the first Goldman Sachs tie-up with Galaxy Digital, the crypto investment firm helmed by Mike Novogratz. In June, Galaxy agreed to funnel liquidity toGoldman Sachs’ bitcoin (BTC) futures offering.
Galaxy offers a bitcoin fund to Morgan Stanley (MS) clients in an arrangement that is similar to this one with Goldman, a review of the filings shows.

93756,2024-03-21 05:10:50,Samson Mow: Bitcoin “Likely” To Touch $100K Before Halving,"Bitcoin (BTC)has witnessed a significant rally in 2024, starting the year at $42,208 and surging to a new all-time high of $73,737 on March 14. However, as the Bitcoin halving approaches in just one month, the price of BTC has experienced a retracement of over 16%, despite reaching a new all-time high earlier this month.
In aninterviewwith CoinTelegraph, Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3, a technology company focused on expanding Bitcoin access globally, has long predicted a strong upward price momentum for Bitcoin. Mow remains confident that Bitcoin will surpass its previous all-time high, stating that it is likely to reach $100,000 before the Bitcoin halving. He attributes this prediction to the voracious demand from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that consume approximately 7,000 coins per day, highlighting the scarcity of available coins.
When asked about the relationship between Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, Mow believes that Bitcoin will eventually decouple from other cryptocurrencies due to the massive inflows from ETFs. With daily inflows ranging between $500 million to $1 billion, Bitcoin benefits from a vast pool of capital that other cryptocurrencies lack. While smaller cryptocurrencies may track Bitcoin's performance for a certain period due to their lower liquidity, Mow believes they will eventually lose momentum and be left behind.
Mow also points out the common occurrence of founders and insiders propping up the prices of other cryptocurrencies before ultimately buying Bitcoin, leaving retail buyers holding the bag. The Bitcoin halving is expected to occur on April 20, in about a month from now. Historically, the price of Bitcoin has rallied significantly following the halving.",66348.0,-0.08,66301.1,-0.15,66396.19,-0.01,67100.0,1.05,66401.69

16983,2018-02-04 10:01:55,Relentless Negativity is Driving Bitcoin – For the Moment …,"This week, the bad news was aggravated byFacebook announcing the pulling of all crypto marketingas a “protective measure” to stop rogue companies involved in scamming via the platform. This has hit the genuine companies badly – and has further decimated the increasingly frail perception of Bitcoin as a viable financial instrument.
The result of this has been the biggest slide in price yet.
Our own worst-case scenario has been pushed lower by the volatility – and we now have to re-examine what could happen next.
Bitcoin falling to “new” lows is nothing new – to give this all some context – take a look at this snapshot of the daily chart, from August 2015 as a comparison to the current situation. At this point in its story – Bitcoin had reached $300 – and had fallen back to $200.
Here, at 1) you can see that Bitcoin fell below our usual 21-day, 55-day, and 100-day EMA support levels. It reached it’s low, of $200, on 25th August, at 2) before gently recovering until breaching the previous support levels (now resistance) at 3) to recover strongly again, at 4).
These EMAs were backed up by the ADX signals in the second panel, at 5). This shows the recovery of the 14-day ADX ( grey line) and the change in negative sentiment, under 2) where the negative 14-day DI (red line) is strongly above the positive 14-day DI (green line). This changes, at 5) when the positive 14-day DI moves strongly back above the negative 14-day DI.
The negative pulse signals, at 6) also become positive – with the price rise – and continue to rise, at 7).
Lastly, the red dot, divergence signal, at 8) indicates a strong change in trend – which is followed through, at 9).
What does this previous experience tell us about the current situation we find ourselves in? Simply, that markets go up and down. We have long spoken of the volatility involved in Bitcoin, and it’s sensitivity to the news – both good and bad. Cryptocurrency is very much an embryonic concept, which has only recently captured the public interest beyond the pioneers, and “crypto-geeks,” who invented it. Most people who invested in them since November have been driven by the percentage returns, rather than the technological knowledge that lies behind digital currencies like Bitcoin. These are longer-term considerations.
They are not the kind of arguments that people holding large losses want to grapple with. The uncertain – and worried newer investors – are running scared … driving the price lower.
Turning to the weekly chart, the heady days of a $20,000 Bitcoin seem very remote.
The fall has been as dramatic as the rise. Bitcoin has hit the 21-day EMA support level now – and is pushing lower, at 2). If it closes below the 21-day EMA, the next line of defense is the 55-day EMA, at 3). This would take Bitcoin to a new low of around $6,000. Of course, the 100-day EMA, at 4) the final strong support level, would see Bitcoin at around $4,000. This is low – but it is far from zero. Any of these levels may represent a new buying opportunity for those who are willing to see further than the immediate gains and losses caused by the flightiness of “investors.”
That Bitcoin has further to fall, is confirmed by the ADX indicator, at 5) with the dip in the 14-day ADX (grey line) being graphically clear, along with the rise of the negative 14-day DI (red line) at 6) which is just rising above the positive 14-day DI (green line) sharply.
The pulse indicator tells it’s own story, the strongly positive, light green pulses being replaced by strongly negative dark green ones, at 7).
Finally, the blue dot, at the top of the divergence indicator, at 8) signals a strong change in sentiment – from positive to negative – and this is borne out by the fall since at 9).
As usual, we need to keep a very close eye on all the signals and indicators, which will give us a timely warning as to what the next moves in Bitcoin might be. Be aware of the support and resistance levels we have pointed out – and be prepared to regroup around them if sentiment changes. We remain positive about Bitcoin into the future.
Right now – the bulls are at war with the bears here – what transpires depends when they decide to fight back … and how hard …

94660,2025-04-10 12:43:00,SPACE ID launches Payment ID on MetaMask and Binance to simplify CEX deposits,"SINGAPORE,April 10, 2025/PRNewswire/ --SPACE ID, a leading digital identity platform, has launched Payment ID - the missing link between centralized and web3 applications that makescryptotransfers to any address, chain, or wallet as easy as Revolut or Venmo.
Payment ID allows users to make seamless cross-chain transfers from theirdecentralizedwallets to centralized exchanges (CEXs) likeBinancewith one simple, human-readable, and error-proof handle.
A Payment ID can be as simple as a name - like ""jane"" - which can then be mapped to CEX deposit addresses across all EVM chains,Bitcoin, andSolana. To send assets to any CEX account, a user simply needs the respective ID, like ""jane@binance"" or ""jane@bybit"" - the rest will happen automatically. This eliminates the need to double-check the address and chain for each deposit and significantly reduces the risk of losses.
Harrison Seletsky, Director of Business Development at SPACE ID, says: ""Each year,cryptousers lose millions of dollars to phishing scams, copy-paste errors, and wrong chain deposits. This makescryptotransactions cumbersome and stressful, not only for users, but also for exchanges themselves, and it shouldn't be. Sendingcryptoshould be easier than traditional financial rails, not harder. With Payment ID, we have finally found a solution to this problem, and it's a simple one. One ID for every address, chain, and wallet. It's as easy as Revolut or Venmo, and that's what's needed to bring mainstream users into web3 and retain them for the long term.""
Already integrated into MetaMask via the SPACE ID Snap, Payment ID can be manually mapped to any CEX deposit address. An automatic integration withBinanceis coming soon that will allow the digital ID to be linked to allBinancedeposit addresses upon login, with other CEX and web3 wallet integrations in the pipeline.
To create a Payment ID, users simply need a Gmail or Yahoo Mail account, making the experience far easier than traditionalcryptopayment rails. SPACE ID utilizes a zkEmail solution, built ondecentralizedzero-knowledge (ZK) architecture, to improve the user experience. This generates a ZK proof to enable email log-in for on-chain interactions while protecting user privacy.
Christian Montoya, Network Expansion Product Lead at MetaMask,says: ""Web3 is all about making payments easier, but complex blockchain addresses get in the way of that. SPACE ID's novel Payment ID approach makes sending money as easy as sending an email. It's a perfect example of the kind of innovation possible with MetaMask Snaps – bringing privacy-preserving, interoperable, human-readable identities to the most popular self-custodial wallet.""

81090,2024-01-23 01:42:00,"UXUY releases 「Crypto Equity Manifesto II - Lightning Launchpad」, Calling for the Removal of Ponzi Models in new asset issuance","UXUY Lightning Launchpad is exploring a new model that is equity, transparent, and based on the native consensus of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, calling on the crypto industry to launch Launchpad in a more equal way within each ecosystem.
Singapore, Jan. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On January 22, 2024,UXUY, the next-gen decentralized multi-chain trading platform incubated by Binance Labs, announced that it will officially launch Lightning Launchpad based on the Bitcoin Lightning Network on February 1. And published theUXUY Crypto Equity Manifesto IIon the official blog, explaining the importance of crypto equity when issuing new assets based on Launchpad.UXUY Lightning Launchpad takes advantage of the lightning network's high efficiency and low gas and relies on the Lightning Network Invoice random number to ensure that the Launchpad process is transparent. It expresses concerns about the current Launchpad infrastructures' over-reliance on ecological token pledges and the token self-circulation model and calls for the establishment of a system that does not require dependence on ""a trustless"" architecture for any third party. The Manifesto also elaborates on the six basic commitments of UXUY Lightning Launchpad to ensure that the Launchpad process is equal and transparent, will focus on project innovation, calls on Builders to create products with real needs and promote the development of the emerging crypto community.
TL;DR
1. The current value capture of tokens has become overly dependent on staking rather than project innovation, and the self-circulation of tokens within the ecosystem is creating a new round of inequity.
2. UXUY embraces the best embodiment of Bitcoin and the spirit of Satoshi's vision and establishes a ""trustless"" architecture that does not need to rely on any third party.
3. UXUY Lightning Launchpad is exploring a new model that is equal, transparent, and based on the native consensus of the Bitcoin Lightning Network.
4. Only innovation can bring more valuable ""new assets"" to the encryption ecosystem, not Ponzi in a closed ecological loop.
Crypto infrastructure, Layer2, and GameFi projects are booming.As stated inThe UXUY Crypto Equity Manifesto, countless innovations are sprouting and the barriers between ecosystems are being broken down by the flow of cross-chain transactions. However, another invisible barrier has formed within blockchain ecology: Launchpad has gone to the opposite side of equity.The value capture of tokens has become overly dependent on pledges rather than project innovation. The self-circulation of tokens within the ecosystem is creating a new round of inequity. Frequent on-chain interactions have dragged users into the quagmire of sky-high gas fees. Currently, the encryption industry lacks equity and a transparent approach to Launchpad.With the UXUY Lightning Launchpad, we introduce a solution based on the Bitcoin Lightning Network. The Launchpad process is guaranteed to be equal and transparent through the Lightning Network native Invoice random numbers. The extremely low transaction friction cost of 0.000500 sat/sat (500ppm) reduces gas fee consumption. At the same time, the green and energy-saving characteristics of the Lightning Network and the non-ecological token pledge mechanism are used to meet the higher demand for Launchpad services from the community and industry.This is the best embodiment of UXUY’s embracing of Bitcoin and the spirit of Satoshi's vision of , establishing a “trustless” architecture that does not require reliance on any third party.As Mr. Satoshi Nakamoto said:
I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party. — Satoshi Nakamoto（October 31, 2008）
The crypto industry is gradually moving towards green, efficient, innovative, equal, and transparent infrastructure.UXUY Lightning Launchpad is exploring a new model that is equity, transparent, and based on the native consensus of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, calling on the crypto industry to launch Launchpad in a more equal way within each ecosystem. UXUY Lightning Launchpad will support more innovative, open, and transparent community projects to the greatest extent, and every participant should enjoy equal rights in the crypto world.Crypto equity should be based on cryptography technology and a “trustless” mechanism, which requires the encryption industry to jointly create and maintain. We should not expect powerful centralized institutions and projects that rely on closed ecosystems to promote crypto equity. Pledges between tokens can never reflect the essence of crypto equity. Only innovation can bring more valuable new assets to the crypto ecosystem, rather than the Ponzi under an ecological closed loop.
An equal and transparent encryption environment is the best soil for innovation.
Therefore, we make the following commitments:
1. The UXUY Lightning Launchpad is based on the Bitcoin Lightning Network and uses solutions with minimal energy loss to promote the transition of the crypto industry to low-carbon technology.
2. The UXUY Lightning Launchpad process is completely open and transparent. The user’s winning method uses the Lightning Network Invoice random number (based on the Lightning Network’s native consensus). The issuance process is traceable and verifiable.

35263,2022-05-28 17:00:00,"How to Make a Kamikaze, the Surprisingly Refined and Refreshing Vodka Cocktail That Gets a Bad Rap","Let me start by saying that I like Kamikazes. As a so-called mixologist and professional cocktail writer, I understand this is an unusual position. But I think its important to note that I dont like the Kamikaze ironically. I dont like it because its hilarious to like it. I like it because its good. To explain, lets look at three cocktails together: More from Robb Report How to Make a Watermelon Piña Colada, the Absolute Best Tropical Cocktail for Summer How to Make a Fog Cutter, a Boozy Tiki Cocktail That's Actually Delicious to Drink Moët Hennessy Just Opened a Swanky New Cocktail Bar in the Heart of Paris. Here's a Look Inside. The first is the Margaritatequila, orange liqueur and lime juicethe definitive tequila drink, one which can make a credible claim of being the most popular cocktail in the world, more or less beloved by more or less everybody. The second is the Sidecarcognac, orange liqueur and lemon juiceinvented in Paris in the 20s, bracing and racy, pure elegance, one of the handful of classic cocktails that enjoys near-unanimous respect in the drinks industry. And finally, the Kamikazevodka, orange liqueur and lime juicedisparaged, diminished, disdained and generally shat upon by almost everyone who would call themselves a cocktail bartender or enthusiast. Very similar drinks, very different reactions. So what gives? As best we can tell, the Kamikaze was invented in the mid 1970s, and has lived in scorn ever since. Maybe its because of the name, which would be bigoted if it were in any way coherent. Or maybe thats because it was an early harbinger of what would become a wave of shooters, saccharine concoctions famous less for their flavor than their provocative names (Buttery Nipple, Screaming Orgasm, Sex With an Alligator, blah blah, etc). Its hard to say. You wont find a peep about it in any of the serious mixology volumes written in the last decade, so to find out more, we have to meet the Kamikaze on its own turf. There, too, we find hatersHeywood Gould, in his 1984 novel Cocktail (which would become the Tom Cruise movie of same name), wrote: The Kamikaze is one of a class of disco cocktails invented by barbiturated teenagers. It is a senseless, infuriating concoction. . .Its intent is instant inebriation. . .There are no standards for the kamikaze. It has no particular attributes that would distinguish a good kamikaze from a bad one, like a dry martini or a tart gimlet. Ive made the drink with rum and applejack and never got a complaint. It exists merely to confer a little cachet on these pimpled baboons. Story continues It seems unsporting to pick a drinks fight with the 1980s, so Ill merely say I disagree. He seems to be making the category error of judging a thing by its fanbasewhich, as with Bitcoin or the Philadelphia Eagles, seems a little unfair. Dont get me wrong, Im not saying all drinks can be great. Theres very little that can be done for the Cement Mixer or the Brain Hemmorage, two irredeemably disgusting shots that taste even worse than they look. But the Kamikaze? The quote above compares it unfavorably to a Gimlet, but it essentially is a gimlet. It may have fallen in with the wrong crowd, but that doesnt mean its a bad kid. It just needs a little guidance. Put the smallest effort toward its developmentrecruit fresh lime juice and a high quality triple secand the Kamikaze can be a great drink: clean, bright and refreshing. Its a vodka gimlet made a little juicier with orange liqueur, lean and tart, avoiding the lingering presence of tropical fruit or the piquant sweetness of berries. Its clarity reads effortlessly as refinement. The fact that it was conceived without thought and for decades was produced and consumed without thought is immaterial. It really is quite good, and worthy of (unironic) attention. Kamikaze 2 oz. vodka 1 oz. lime juice 0.5 oz. triple sec 0.5 oz. simple syrup Add all ingredients to a cocktail shaker with ice, and shake hard for 10 to 12 seconds. Strain up into a cocktail glass, and garnish with a lime wedge or wheel. Notes on Ingredients Ketel One - Credit: Photo: Courtesy of Ketel One Photo: Courtesy of Ketel One Size: The above is for a whole cocktail, a balanced drink to sip across time. To make the Kamikaze shot, you could just make the above smaller, or you could treat it like a shot and make it a bit stronger: Do 1oz vodka, 0.5oz triple sec, and between 0.25 and 0.5oz lime, and cut shaking time to 5-6 seconds. It will be strong and tart. Vodka : The whole idea of Premium Vodka is a little like a get rich quick scheme, in that its not that it cant exist, but that that most everything that trades on that name is just a marketing ploy. As long as you buy vodka above a certain quality barsay, $10they will all probably be good. Note that Im not saying theyre all the same; Im just saying theyre all good, and mixed in drinks like the Kamikaze they will all taste so similar that its difficult to recommend one or the other. That being said, there are small differences there, so if youre attached to the particular echos of flavor you find in, say, Ketel One, then buy Ketel One. Normally, Id grab a bottle of a certain Russian label, but given the current moment, I recommend the equally goodbut SwedishSvedka. And if for some reason youre after the best vodka you can find, in our recent blind test, we found that the St. George A.P.V. (California) is the most interesting and dynamic, if such words can be used in this context. Lime Juice: In the 70s it wouldve been the incandescent Roses Lime Juice. Today, we use fresh. The above ratios will yield a drink thats a bit tart. If you prefer it a touch sweeter, drop the lime juice from 1 oz. to 0.75 oz. Triple Sec: I always recommend Cointreau, because its the best. Combier is also excellent. That being said, itll be the most expensive part of this cocktail by a factor of three, so if youre trying to stay in the spirit of the Kamikaze, you can go with a cheaper choiceDrillaud makes a cheap one thats pretty good, as does Bols, but try to get the Bols thats 60 or 42 proof. Same if you go Hiram Walker. Generally speaking, in triple sec, quality decreases with proof. You want it to be as close to 80 proof as you can afford. Simple Syrup: Yes, Ive added an ingredient, because using Triple Sec as the sole sweetener yields a drink thats either too sweet, too tart or too strong. Its easy to make simple syrup, which is why they call it simple syrup: Equal parts sugar and warm or hot water, and stir until the sugar dissolves. Put it in the fridge and itll last a month.

Per the announcement Coinbase Pro will now accept deposits of XRP for a minimum of 12 hours before enabling full trading. Coinbase notes that it will first establish sufficient liquidity on the platform, opening trading pairs in U.S. dollars, euro and Bitcoin (BTC) in phases.
Full trading of XRP will be available to customers in the U.S.,Canada, theEuropean Union, theUnited Kingdom,SingaporeandAustralia. Coinbase may expand its services to other countries at a later time.
XRP trading will go through four stages, which include “transfer-only,” “post-only,” “limit-only,” and “full trading. The first two stages will enable users to transfer XRP to Coinbase Pro accounts and post limit orders, the subsequent two will allow customers to match limit orders and fully trade with XRP.
Over the past several months, Coinbase Pro has been actively expanding its catalogue of tokens supported on the platform. In August 2018, itaddedsupport for Ethereum Classic (ETC),followedthe the Basic Attention Token (BAT) and privacy oriented altcoinZcash(ZEC) in November. Support for the aforementioned tokens was later expanded to Coinbase’s retail platform Coinbase.com and its mobile app.
The addition of XRP to Coinbase has been long-awaited by the crypto community. In January 2018, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrongquashedrumors that the exchange was added support for XRP in the short term. Following Armstrong’s announcement, the market value of XRP crashed from from over $148 billion to $126 billion.
At press time, the token is trading at $0.338, up over 11 percent on the day and 5.4 percent on the week according to data fromCoinMarketCap.

61115,2021-09-17 15:00:00,Next-Generation Layer-One Blockchain Protocols Remove the Financial Barriers to DeFi and NFTs,"Blockchain technology has emerged as a revolutionary force for change on the global stage over the past decade as Bitcoin has risen from being shadowy internet money used by criminals to an accepted form of legal tender by governments in countries such as El Salvador.
While the applications of distributed ledger technology (DLT) are vast and widespread, its potential to help reconfigure the global financial industry offers perhaps the most transformative opportunity in a world where more than 1.7 billion adults are classified as unbanked.
The creation of secure layer-one blockchain protocols capable of hosting smart contracts such as Ethereum has allowed for the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the explosion in popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), but their rising popularity has been a double-edged sword as increased use of the top networks has led to skyrocketing transaction costs and slow processing times.
Many proponents of some of the first and second-generation protocols including Bitcoin and Ethereum often frequent reassurances that developers have made significant progress in addressing these recurrent issues, but the fact that the same problems continue to arise during each bull market suggests that newer generation blockchain protocols offer the best solution to these longstanding difficulties.
Some of the new blockchains like Fantom have been gaining a wider adoption in recent months as suitable alternatives to Ethereum because of their inclusivity and easy onboarding experience. Thanks to the layer-one solutions, users who are not familiar with the new technologies and users who can’t afford hundreds of dollars for every single transaction can now start using blockchain and DeFi.
Related:5 Reasons to Get Started With DeFi
The rapidly expanding world of DeFi is singlehandedly reshaping the global financial infrastructure as all manner of stocks, securities and transferable assets are slowly but surely being tokenized and stored in digital wallets.
New protocols are arising daily that allow anyone with an internet connection or smartphone to access ecosystems that are equivalent to digital savings accounts but offer much more attractive yields than those found in the traditional banking sector.
Unfortunately, with most of the top DeFi protocols currently operating on the Ethereum blockchain, the high cost of conducting transactions on the network has priced out ordinary individuals living in countries where even a $5 transaction fee is a significant amount of money capable of feeding a family for a week.
This is where competing new blockchain platforms have the biggest opportunity for growth and adoption thanks to cross-chain bridges, a growing number of opportunities to earn a yield on new DeFi protocols and significantly smaller transaction cost.
Both Fantom and Avalanche have fully functioning cross-chain bridges that allow ERC-20 to be migrated to a corresponding token standard on their networks while Solana has created its ""Wormhole"" communication bridge that connects with other top DeFi networks including Ethereum, Terra and the Binance Smart Chain.
Anyone who hasn’t been living under a rock over the past two months knows that the NFT sector has skyrocketed in popularity along with prices as all manner of celebrities, sports stars and globally recognized brands have started offering one-of-a-kind digital collectibles.
Just as it was during the bull market of 2017-2018, digital collectibles from CryptoKitties to CryptoPunks have led to break records in terms of both prices paid as well as network congestion and fees generated.
Play-to-earn games have also become in-demand applications as NFT technology enables players to sell in-game items for real-world cash, but high transaction costs have once again priced out those who could benefit most from the access that these protocols provide.
This is yet another use case that has begun to see an explosion of interest spill over to Fantom, whose near-feeless transaction capabilities have enabled users from even the most economically disadvantaged areas of the world unrestricted access to protocols that can allow them to earn a daily living income.
Instead of having to pay more than $100 in Ethereum gas fees just to try and get in on the NFT action, users can instead put their money to use building their NFT portfolios and participating in the growing digital-collectibles metaverse.

On top of their low-cost nature, the newer generation protocols and pure proof-of-stake networks also offer an easy-to-use user interface that even the most non-tech-savvy individuals can navigate.
While many networks out there require an advanced level of technical experience to operate wallets and conduct transactions, Fantom has removed the advanced training required to operate the first blockchain interfaces and has created a UI that any modern internet user can operate.
Algorand has amassed a vast network of developers and scientists that have helped create a user interface simple enough that even well-known crypto projects like the digital-wallet creator Exodus have chosen the network to host its recently launched EXIT digitized token representations of its common stock.
For those who were around during the early days of the internet, few could probably have imagined the journey that has taken place from using programs like Netscape to explore some of the earliest message boards or chat with their friends to the current expansive digital universe that is social media and Google searches.
Just as many of those early programs that once dominated the digital landscape have now disappeared completely, so too will many of the popular first and second-generation blockchain protocols suffer a similar fate as newer networks with superior scaling capabilities and smart-contract functionality arise and gain the favor of the market.
These emerging projects, which offer lower-cost transactions at higher rates of scalability, are well-positioned to step forward and take a leadership role in helping to onboard the wider public and pave the way to a blockchain future.
The dawn of the blockchain era is now underway, and projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum have helped bust open the door and establish blockchain technology as a force for change on the planet.
Now, as more and more of the global population starts to make its way into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, it’s time for the next generation of blockchain platforms to arise and assume roles as leaders in this digital revolution as decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens begin to transform the global financial systems.

5918,2019-06-11 10:02:00,"Philippines’ Central Bank Will Continue to Closely Monitor Crypto, Citing Terror Financing","The governor of thePhilippines’central bank, Benjamin Diokno, has warned against the potential use of cryptocurrencies for terrorism financing and underscored that the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) will continue to closely monitor their use in the country. The news wasreportedby local English language newspaper The Philippine Star on June 10.
In addition to Diokno’s remarks, BSP Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo reportedly provided further insights into the institution’s stance toward cryptocurrencies during the launch of an unnamed book aboutbitcoin(BTC).
Diokno ostensibly criticized bitcoin’s potential to function as a unit of account, medium of exchange and store of value, claiming that the top cryptocurrency’s volatility inhibits its usefulness on all three points.
The governor reportedly recognized that blockchain and certain implementations of distributed ledger technologies can be useful for payments and settlements for peer-to-peer transactions, presenting this as a potential risk to the traditional banking sector:
“Game theory dictates possible dysfunction when there is market breakdown, when everyone may distrust one another. There cannot be a total disregard for a central bank or a third party that provides lender of last resort facility.”
Guinigundo said the central bank would approach fintech development using regulatory sandboxes in order to balance the prospective benefits of innovative financial technologies with robust consumer and investor protection.
The Philippine Star cites fresh data from BSP’s Technology Risk and Innovation Supervision Department, which has reportedly revealed that the value of cryptocurrency transactions almost doubled in 2018 — hitting $390.37 million as compared with $189.18 million in 2017.
The data breakdown indicated that conversion from fiat currencies into cryptocurrencies accounted for $208.27 million, crypto-fiat conversion for  $173.33 million, and crypto-enabled international incoming remittances for $8.77 million.
In February of this year, the Philippinesintroduceda new set of rules governing the issuance and acquisition ofutility and security tokens.
BSP hasrequireddomesticcrypto exchangesto register as remittance and transfer companies and implement specific safeguards — coveringAML, CFT, risk management and consumer protection — since February 2017.

83307,2025-01-13 16:21:41,Crypto’s Compliance Conundrum,"As Bitcoin continues to rise and institutional investors pour over $20 billion into crypto ETFs, a fundamental shift is occurring in digital asset markets. The appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair, known for favoring market-driven solutions over heavy-handed enforcement, has fueled optimism that crypto can finally balance innovation with regulation.
But the crypto industry faces a stark choice that no amount of regulatory flexibility can overcome: either sacrifice the unlimited programmability that makes these systems revolutionary, or accept that their compliance from an anti-money laundering regulation perspective cannot be fully automated or built into the system. This isn't a temporary technological limitation about one system or another – it's as fundamental as the laws of mathematics.
To begin to see why, we can think about an economy where shells are money. If we pass a law that nobody can transact more than 10 times per day or hold more than 10% of the shells, we have an enforcement problem. How do we know who holds which shells when? Information asymmetry stymies compliance and compliance devolves to a surveillance challenge.
Blockchain technology solves that problem. If everyone sees where all the shells are all the time, then enforcement works. We can build compliance into a system and deny banned transactions. Here, the transparency from the blockchain enables automated compliance.
But the long-held premise of Web3 is to automate stock exchanges and myriad complex interactions. Doing so requires moving beyond shells to a system where users create their own assets and upload their own programs. And permissionless access to publish these complex programs causes trouble for users who may be exposed to malicious programs or scams, the system which may face congestion, and regulators who care about preventing financial crimes.
The core challenge lies in what computer scientists call ""undecidability."" In traditional finance, when regulators impose rules like ""no transactions with sanctioned entities"" or ""maintain capital adequacy ratios,"" banks can implement these requirements through their existing control systems. But, in a truly decentralized system where anyone can deploy sophisticated smart contracts, it becomes mathematically impossible to verify in advance whether a new piece of code might violate these rules.
JPMorgan's recent rebranding of Onyx toKinexysillustrates this reality. The platform now processes over $2 billion in daily transactions, and participation is by participants who meet regulatory criteria before joining. Unlike typical cryptocurrency platforms where anyone can write and deploy automated trading programs (known as smart contracts), JPMorgan's system maintains compliance by restricting what participants can do.
This approach has attracted major institutional players like BlackRock and State Street, which collectively have more than $15 trillion in assets under management. Many crypto enthusiasts view such restrictions as betraying the technology's promise. These compromises are not just pragmatic choices – they're necessary for any system that aims to guarantee regulatory compliance.
The Securities and Exchange Commission's mandate to protect investors while facilitating capital formation has grown increasingly complex in the digital age. Under Gary Gensler's leadership, the SEC took an enforcement-heavy approach to crypto markets, treating most digital assets as securities requiring strict oversight. While Atkins' anticipated principles-based approach might seem more accommodating, it cannot change the underlying mathematical constraints that make automated compliance impossible in permission-less, fully programmable systems.
The limitations of fully automated systems became painfully clear at MakerDAO, one of the largest decentralized lending platforms with over $10 billion in assets. During March 2024's market turbulence, when Bitcoin's price swung 15% in hours, MakerDAO's automated systems began triggering a cascade of forced liquidations that threatened to collapse the entire platform.
Despite years of refinement and over $50 million spent on system development, the protocol required emergency human intervention to prevent a $2 billion loss. Similar incidents at Compound and Aave, which together handle another $15 billion in assets, underscore that this wasn't an isolated case. This wasn't just a technical failure – it demonstrates the impossibility of programming systems to handle every potential scenario while maintaining regulatory compliance.
The industry now faces three paths forward, each with distinct implications for investors:
First, follow JPMorgan's lead by building permission-based systems that sacrifice some decentralization for clear regulatory compliance. This approach has already gained significant traction: six of the top ten global banks have launched similar initiatives in 2024, collectively handling over $2 trillion in transactions. The surge in regulated crypto products, from ETFs to tokenized securities, further validates this path.
Second, limit blockchain systems to simple, predictable operations that can be automatically verified for compliance. This is the approach adopted by Ripple with its newly launched RUSD, designed to be compliant with the New York Department of Financial Services standards based on thelimited purpose trust company framework. While this constrains innovation due to the restriction action space that users can make, it enables decentralization within carefully defined boundaries.
Third, continue pursuing unlimited programmability while accepting that such systems cannot provide strong regulatory guarantees. This path, chosen by platforms like Uniswap with its over $1 trillion intotal trading volume in 2024, faces mounting challenges. Recent regulatory actions against similar platforms in Singapore, the U.K. and Japan suggest this approach's days may be numbered in developed markets.
For investors navigating this evolving landscape, the implications are clear. The current market enthusiasm, largely driven by regulated products like ETFs, indicates the industry is moving toward the first option. Projects that acknowledge and address these fundamental constraints, rather than fighting them, are likely to thrive. This explains why traditional financial institutions' blockchain initiatives, despite their limitations, are seeing dramatic growth – JPMorgan's platform reported a 127% increase in transaction volume this year.
The success stories in crypto's next chapter will likely be hybrid systems that balance innovation with practical constraints. Investment opportunities exist in both regulated platforms that provide clear compliance guarantees and innovative projects that thoughtfully limit their scope to achieve verifiable safety properties.
As this market matures, understanding these mathematical constraints becomes crucial for investors' risk assessment and portfolio allocation. The evidence is already clear in market performance: regulated crypto platforms have delivered average returns of 156% over the past year, while unrestricted platforms face increasing volatility and regulatory risks.
Atkins' principles-based approach might offer more flexibility than Gensler's prescriptive rules, but it cannot override the fundamental limits of automated compliance. Just as physics constrains what's possible in the physical world, these mathematical principles set immutable boundaries in financial technology. The impossible dream isn't cryptocurrency itself – it's the notion that we can have unrestricted programmability, complete decentralization and guaranteed regulatory compliance all at once.
For the crypto industry to deliver on its revolutionary potential, it must first acknowledge these immutable constraints. The winners in this next phase won't be those promising to overcome these mathematical limits, but those who design intelligent ways to work within them.",91531.76,0.02,91706.2,0.21,91738.7,0.24,91869.77,0.39,91515.56
39470,2018-07-06 11:21:00,All 30 Dow Stocks Ranked by Tenure in the Index,"For122 years, the storiedDow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI)has stood above practically all other stock indexes. A big reason is that it's the second-oldest stock index, behind only theDow Transportation Index, which preceded it by two years. Nevertheless, when Wall Street and investors attempt to get a feel for the breadth of the market and the overall state of the U.S. economy, the Dow is often the index they turn to.
Yet throughout the years, the Dow has gone through some big changes. When originally launched on May 26, 1896, the index had just 12 members. It was expanded to 20 components on Oct. 4, 1916, and got its 30-component limit it has today on Oct. 1, 1928.
Image source: Getty Images.
Since its inception, the Dow has undergone more than 50 changes -- i.e., companies being added and/or removed from the index -- to keep up with a dynamic U.S. economy. Sometimes these changes were very simple, with a single company being added and a corresponding company being removed. Then, there were moments like on April 1, 1901, when five companies from the 12-component index were dropped in favor of five new companies.
Throughout the Dow's history, the closest thing to a constant has beenGeneral Electric(NYSE: GE). General Electric was an original member of the Dow and, following two brief stints outside the index, had been a regular member for more than 110 years. However, GE's tenure in the Dowcame to an unsurprising closeon June 26, 2018. After losing more than 60% of its value over the trailing-two-year period, and with the Dow being a price-weighted index (General Electric's share price of $13 hardly registered), GE's days were numbered.
With stalwart GE stepping aside, a new class of tenured Dow components have risen the ranks.

Below is a list of all 30 current Dow components ranked, according to the date they were added, or most recently added (assuming they've bounced in and out of the index like GE), to the index.
1. ExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM): Added Oct. 1, 1928
2. Procter & Gamble(NYSE: PG): Added May 26, 1932

26. Goldman Sachs: Added Sept. 23, 2013
27. Nike: Added Sept. 23, 2013
28. Visa: Added Sept. 23, 2013
29. Apple: Added March 19, 2015
30. Walgreens Boots Alliance: Added Jun. 26, 2018
As you'll note, a third of the components have only been part of the Dow for the past 14 years. Just four components -- ExxonMobil, Procter & Gamble, DowDuPont, and United Technologies -- have been included for more than 42 consecutive years.
Image source: Getty Images.
With GE's departure, oil and gas giant ExxonMobilnow stands at the front of the pack. When October rolls around, it'll hit its 90th anniversary in the Dow, albeit it was known as the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey when it was first added in 1928. According to David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the committee that makes decisions to move companies in and out of the Dow, consumer, finance, healthcare, and technology companies are playing a more prominent role in today's economy. Nevertheless, ExxonMobil's status within the Dow appears solid given its importance in global energy production.
Stalwarts Procter & Gamble and United Technologies probably aren't going anywhere, either, thanks to their diversification. Since consumption accounts for around 70% of U.S. GDP, and Procter & Gamble owns a small army of brand-name households products, such as Tide detergent and Crest toothpaste, it's a company that has staying power.
Then there's United Technologies, with its four main operating segments -- Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, Otis Elevator, UTC Aerospace Systems, and UTC Climate, Controls & Security -- each contributing in the neighborhood of 20% to 30% to its annual sales. This allows United Technologies to get its fingers in numerous sectors and industries.
DowDuPont, on the other hand, may soon give up its spot near the head of the table. Dow Chemical and DuPont completed their merger last year in order to save more than $3 billion in cost synergies, and to create three global powerhouses in agriculture, specialty products, and material sciences. By sometime in early to mid-2019, DowDuPont plans tobreak up into three separate companies. This breakup could mean expulsion from the Dow and yet another change, although that'll be up to the index committee to decide.
But for the time being, it appears as though ExxonMobil, P&G, and United Technologies will be sticking around for years or decades to come.

58317,2021-01-26 23:50:24,Stocks tumble on recovery fears; dollar climbs,"By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks fell around the world on Wednesday as investors turned more cautious over stretched valuations and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the dollar rose on its safe-haven appeal. Oil prices were little changed as demand concerns were mostly offset by a large drop in U.S. crude inventories. Stocks in the United States added to losses after the Federal Reserve left its key rate near zero and made no change to its monthly bond purchases, while flagging a potential slowdown in the pace of the economic recovery. Wall Street had been weighed earlier by a slump in Boeing Co and by hedge funds dumping long positions to cover a short squeeze in GameStop Corp and AMC Entertainment. ""Fears are circulating that some investment funds might be quickly closing out positions as a way of shoring up their cash,"" said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK. ""It is early days yet but we might see selling pressure ramp up for fear there could be a stampede for the exit."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.05%, the S&P 500 lost 2.57% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.61%. MSCI's benchmark for global equity markets fell 2.04% to 652.5, while its index for emerging markets stocks fell 1.25%. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.16% after the German government slashed its growth forecast for this year, while talk of further interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank hit banking stocks and the euro. In currency trading, the dollar index rose 0.47%, with the euro down 0.4% to $1.2111. ""I think if anything the dollar is finding support from the Fed's more cautious message,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. ""I would say that the Fed having noted the recent moderation in the pace of the recovery is adding to concerns about the near-term outlook. The risk-off move today has gained traction in the Fed's more cautious outlook for growth."" The Japanese yen weakened 0.47% versus the greenback at 104.09 per dollar. In emerging markets, currencies in Russia, Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa all lost over 1% on the day versus the greenback. U.S. Treasury yields slid in line with weaker stocks as risk appetite hit a wall. ""(The Fed) did sound a little bit more downbeat, a little bit more concerned about the pace of the recovery and the pace of progress on vaccinations as well,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities in New York. ""I think it's meant to convey that they still realize there's still quite a bit of weakness and that we've a long way to go before the recovery really takes off."" Story continues Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 9/32 in price to yield 1.011%, from 1.04% late on Tuesday. In commodities markets, oil prices were little changed despite a massive drawdown in U.S. crude inventories, as ongoing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic tempered buying interest. Brent crude futures fell $0.42 to $55.49 a barrel. U.S. crude futures slid $0.04 to $52.57 a barrel. Gold prices fell, pressured in part by the dollar strength. Spot gold dropped 0.5% to $1,841.13 an ounce. Silver fell 1.13% to $25.16. Bitcoin last fell 3.91% to $31,234.68.

32805,2018-05-23 11:09:00,Why Apple Is a Great Dividend Growth Stock,"You probably already know that getting paid to own a stock (i.e.receiving a dividend) is pretty great. You know what's even better? Having that payment grow over time.
Here's where a popular method of investing commonly known asdividend growth investingcomes in. In a nutshell, a dividend growth investor looks to invest in stocks that pay significant dividends and can both sustain those dividends and grow them for the foreseeable future.
One stock that every dividend growth investor should consider for his or her portfolio isApple(NASDAQ: AAPL), as it ticks all the right boxes.
Image source: Apple.
As of this writing, the company behind the iPhone pays a dividend of $0.73 per share each quarter, or $2.92 annually, which works out to a yield of around 1.56%. This isn't the highest you'll find among potential dividend growth stock candidates, nor is it even close to the highest-yielding tech stock out there, but it's a respectable payout roughly in line with theS&P 500.
Perhaps more importantly, though, Apple's dividend is sustainable. Generally speaking, dividend payments come out of a company'sfree cash flow. So, to try to understand how sustainable a dividend is, we need to look at how much cash the company generates and compare that to the amount it pays out in dividends.
The percentage off free cash flow used to cover the company's dividend expense is known as the cash dividend payout ratio. The smaller the percentage, the more sustainable the dividend is (since it's more likely to be maintained even during a significant business downturn).
AAPL free cash flow per share (TTM). Data byYCharts.
Apple's current dividend payout ($2.92) represents just 28% of the company's overall free cash flow per share ($10.41). Income investors should take comfort that Apple could cover its dividend expense several times over out of the cash it generates.
Since Apple pays out just 28% of its free cash flow per share in the form of a dividend, it could increase its payout -- and do so quite substantially -- by simply choosing to allocate more of its free cash flow to the dividend.
While I think this is a possibility, Apple seems to prioritizeshare repurchasesbecause management thinks the stock is undervalued.
The good news, though, is that Apple's free cash flow per share has been trending up over the last 10 years (with some lumpiness here and there). So, if you believe thatthe company has significant growth potential left, then you'd have reason to believe that the company's overall free cash flow will go up as well. Even if Apple chooses to hold their cash dividend payout ratio constant, increasing cash flow would lead to further dividend increases.
Another thing to consider is that Apple has been aggressively repurchasing stock and even announced that its board of directors had authorized yet another share repurchase program good for $100 billion worth of the stock. Share repurchases have the nice effect of increasing free cash flow per share because the share count comes down. Higher free cash flow per share should ultimately translate into a fatter dividend for stockholders.
AAPL average diluted shares outstanding (annual). Data byYCharts
So, with the combination of potentially increasing free cash flow, a shrinking share count, and room for Apple to funnel more of its free cash flow per share to the dividend, dividend growth investors should find plenty to like here.

77508,2024-12-05 15:01:18,"Bitcoin price rockets past $100,000 for 1st time as Trump signals support for cryptocurrency","The price of Bitcoinsurpassed $100,000 for the first time Thursdayamid expectations thatDonald Trumpwill create a friendly regulatory environment forcryptocurrencieswhen heheads to the White House next year.
The milestone was reached amid Trump's announcement that he would be nominating Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who isexpected to bring market deregulation. The president-elect had promised on the campaign trail to replaceoutgoing chairman Gary Gensler, an appointee of President Joe Biden whose enforcement efforts led to clashes with Wall Street.
Trump had also vowed ata July bitcoin conference in Nashvilleto create a crypto-friendly administration and overhaul U.S. policy, including plans for a new crypto advisory council.
The president-elect celebrated − and took credit for − the milestone in apost on his Truth Social platformThursday morning: ""CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!!""
What is Bitcoin?Should you invest in cryptocurrency? Here's how it works
Excitement about a crypto-friendly administration hasfor months been pushing Bitcoin, the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, to itslong-awaited $100,000 milestone.
Cryptocurrency, which is 16 years old, is a digital currency and does not rely on banks to verify transactions.
Bitcoin more than doubled in value this year and has soared over 45% since the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election, which has also seen a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers being elected to Congress. Since Trump's sweeping victory, traders have bet that Trump's stated commitment to support cryptocurrencies would lead to a less restrictive regulatory environment, lifting the sector overall, Reuters reported.
Trump courted support and campaign donations from the sector with promises to be a ""crypto president"" and end Biden's crackdown on crypto companies that regulators accused of flouting securities and anti-money laundering laws.
The industry is pushing for executive orders guaranteeing crypto companies' access to banking services, an end to enforcement actions and other changes.
The Bitcoin benchmark comes in the same week that Trump announced hisnomination of Paul Atkinsto lead the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Atkins, 66, is the CEO and founder of Patomak Global Partners, a financial consulting firm withclients that include cryptocurrency firmsand exchanges.
Atkins is well-known as a pro-business former federal regulator who is friendly toward the budding cryptocurrency industry. He's also familiar among Republican business circles and the co-chairman of the Digital Chamber's Token Alliance, which has advocated for Bitcoin and other digital currencies by fighting SEC regulations that target the industry.
Gensler, who has held the position for four years and who regularly took on the crypto industry,will step down in January.
Trump himself has dabbled in cryptocurrency. He released crypto-based digital trading cards – and Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates Truth Social, is reportedly close to acquiring crypto trading firm Bakkt. The Trump family launched its own crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, in September.

266,2013-12-14 13:21:00,That Swedish Bitcoin Mining Company Has Sold $28 Million-Worth Of Its New Mining Hardware,"KnCMiner
Bitcoin businesses are booming, especially now that42% of Americans know what Bitcoin is— but there remain few businesses as revenue-rich as Bitcoin mining development.
Background: Bitcoins are mined by computers unscrambling blocks of ""hashes"" or complex strings of numbers and letters. This tends to be an expensive and labor-intensive proposition — the fastest miners now cost thousands of dollars, and they eat up lots of electricity and manhours of setup.
We recentlyreportedthat Knc Miner, a Swedish developer of Bitcoin miners, had sold $8 million of its latest model, the Neptune, in 24 hours. When it drops in early 2014 (the date remains a bit amorphous), the Neptune could be the most powerful and efficient miner in the world, depending on what the competition looks like at that time (it's impossible to say how many Bitcoins it can mine because the mining difficulty rate, which goes upward as more Bitcoins are mined, will have changed when it's released).
Today, we got new figures on Neptune sales: t he first 1,200 Neptunes were sold exclusively to existing customers, at a price of $10,000 for a total of $12 million, Ian Chaffee, a press rep for the company, told us in an email.
The next batch of 1,200 were sold to new customers for $12,999 each, for a total of $15,598,800.
That gets them to a grand total of $27,598,800, excluding taxes.
The figure nearly matches the company's entire revenues for its first seven months of production and sales of its earlier models, Chaffee says.
It's not clear how the margins on one of these babies is —Alex Lawn, a KnC employee who recently came by BI's officesto demonstrate an earlier model, would only tell us the retail price is enough to cover the costs.
But it's a sign of how far Bitcoin's come.

98149,2024-04-30 15:00:00,FameEX Highlights Emerging Trends as Crypto Industry Nears Mainstream Evolution,"Melbourne, Australia, April 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As entering the year 2024, the cryptocurrency industry is experiencing a series of groundbreaking developments that signify a pivotal turning point. Notably, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs by various countries and the record-breaking rise in Bitcoin's ATH price are milestones that are likely to be remembered in the annals of crypto history. According toFameEXResearch, these developments come at a time when the global economy is showing signs of strain and geopolitical conflicts are intensifying. This critical period demands robust preparation to shield the crypto market from potential shocks while strategically repositioning it for its inevitable transition from a niche market to a mainstream financial phenomenon.
Regulatory Approvals Catalyze Market Maturation
The approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs marks a significant advancement in regulatory acceptance and the maturation of the cryptocurrency market. FameEX Research analysts believe that this regulatory milestone has dramatically accelerated the 'mainstreaming' of cryptocurrencies. Previously, the market was largely dominated by retail and smaller institutional investors. However, post-approval, heavyweight financial institutions with trillions of dollars in assets under management have begun to engage with the cryptocurrency sector. This influx of institutional investment not only enhances the adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial ecosystem but also significantly boosts long-term confidence and the public perception of the crypto market.
The Market Evolves Toward Diversification and Scenario-Based Applications
The year 2024 stands as a critical watershed between the initial explosive growth and the impending maturity of the cryptocurrency industry. The FameEX Research delineates the industry's evolution into stages from its nascent beginnings, through rapid and unchecked expansion in order to approach a phase of maturity and eventual stabilization. As markets across the globe open up and traditional financial institutions enter the crypto space, the industry is expected to evolve towards greater scenario-based application and diversification. This evolution is anticipated to be marked by the emergence of blockchain applications—innovative technologies and platforms that could dramatically alter how cryptocurrencies are utilized, thus driving significant changes across the entire crypto industry.
The Evolving Role of Cryptocurrency Exchanges
In response to these industry-wide changes, cryptocurrency exchanges are also undergoing a transformation in their operational roles. FameEX, for instance, is advancing beyond its initial role as a mere aggregation platform for trading. It is strategically repositioning itself to become a fully diversified and comprehensive service provider. This transformation is aimed at preparing the exchange to better manage potential market volatilities and to support the broadening of cryptocurrency mainstreaming. At the core of FameEX's strategic shift is a commitment to serve its users and the broader market more effectively. The exchange is enhancing its service offerings, encompassing everything from basic trading functions to more sophisticated trading simulations, comprehensive troubleshooting, tutorials, and extensive training programs. These initiatives are designed to ensure that investors can transition smoothly from beginners to experienced traders, aligning with FameEX's mission to take from users, give back to users, and provide a stable, fast, deep, and simple trading and service experience.
As the cryptocurrency market transitions towards mainstream acceptance, entities like FameEX play a crucial role in shaping its future trajectory. By adopting strategic changes and enhancing service capabilities, FameEX is poised to facilitate a smoother integration of cryptocurrencies into the broader financial landscape, ensuring that it remains resilient and vibrant in the face of future challenges and opportunities.

(NASDAQ:EBON) (""Ebang"") that a securities fraud class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of those who purchased or acquired Ebang securitiesbetween June 26, 2020 and April 5, 2021, inclusive (the ""Class Period"").
Investor Deadline Reminder: Investors who purchased or acquired Ebang securitiesduring the Class Period may,no later than June 7, 2021, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. For additional information or to learn how to participate in this litigation please contact Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP: James Maro, Esq. (484) 270-1453 or Adrienne Bell, Esq. (484) 270-1435; toll free at (844) 887-9500; via e-mail atinfo@ktmc.com;orclickhttps://www.ktmc.com/ebang-international-class-action-lawsuit?utm_source=PR&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=ebang
Ebang is a leading application-specific integrated circuit chip design company and a leading manufacturer of Bitcoin mining machines.
According to the complaint, on April 6, 2021, before the market opened, Hindenburg Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Ebang was directing proceeds from its initial public offering last year into a ""series of opaque deals with insiders and questionable counterparties."" The report also noted that Ebang's earlier efforts to go public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange had failed due to widespread media coverage of a sales inflation scheme with Yindou, a Chinese peer-to-peer online lending platform that defrauded 20,000 retail investors in 2018, with $655 million ""vanish[ing] into thin air."" Following this news, Ebang's share price fell $0.82, or approximately 13%, to close at $5.53 per share on April 6, 2021.
Then, on April 6, 2021, after the market closed, Ebang issued a statement stating that, though it believed the report ""contain[ed] many errors, unsupported speculations and inaccurate interpretations of events,"" the ""Board, together with its Audit Committee, intends to further review and examine the allegations and misinformation therein and will take whatever necessary and appropriate actions may be required to protect the interest of its shareholders."" The stock price continued to decline over the next trading session by $0.38, or 7%, to close at $5.03 per share on April 8, 2021.
The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, the defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the proceeds from Ebang's public offerings had been directed to low yield, long term bonds to an underwriter and to related parties rather than used to develop Ebang's operations; (2) Ebang's sales were declining, and Ebang had inflated reported sales, including through the sale of defective units; (3) Ebang's attempts to go public in Hong Kong had failed due to allegations of embezzling investor funds and inflated sales figures; (4) Ebang's purported cryptocurrency exchange was merely the purchase of an out-of-the-box crypto exchange; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, the defendants' positive statements about Ebang's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.
Ebang investors may,no later than June 7, 2021, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP, or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed as a lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member's claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.
Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP prosecutes class actions in state and federal courts throughout the country involving securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duties and other violations of state and federal law. Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP is a driving force behind corporate governance reform, and has recovered billions of dollars on behalf of institutional and individual investors from the United States and around the world.

72715,2022-01-27 14:36:12,Euro Breaks Multi-Year Bottom with More Weakness to Follow,"The Euro is trading at a multi-month low against the U.S. Dollar on Thursday after the Federal Reserve said it is likely to raise U.S. interest rates in March as expected and later launch a significant reduction in its asset holdings.
The combined moves, along with reaffirmed plans to end its bond purchases in March, will complete a pivot away from the loose U.S. monetary policy that has defined the pandemic era and toward a more urgent fight against inflation.
At 14:13 GMT, the EUR/USD is trading 1.1152, down 0.0091 or -0.81%. On Wednesday,Invesco CurrencyShares Euro Trust ETF (FXE)settled at $104.40, down $0.62 or -0.59%.
The Euro is also being pressured by tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine, which is drawing investors into the safe-haven U.S. Dollar.
Tensions remained high despite diplomatic efforts to bring an end to the brewing conflict. Earlier in the week, NATO said it was putting forces on standby and reinforcing Eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets in response to Russia’s troop build-up near its border with Ukraine. Meanwhile, 8,500 U.S. troops were put on alert to deploy to Europe in the event of an escalation.
The main trend is down according to the daily swing chart. The downtrend was reaffirmed earlier today when sellers took out the November 24, 2021 main bottom at 1.1186 and the June 19, 2020 main bottom at 1.1168.
The break through 1.1168 has put the May 25, 2020 main bottom at 1.0871 on the radar. We don’t expect to see this level reached over the short-run, but traders should be aware of the fact that there is no major support until this level.
The speed at which the EUR/USD reaches this level, if at all, will be determined by whether the Ukraine/Russia conflict escalates into a full-blown war, how aggressive the Fed attacks inflation and whether the European Central Bank decides to reign in economic support and begin raising rates.

53341,2021-05-16 14:40:40,Why a billionaire couldn't get the truck he wanted — then had to pay more for a used one,"Soaring post-pandemic demand is so acute that even a billionaire is having a hard time getting the car he wants.
In a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, Jeffrey Gundlach, the founder and CEO of DoubleLine Capital, recounted how he's experiencedthe rising prices of used cars first-hand. Amid a worldwidesemiconductor shortagethat's hamperednew car productionand squeezed supply everywhere, the economic ""distortions"" put the wealthy bond investor in an uncharacteristically tough spot.
""I actually bought a truck a couple of weeks ago. And the lot, the car dealer's a big car dealership, they had no new trucks. There weren't any,"" Gundlach recalled.
Because of the chip shortage, ""all he had on his entire lot were used trucks,"" the investor added — meaning he had to settle for a used one.
According to Gundlach, the truck he purchased had 8,000 miles on it, but was only $2,000 less than the sticker price of a brand new truck.
""The fella who sold it to me, he claimed, and I think I believe him, that he was doing me a favor because he probably could have sold that truck — thanks to shortages — for more than the manufacturer's sticker price,"" he added.
Gundlach's anecdote is becoming more typical in a world where COVID-19 is still raging, but the U.S. economy is poised for record-shattering growth that's stoking the beast of inflation.
In fact, the price forused cars and trucksjumped a staggering 10.0% in April, and is up 21% in the last 12 months, according to theBureau of Labor StatisticsConsumer Price Index (CPI) data released on Wednesday.
Excluding food and energy, core inflation jumped 0.9% last month, the largest monthly increase since 1982. On a year over year basis, headline prices surged by faster-than-expected 4.2% in April, its largest gain since September 2008.
According to Gundlach, DoubleLine's model suggests inflation ""is probably going to go higher in the next couple of months"" and might peak in July.
""If we keep going higher from there, then I think people are going to be seriously worried because the concept of transitory has everything to do with what they call the base effects,"" Gundlach said.
""It's almost like a Mount Whitney is right next to Death Valley for a reason,"" he said, referencing the California mountain that's the tallest in the state.
""The hole in the ground — the dirt has to go somewhere. Inflation got so low that it was a natural rebound,"" Gundlach stated.

And my answer is always the same.
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
• 7 Best Stocks to Buy Until the Next Seismic Shift
We believe everyone should buy at least a little Bitcoin.
You see, Bitcoin and the blockchain – the technology behind Bitcoin – are about to change the world.
But a lot of people still don’t understand how they work,so they avoid buying them,which means they’re missing out on the ability to profit from them.
Bitcoin is becoming more mainstream, and it’s now a topic of regular day-to-day conversations. But many people still claim that Bitcoin isn’t real or that it’s primarily used by criminals.
Bitcoin is just a cryptographically secure medium of exchanging value. It’s not a fraud or a vehicle for criminals.
A distributed ledger called the blockchain is at the core of Bitcoin technology. The blockchain is public and accessible to everyone, just like the internet.
Bitcoin can be moved around. It’s used to buy goods and services, and it’s scarce. Only 21 million Bitcoin will ever be mined.
I would categorize Bitcoin assimilarto U.S. dollars, sterling, yen or any other currency. It is a form of currency that’s somewhere between, say, dollars and gold.
And Bitcoin isn’t controlled by any central organization. For example, it’s not controlled by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the Bank of England or the European Central Bank.
It doesn’t have a company, a CEO, or a chief financial officer.
Cryptocurrencies will become more important simply because they’re not controlled by governments.
But very few people actually own any Bitcoin.
That’s likely because buying Bitcoin is still relatively cumbersome. Exchanges need to do know-your-customer (KYC) checks. Depending on where you live, funding a Bitcoin account can require a trip to the bank and an expensive bank transfer. And you still need to familiarize yourself with a new asset class, which takes some effort.
By asking, “Should I buy Bitcoin?,” you’re already ahead of a lot of folks.
Now, I’m not saying Bitcoin won’t be volatile. Bitcoin is just a decade old and has already seen a dozen price rallies of nearly 100% and just as many selloffs.
But the crypto revolution is just beginning… and there are fortunes to be made.
In short, if you’re asking yourself, “Should I buy Bitcoin?” The answer is yes! I believe everyone should buy Bitcoin today.
The most appropriate course of action for the majority of investors is simplyto buy alittleBitcoinand forget about it. Don’t overreach and buy more than you can afford to lose. Just buy, hold and ignore the volatility.
Bitcoin is an asymmetric bet. If it falls or even goes to zero, your loss will be small, assuming you’ve put in only what you can afford to lose. But if over the next few years it continues to go up, then gains of 10 to 20 times are entirely possible. There is no other asset class on earth that offers this kind of return profile.
So everyone needs to familiarize themselves with the process of buying bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are here to stay. And being on the outside (and not understanding them) will limit your ability to profit from them.
Good investing,
Eric Wade
P.S.If you’ve been wondering “Should I buy Bitcoin?” – I firmly believe that now is a great time to buy… andthis is a great way to get started. You’ll learn what you need to know about Bitcoin and cryptos. We’ll show you the basics of investing, step-by-step… and the best cryptos to buy today.You’ll thank yourself later.

4096,2019-11-15 05:39:20,A Noxious Combination Of Weak Data And Trade Talk Uncertainty Have Sullied The Landscape,"The latest activity, employment, and growth data out of China, Australia, and Japan are suggesting the tariff knock-on effect is worse than expected as economic conditions refuse to adjust to trend. And despite the deluge of central bank easing, business investment is not responding as expected.
So, when Thursday’s miscellany of US data failed to inspire, traders further reduced short bond markets bets sending the critical US 10-year Treasury yield tumbling to 1.80 %, taking its declines to over 10 basis points this week as traders pared-back reflationary bets. Indeed, it’s stairs up for US yields and the express elevator down on the noxious combination of tariff rollback uncertainly and weaker macro data.
More back and forth over the status of ‘Phase One,’ with the Financial Times reporting that the US and China are struggling to wrap up the talks US and China struggle to finalize ‘phase one’ trade deal
There are some recriminations, with the US claiming that China is delaying the deal, which would seem to play into the view that President Trump is under pressure, having effectively announced a deal a couple of weeks ago. These are complex, long-term issues, so it should be no surprise that Phase One is hard to close. The big question should be about what comes next. How long will Phase Two take?
Trade talk uncertainty is headline risk, whereas weak data is a macro risk. The worse than expected economic numbers are providing a stark reminder just how dire global economic conditions are and how necessary a rollback in a significant chunk of US tariffs are needed to adjust the listing ship.
Not to mention that the Chinese economy needs a policy jolt. Growth has fizzled over recent quarters, and, broadly, we are back down to 2015 cyclical lows, if not below.
Here’s the thing, as bad as the latest run of backward-looking data is, still we’re likely only a positive trade talk development headlines away from sending the market skywards again. And perhaps the worse than expected evidence has added just enough premium to that potentially massive tariff rollback payout significantly enough to offset the lower probability of that dividend-paying out after President Trumps NY speech. One would have to think that worsening economic data would motivate both the US and China to get back to the negotiation table and not only agree to a tariff rollback but that critical enforcement mechanism.
One look at the frothyUS equity marketsuggests investors are hanging on and even adding to that tariff rollback optimism trade.
Honestly, for investors’ well-being, lets hope trade talks all go according to the script. Otherwise, if US-China trade negotiations turn south and there is no détente, bond term premium retraces the .45 % improvement of the past couple of months while equity market will likely collapse.
The flipside is also notable. If a trade negotiation is reached, there is likely upside to the .4-.6 % range, which could take us beyond 2.10% 10-year UST yield, but it will require a definite phase 2 roadmap to get us there. At current levels, the risks – both to the upside and downside – seem to reasonably well priced at current levels.
Hong Kong descent into mobocracy has taken a significant turn for the worse as populism paralysis ensnared the city this week. And well beyond the financial market upheaval and capital flights that play a distant second and third fiddle to human welfare concerns. The US senate is quickly setting up the passage of the Hong Kong Democracy bill by placing the city’s special trading status with the U.S. under annual review. In the past, the US and China have compartmentalized political issues away from tariff talks, like what has been done with Huawei, although the Hong Kong issues are exponentially more significant than Huawei. But it’s unclear e if this will be the case on the Hong Kong mega issue.
Given that China has said they will retaliate to any US interference, I wonder just how forcefull that retaliation will be when they are clearly losing this battle in the global court of public opinion. I’m not sure China wants to improve President Trump’s approval rating anytime soon.
Oil prices gave upsome hard-earned gains after US Crude stocks rose 2.2Mb, bearish vs. consensus for a 1.6Mb Whatever momentum was gained this week from OPEC jawboning and when putting it within in the context of a seemingly never-ending run of US inventory builds. Bullish for oil OPEC ambitions are still running into decent supply glut offers, keeping the bulk of price action confined to the WTI mid-level zone between USD 55.75 – 57.75 per barrel as we patiently await the next trade talk headline.
The EIA publishes its November Drilling productivity report next week (18 November). The report will provide the market with excellent growth assumptions in the short term. Drilling and completion activity, as well as rig productivity forecasts, will be of interest as the industry resorts to DUC drawdowns to support short-term growth as rig counts fall.
Gold has made of blow-off bottom in recent days, first triggered by trade talk uncertainty, then supported by a run of virulent macro global data and framed by influential Fed Williams saying US monetary policy is trying to keep the economy in a good place. “Keep” is the key here as it suggests the Fed is not straying too far from the rate cut lever. If the US economy needs additional stimulus, then there is policy space.
Whilegold remains an excellent defensive strategyagainst trade tensions, resurfacing, and intensifying. But in the absence of a definitive shift lower in Fed policy, rallies above $1480, which is needed to confirm a buying trend has re-emerged, might be hard-pressed in the absence of a dovish Fed.
On a positive note, some considerable long positioning has been squared up in the past two weeks, emboldening buyers as the threat of a long position squeeze has lessened. Still, in the event of a positive trade headline, that we may need to assume coming, critical support is expected to come in at $1445 from a technical perspective.
With US bond yields falling and the negative shift in trade talk headline risk, key 108.50 gave way triggering retail stop-loss orders. But with positioning looking much cleaner at current levels, a USD bid has started to re-emerge as traders may begin viewing the US exceptionalism index (QQQ vs. EEM), which might start to look attractive to theUSDJPY bulls.
The ringgit is trading weaker weighted down by equity market outflows, weak economic data out of China, and uncertainly over trade talks. Traders will now look to Malaysia GDP print for monetary policy clues, but with the market singular focused on the trade talks, the GDP print may need to blow out the expectation to get a significant rise from the ringgit bulls.

58347,2020-09-14 21:24:00,Red River Capital Corp and Bitcoin Solutions Announce Proposed Qualifying Transaction,"Calgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - September 14, 2020) - Further to the news release issued June 2, 2020 by Red River Capital Corp. (TSXV: XBT.P) (""Red River"" or the ""Corporation""), Red River and 1739001 Alberta Ltd. o/a Bitcoin Solutions (""Bitcoin Solutions"") are pleased to announce that they have entered into a share purchase agreement (the ""Agreement"") dated September 11, 2020 among the Corporation, Bitcoin Solutions and shareholders of Bitcoin Solutions (the ""Bitcoin Solutions Shareholders"") to complete a reverse takeover whereby Red River will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Bitcoin Solutions in consideration for the issuance of common shares of the Corporation (the ""Acquisition"").
Red River intends that the Acquisition will constitute its Qualifying Transaction, as such term is defined in the Policy 2.4 -Capital Pool Companies(the ""CPC Policy"") of the TSX Venture Exchange (the ""Exchange""). The Corporation, upon completion of the Acquisition, expects to change its name to ""Bitcoin Well Inc."" or such other name as may be approved by Red River and Bitcoin Solutions and is acceptable to the Exchange (the ""Name Change""). Such entity is to be referred to herein as the ""Resulting Issuer"".
Trading of the common shares of the Corporation has been halted and will remain halted in accordance with Exchange policies until all required documentation with respect to the Acquisition has been received and the Exchange is otherwise satisfied that the halt should be lifted.
Summary of the Acquisition
Pursuant to provisions of the Agreement, Red River will acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding securities of Bitcoin Solutions in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of approximately 120,250,000 common shares of Red River (the ""Red River Shares"") to the Bitcoin Solutions Shareholders at a deemed price of $0.12 per share, representing an aggregate acquisition price of approximately $14.4 million. Each holder of Bitcoin Solutions Class A Shares or Bitcoin Solutions Class B Shares will receive 8.917 Red River Shares for every Bitcoin Solutions Class A Share or Bitcoin Solutions Class B Share held, and each holder of Bitcoin Solutions Class I Shares or Bitcoin Solutions Class F Preferred Shares will receive 10 Red River Shares for every Bitcoin Solutions Class I Share or Bitcoin Solutions Class F Preferred Share held. The number of Red River Shares to be issued in connection with the Acquisition was determined pursuant to arm's length negotiations between the management and the board of directors of each of Red River and Bitcoin Solutions. As a result of the Acquisition, Bitcoin Solutions will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Red River and the Resulting Issuer will carry on the business that was conducted by Bitcoin Solutions prior to the Qualifying Transaction within the cryptocurrency industry. The Agreement also provides that the Name Change will become effective upon the closing of the Acquisition. Completion of the Acquisition and the issuance of the Red River Shares are subject to approval by the Exchange. It is anticipated that the Resulting Issuer will be listed as a Tier 1 Industrial Issuer.
In addition, each issued and outstanding stock option to purchase Bitcoin Solutions Class I Shares (""Bitcoin Solutions Option"") will be exchanged for 10 options of the Resulting Issuer (""Resulting Issuer Options""), having substantially the same terms and condition as the Bitcoin Solutions Option, and will entitle the holder thereof to acquire, upon exercise thereof, and for the consideration payable therefor, one common share of the Resulting Issuer. As of the date of this press release, there are 330,376 Bitcoin Solutions Options outstanding. The number of Resulting Issuer Options that will be issued as a result of the conversion of Bitcoin Solutions Options shall be 3,303,760. Upon closing of the Acquisition, 1,333,332 Resulting Issuer Options to certain directors and officers of the Resulting Issuer shall be issued. It is also anticipated that following closing of the Acquisition, 833,333 Resulting Issuer Shares (as defined herein) will be issued to Adam O'Brien, Chief Executive Officer and a Director of Bitcoin Solutions and the proposed Chief Executive Officer and a proposed director of the Resulting Issuer.
On closing of the Acquisition, the Resulting Issuer is expected to have approximately 125,750,000 common shares outstanding on a non-diluted basis.
In connection with the Acquisition, the Resulting Issuer will apply to list its common shares (the ""Resulting Issuer Shares"") on the Exchange.
Arm's Length Transaction
The Acquisition is arm's length and is therefore not a Non-Arm's Length Qualifying Transaction under the CPC Policy. Accordingly, the CPC Policy does not require Red River to obtain shareholder approval for the Acquisition.

20824,2021-06-26 19:00:56,State of Crypto: What’s Driving Its Meteoric Rise and Who’s Really Investing in Crypto Now,"hocus-focus / Getty Images It seems like the world has been in a crypto state of mind in the past few months, and cryptocurrencies have become easier to access for the average investor via sleek trading apps. A new GOBankingRates survey found some unique insights into who is jumping into crypto, but first let’s look at some of the factors driving adoption. See: 10 Cheap Cryptocurrencies To Check Out Find: How Does Cryptocurrency Work — and Is It Safe? One of the most notable events in the space is the meteoric rise of Bitcoin, which broke the “emotional stage” of $50,000 in February and saw its valuation reaching $1 trillion. Quite a different place from where the coin kicked off 2020 at just over $7,000. While the crypto has been extremely volatile, its adoption has accelerated. Tesla, for example, announced in February that it had purchased $1.5 billion of Bitcoin and after waffling on their stance, it still looks like they may start accepting the crypto as a form of payment in the near future . See: How to Invest in Cryptocurrency: What You Should Know Before Investing There is also increasing institutional interest, as several investment banks expressed their Bitcoin engagement, including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Morgan Stanley said in March it would offer Bitcoin to its wealthier clients, and Goldman Sachs announced the formation of a cryptocurrency trading team . See: 10 Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest in for 2021 Find: Morgan Stanley Will Offer Wealthy Clients Access to Bitcoin Funds Going even further, in a note to clients, Goldman Sachs Global Head of Digital Assets Mathew McDermott called Bitcoin an “investable asset class.” “ Bitcoin doesn’t behave as one would intuitively expect relative to other assets given the analogy to digital gold ; to date, it’s tended to be more aligned with risk-on assets. But clients and beyond are largely treating it as a new asset class, which is notable-it’s not often that we get to witness the emergence of a new asset class.” Counterpoint: Is it Too Late to Invest in Crypto? Another watershed moment was the blockbuster Coinbase IPO , one of the most anticipated IPOs of the year so far. The stock appeals to investors who want to get involved in crypto, but without holding the assets and its wild swings. Upcoming IPOs for Robinhood and eToro are driving similar anticipation . Read: The Best Trading Apps for New Investors: Robinhood and Beyond But how do these factors translate in crypto adoption for retail investors? The new GOBankingRates survey finds that 41% of Americans who invest in the stock market are also investing in cryptocurrency. Another 25% wish they could but feel like they don’t know enough, and 16% wish they could invest in crypto, but don’t have the funds. Remarkably, only 14% of current investors say they have no desire to invest in cryptocurrency. Story continues Beginner’s Guide: Cryptocurrency Jargon: A Guide for the Crypto-Curious In terms of age groups, the survey found that the age group investing the most in cryptos is the 35- to 44-year-old group, with 50.55% of respondents saying they have money in cryptocurrency. According to Nishank Khanna, Clarify Capital CFO, it makes sense that we see individuals from ages 35 to 44 investing in cryptocurrency at higher-than-average rates than other age groups. “If you think about it, individuals 35-44 are generally earning high incomes, where they may have larger amounts of disposable income than they had in their 20s or early 30s,” Khanna tells GOBankingRates. Dogecoin (DOGE): What It Is, What It’s Worth and Should You Be Investing? “As a result, they may feel more comfortable investing in a speculative asset, knowing that the future of that asset is uncertain. Their specific age range also indicates that if the speculative assets end up imploding, they should still have enough time to recover financially.” This finding is in line with crypto exchange Gemini’s recent 2021 State of Crypto in the US report, which notes that the average crypto investor is a 38-year-old male. Breaking down the age groups further, the GOBankingRates survey notes that the second largest group of crypto investors is the 25- to 34-year-old, with 47.84% investing in cryptocurrencies; followed by 18- to 24-year-olds, with 38.91% putting money in the coins. Get Started: How to Invest in Cryptocurrency With Just $1 Marie Tatibouet, CMO at global blockchain asset exchange platform Gate.io, says that these figures are a “testament to how much the crypto space has grown and matured since at least 40% of the folks in the 25-34 and 35-44 age range own crypto.” “It is no surprise that nearly 48% of the 25-34 bracket own crypto. These guys were teenagers when bitcoin entered the scene. Most of these people have seen their peers get wealthy beyond measure due to crypto and now they want their slice of the pie,” Tatibouet tells GOBankingRates. See: Millennials Own More Crypto Than Any Other Generation Finally, another key finding of the survey is that there are more male investors than female in cryptocurrencies, with 47.2% of men saying they are investing in crypto versus only 32.55% of women. Andrew Murray, GOBankingRates content data researcher, says that this was “a bit surprising.” “I expected that number to be closer between the sexes and there may be a multitude of reasons why it is so large, from the still ever-present wage gap between men and women in the workforce to general attitudes towards risk,” Murray says. More: 10 of the Most Private Crypto to Invest In Ben Weiss, CEO of CoinFlip, the largest bitcoin ATM in the US, says that women are underrepresented in crypto, much like how they are in both finance and tech. Read: Bitcoin (BTC): Learn the Basics Behind the Coin “Many view cryptocurrency as complicated and overwhelming. This is especially true for women brought up in a more traditional setting where men make all financial decisions,” Weiss says. “We take pride in playing our part to lessen the gender disparity in crypto by making bitcoin as accessible as possible and providing an easy way to obtain the financial freedom that cryptocurrency offers. The key to expanding this inclusivity across the industry will be through more education targeted at women that demystifies cryptocurrency.” More on Crypto From GOBankingRates 3 Common Crypto Misconceptions Debunked Crypto Curious but Risk Averse?

77655,2023-04-12 15:26:37,"More Than $300 Million in Ethereum Will Be Sold After Shanghai, Analysts Say","Analysts at Glassnode estimate that roughly 170,000Ethereum, worth approximately $326 million, will be sold following today's highly anticipatedShanghai upgrade.
The upgrade, also known by its consensus layer name ""Capella,"" will finally let users withdraw ETH that has been locked up on the Ethereum network over the last two years.
Ethereum began its transition to aproof-of-stakenetwork inDecember 2020, enabling validators and other interested stakers to begin earning passive rewards on ETH pledged to the network. Itcompletedthe transition last September following the ""merge,"" an upgrade that combined the Ethereum mainnet with the proof-of-stake beacon chain.
Users who've staked their Ethereum, however, haven't been able to withdraw their initial deposits or rewards. But all that changes later today.
Glassnode researchers today statedin a reportthat of the newly unlocked sum, approximately 70,000 ETH will come from validators exiting the network, pulling their staked holdings with them. The report indicates that there are 253 depositors waiting to do precisely this, but analysts added that ""withdrawals are most likely related to a change in their technical setup, rather than exiting their position.""
The remaining 100,000 ETH is expected to come from users withdrawing their staking rewards to sell on the market. Glassnode analysts said they only expect roughly $133 million worth of ETH to ""actually become liquid"" following the activation of withdrawals.
Proof-of-stake networks work by having validators secure the network, as opposed to miners on proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin. Anyone can become a validator on Ethereum by staking 32 ETH (roughly $60,000) and begin earning rewards for doing so. If a validator acts maliciously, they face a penalty known as ""slashing"" that deducts ETH from their staked sum.
Despite projecting upwards of $326 million in Ethereum potentially hitting the market, Glassnode's report concludes that the move ""is expected to be a lot less dramatic than many have painted it to be,"" adding that should the Shanghai upgrade go off without a hitch, it ""will bolster a growing staking industry.""
It's also worth noting that withdrawal requests will enter a queue, and not all withdrawal requests will be processed on day one. Individual stakers may have to wait at least two or three days before receiving their funds, and stakers making use of pooling services such as Lido or centralized providers like Coinbase might need to wait weeks if not months. This means that any ETH being withdrawn from the staking contract won't hit the market all at once.
Other analysts, including CoinShares research associate Marc Arjoon, agree that theeffects of Shanghai on the Ethereum marketwill likely be muted in the short term.
Arjoon toldDecryptthat this has a lot do with liquid staking solutions such as Lido Finance
Though withdrawals for Lido Finance are also contingent on withdrawals on Ethereum also becoming available, users have been able to swap their staked Ethereum tokens (stETH) for ETH on exchanges like Curve Finance.
When depositing Ethereum on a liquid staking platform, users get an equivalent staked version of Ethereum that can be used elsewhere in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), such us non-custodial lending and trading platforms.
Why Ethereum Bulls Are Turning to LSD
""If those takers wanted to exit the market, they could simply sell their tokens on the secondary market for a one-to-one ratio,"" he toldDecrypt.
Arjoon also believes that many of the ""tech-savvy"" stakers who have the 32 ETH needed to become validators are unlikely to sell their stashes.
""They decided to stake their ETH with an indefinite lockup period, and that's likely because they believe in using ETH as a store of value,"" said Arjoon. ""That’s why I also think that that cohort majority is unlikely to sell.”
So who's dumping their staked ETH? ""Different entities like businesses, colleges, and other things that just can't be identified using the [wallet] addresses,"" are the most likely to sell, said Arjoon. ""To be conservative, I would say that 50% of those entities would withdraw and sell their ETH.""

22308,2019-08-08 11:00:52,Bitcoin Price Looks Poised to Retest Highs Above $13K,"• Bitcoin is looking north, with the daily chart reporting a bearish channel breakout following a six-week-long correction. A retest of highs above $13,000 could be in the offing.
• The bullish case would strengthen if prices rise above $12,145, invalidating consolidation or exhaustion signaled by Wednesday’s candlestick pattern. Astronger confirmationof a bull revival would be a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000.
• A break below Wednesday’s low of $11,388 would weaken the bullish case. That level could come into play in the next 24 hours if the symmetrical triangle seen on the hourly chart is breached to the downside.
The bitcoin (BTC) market appears to have ended its six-week-long correction on Wednesday, making way for a retest of key resistance at $13,200.
The leading cryptocurrency by market value closed just above $11,940 on Bitstamp yesterday, confirming an upside break of the falling channel represented by trendlines connecting June 26 and July 10 highs and July 2 and July 17 lows.
Put simply, Wednesday’s UTC close confirmed an end of the pullback from the June 26 high of $13,880 and a revival of the bull market.

Hence, the doors look open for a rise to $13,200 – a bearish lower high created on July 10.
So far, however, BTC has not been able to capitalize on the bull breakout. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $11,850 on Bitstamp, having hit a high of $12,031 earlier today.
Traders may want to see BTC settle above $12,000 before hitting the market with fresh bids. After all, the cryptocurrency has repeatedly failed to hold onto gains above $12,000 in the last six weeks,as discussedyesterday.

The bearish channel breakout indicates the path of least resistance is to the higher side.
The breakout would gain credence if prices clear Wednesday’s high of $12,145. That would invalidate exhaustion or mark an upside break of consolidation represented by yesterday’s inside bar pattern.
An inside bar occurs when the high and low of a candlestick falls within the preceding day’s price action. Essentially, it represents consolidation after a big move (or bull exhaustion).
The bullish case put forward by the channel breakout would be invalidated if BTC prints a UTC close below the inside bar’s low of $11,388. That would confirm a bearish inside bar reversal and allow a deeper drop toward $10,000.
Crypto trader and analyst Josh Ragerarguedon Twitter “it’s far riskier being bearish at this point in time,” suggesting only a break below $11,000 would shift risk in favor of a drop to $9,000.
BTC has carved out a symmetrical triangle (narrowing price range) on the hourly chart.
A move above the upper edge of the symmetrical triangle, currently at $12,000, would imply a continuation of the rally from lows near $9,100 seen on July 28.
Symmetrical triangle breakdown, if confirmed with a move below $11,693, would expose support at $11,388 (the inside bar’s low).

47841,2022-02-28 22:18:57,Bitcoin Demand Explodes As Russian Ruble Collapses to Less Than $0.01,"• The value of Russia’s Ruble against the United States Dollar is worth less than a cent.
• To prevent a further collapse, the Russian Central Bank raised the interest rates to 20% from 9.5%
• Bitcoin purchases against the Russian Ruble rose to $1.5 billion in a single day.
The imposition of sanctions, elimination of Russia from SWIFT, European Union’s ban of Central Bank’s transactions is already beginning to affect the country’s economy.
In less than 24 hours after the US announced its sanctions and the decision of removing Russia from SWIFT, Ruble tumbled.
OneRublewas worth about 1.2 cents or $0.012 until a few hours ago. Then, however, due to the invasion ofUkraineworsening and considering the response from the world, its value fell.
Plunging by a mind-boggling 21.29% is currently worth less than a cent at $0.009.
The broader impact of this fall of value is that the Central Bank raised its key interest rates. In addition, as the Ruble’s value collapses, Russia is taking steps to avoid hyperinflation.
And for the same reason, the Bank raised its interest rates on deposits to 20%, which is higher than most of Russia’s securities and stocks.
Furthermore, the Bank is looking into ways to fight the ban and elimination from SWIFT.
Since the country cannot access any of its 14 trillion Rubles and the $1.1 trillion forex reserves, it is looking at another way. Incentivizing investors with a 20% interest rate is a step in that direction.
The State Duma deputy from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), Nikolai Arefiev, even went on tosay:
“If they block all the funds that are abroad, then the government will have no choice but to seize all the deposits of the population – there are about 60 trillion rubles – in order to get out of the situation”
Thus to save money, aspredictedby FXEmpire, the citizens have officially begun to turn tocrypto. Data fromCoindesk – Kaikoshows that over 1.5 billion Rubles worth ofBitcoinin Rubles pair was traded in just 24 hours.
Recently, the Vice Prime Minister of Ukraineappealedto every cryptocurrency exchange around the world to block and freeze the addresses of Russian and Belarusian politicians and the citizens of Russia and “sabotage” them.
As the war worsens, problems forUkrainianand Russian people will increase as their lifestyle gets much more expensive.
One can only pray that neither of the countries’ citizens ends up paying a wheelbarrow of money to buy one loaf of bread.

39905,2021-12-31 09:44:33,"Global stocks close near record highs ahead of New Year, dollar and oil dip","By Katanga Johnson and Tommy Wilkes
WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Equities around the globe traded little changed on Thursday as oil prices fell and the U.S. dollar dipped against most major currencies although it has had its best year since 2015 with a 6.7% rise.
With several markets in Asia and Europe closed on Friday, trading volumes were thin and most markets directionless.
The MSCI World Index shed 0.07%. The index has surged 17% in 2021, its third consecutive year of double-digit gains.
Analysts say the U.S. economy has proven resilient in the face of pandemic-related challenges, and many expect the global economy will still expand at a well-above-trend pace.
After initially tumbling in December, world stocks recovered over the holiday period as investors became reassured economies could handle the surge in Omicron coronavirus cases, and are heading back toward record highs.
""As far as COVID is concerned, for now, market participants may stay willing to add to their risk exposures, and perhaps push equity indices to new highs, as several nations around the globe held off from imposing fresh lockdowns, despite record infections around the globe the last few days,"" said Charalambos Pissouros, head of research at Cyprus-based brokerage JFD Group.
The dollar index fell 0.418% on Friday.
On Wall Street, New Year's Eve trading ended near record highs on Friday.
All three major U.S. stock indexes scored monthly, quarterly and annual gains, notching their biggest three-year advance since 1999.
Investors have held onto expectations for resilience in the global recovery into 2022 and the prospect of further gains if money remains cheap and corporate profitability high.
This year's ""everything rally"" has seen a wall of cheap central bank cash, government stimulus and strong economic rebounds out of the pandemic make it hard not to profit from soaring asset prices.
U.S. stocks have powered the global rally as record-breaking earnings figures from Big Tech companies excited investors. This week the S&P 500 hit another record high.
Commodity prices have enjoyed a strong year too, with supply often falling short of a jump in demand as economies reopened.
On the last day of the year however, Brent crude futures settled down $1.75, or 2.2%, at $77.78 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dropped $1.78, or 2.31%, to $75.21 a barrel.
But both Brent and WTI are up more than 50% in 2021, spurred by the global economic recovery and producer restraint.
Global oil prices are expected to rise further next year as jet fuel demand catches up.

China's factory activity unexpectedly accelerated in December, but only by a slim margin, an official survey showed, with analysts foreseeing more economic headwinds in the near term.
Chinese shares, one of the few Asian markets open on Friday, closed higher, ending a tough year on a high. The blue-chip CSI300 index has lost 5.2% this year, its worst annual performance in three years.
LIRA BACKSLIDING
The euro, which has dropped 7.4% this year as investors bet the European Central Bank would be slower to end pandemic-era stimulus than rival central banks, rose 0.1% to hold above $1.13.
Japan's yen, which has lost more than 11% to the dollar in 2021, dipped to 115.1 yen per dollar, not far off four-year lows touched this month.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.19%.
The British pound remains down for the year against the dollar but looks set for its best year since 2014 versus the euro. On Friday it rose to as high as 83.69 pence, its strongest since February 2020.
Elsewhere in currency markets, Turkey's lira - by far the biggest currency loser in 2021 - fell for a fifth straight day.
This week's falls have eroded the big gains the lira made a week earlier. Investors are concerned about the country's unorthodox monetary policy and rising inflation, and fear President Tayyip Erdogan's plan to defend lira deposits unveiled this month will not work.
Government bond markets were mostly closed.
Spot gold added 0.8% to $1,829.04 an ounce.
Bitcoin last fell 2.37%.

The brief price bounce over the past two days was limited as bitcoin (BTC) eventually dipped below $48,000, although charts suggest pullbacks could stabilize around the $46,000 support level, or the level at which buyers tend to purchase or enter into a stock.
BTC is roughly flat over the past week, compared with a 1% drop in ether (ETH), a 5% rise in Solana’sSOLtoken, and a 38% rise in Avalanche’s AVAX token over the same period. The wide dispersion in crypto returns this week suggests that investor appetite for risk remains strong. Typically, the overall crypto market begins to trend higher when alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) start to outperform bitcoin.
For now, several risks remain, which could weigh on crypto prices.
For example, the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council published areporton Friday warning Congress about stablecoin and decentralized finance (DeFi) risks. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)delayedits decision on Grayscale and Bitwise spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF), which also contributed to the sour mood in crypto markets on Friday.
• Bitcoin (BTC): $46,273, -3.8%
• Ether (ETH): $3,849, -4.5%
• S&P 500: -1.5%
• Gold: unchanged at $1,798.20
• 10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.41%, down 0.01 percentage point
The bitcoin options market is leaning more neutral/bearish over the short term.

According to the most recentBlockchain Game Reportfrom the Blockchain Game Alliance (BGA), over 804,000 unique active users connected to blockchain-based games in July. The trend indicates that while the novel industry is in the throes of speculative activity that’s driving up volatility, the gaming segment is quickly growing its user network.
Notably, the blockchain-powered game ""Axie Infinity"" dominates the sector, the BGA's data revealed. With over $1 billion in trading volume — $600 million of which came in July — the game became the most valuable collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Launched in 2018 by Vietnamese developer, Sky Mavis, Axie Infinity is a play-to-earn game inspired by the popular video game franchise, Pokemon.
And based on Google Trends, internet search for Axie Infinity doubled even that of Activision's (ACTI) hugely popular first-person shooter game franchise, “Call of Duty.”
Along with Axie’s whopping 453% increase in trading volume since June, the report suggested that sales volume often leads to growth in social media followers via Twitter and Discord.
In Axie Infinity, players can battle, breed and raise various monsters called “Axies.” Each one comes with its own unique NFT that can be raised, battled and traded.
Built on top of theEthereum blockchain, the video game allows players to earn money through game play. Axie Infinity has become increasingly popular in developing countries such as the Philippines, where players can simultaneouslybolster their cryptocurrency earningsby playing the game.
According to Token Terminal, the game’s governance token, AXS, helped Axie Infinity generate more revenue in July than any other cryptocurrency including — Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). Since the beginning of August, the price of AXS has nearly doubled, from $38 to $74.Coinbase, the major cryptocurrency exchange,listedAXS on August 11.
The report also shows that Binance Smart Chain (BSC), adigital architecture built by the eponymous crypto exchangeto be an Ethereum competitor, became the most used blockchain protocol for gaming in July, with 658,000 unique users.
BSC’s growth last month was driven most by its own native play-to-earn games — such as the battle game, CryptoBlades. Most recently, the game attracted more than 350,000 daily users.

27726,2020-07-24 15:49:21,Money Reimagined: China’s ‘Cold War’ Blockchain Strategy,"News items this week:
• In the U.S., unidentified federal officersherdedpeaceful protesters into unmarked vehicles and the governmentprepared to deliver another $1 trillion in spendingto politically connected entities.
• In China, the governmentgranted six public blockchains access to its Blockchain Services Networkand theSupreme Court called for stronger definitionsof private citizens’ digital currency property rights.
Which one is the centrally managed police state? Which one is the pro-innovation jurisdiction embracing open-source technologies and decentralized governance networks?
OK. I’m being a tad facetious. The reality is Chinese President Xi Jinping has severely concentrated power. In general, his government, with its Hong Kong crackdown and Uighur detention camps, has encroached upon people’s freedoms more than at any time since Mao Zedong’s rule. Also, the default assumption should be that China’s blockchain vision favors cryptographic backdoors, centralized master keys and transaction monitoring systems more than it does the permissionless, censorship-resistant ideals of those six blockchains – Ethereum, Tezos, NEO, Nervos, EOS and IRISnet.

Nonetheless, the contrast between China welcoming open-source, permissionless systems and the current U.S. government’s tendency toward anti-science insularity, authoritarianism and cronyism is telling.
One is thinking outside the box. The other doesn’t know it’s in a box.
China’s moves are consistent with its desire to challenge U.S. financial hegemony, an effort that revolves around its forthcoming digital currency project, known as Digital Currency Electronic Payments, or DCEP.
Related:From Enron to Wirecard: How Blockchain Tech Could Have Helped
The BSN, which will offer tools and hosting services to developers of blockchain-based applications targeted at Chinese development goals, will eventually integrate DCEP. That will bring the efficiency of programmable fiat currency into top-priority use cases such as decentralized supply chains and smart city applications.
Widening the range of blockchain protocols integrating DCEP will allow the Chinese government to spread adoption of its digital currency, helping China challenge Washington’s gatekeeping role in international finance.
(To be clear, I see very little prospect of a digital renminbi becoming a dollar-like international store of value for central banks. Rather, the DCEP’s programmable qualitiescould render redundant the very need for a reserve currency intermediaryin international transactions, allowing cross-border users to bypass the U.S. banking system.)
This comes as Chinese entities are seeking to avoid U.S. financial oversight in other ways.
Ant Group, which runs Alibaba’s Alipay mobile payments platform, this week announced its public listing will occur in Shanghai and Hong Kong but not New York.
This is a big deal. Alibaba is signaling a giant $200 billion valuation for Ant, whose Alipay service accounts for more than half of Chinese mobile payments, which are forecast to hitRMB 777 trillion ($108 trillion) in 2020. U.S.-based investors will now be denied access to this monster primary share offering.
Why would Alibaba, which in 2014 held its own record-breaking $25 billion IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, take this step?
For answers, look to Beijing and its tit-for-tat mini-Cold War with Washington.
With the Trump Administrationpressuring the U.K.into joining its ban against Chinese mobile provider Huawei’s 5G wireless business andclosing China’s Houston consulateon allegations of trade secrets theft, Xi’s government is in retaliation mode.
Excluding the Wall Street establishment from Ant’s deal is one way of retaliating. More importantly, by doing away with the Securities and Exchange Commission oversight of the company’s operations, it removes a lever U.S. regulators would otherwise have over China’s payment systems.
The DCEP’s programmable qualities could render redundant the very need for a reserve currency intermediary in international transactions.
Ant is likely to play a distribution role for the DCEP. It’s also big in the non-monetary world of blockchain; this week, Ant announced that users of its blockchain service, soon to be renamed Airchain, areuploading 100 million digital assets a day– mostly records of transactions, property and copyright claims. Excluding the company from SEC oversight is consistent with China’s resistance to allowing the U.S. any gatekeeping capacity over future blockchain-based payments and value exchange systems.
Until the digital assets era, the U.S. enjoyed uniquely influential powers over the exchange of analog money and property around the world. This was on account of the dollar’s reserve status, which meant the currency settlement in any international exchange almost always flowed through a U.S.-regulated bank. China’s blockchain-integrated digital payments system could bring an end to that era.
Ant’s listing strategy will also infuse badly needed funds into Hong Kong, where protests over China’s new security laws have left many wondering about the future of the multinational companies headquartered there.
This brings us to the other U.S.-China financial flashpoint – the Hong Kong dollar – and whether China’s embrace of public blockchains could help it preserve this vital source of financial stability.
When the Trump Administrationbriefly considered undermining the Hong Kong dollar’s peg to the U.S. dollar, some CoinDesk editors debated whether it was even possible. We concluded that while the U.S. could not directly deny the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) access to its onshore foreign currency reserves – the backstop that guarantees the local currency’s fixed U.S. dollar value – it could impede their circulation by ordering U.S. correspondent banks not to transact with Hong Kong banks.
That led us to question how a China-led HKMA might maintain its peg even if U.S. banks were blocking Hong Kong banks. The possible answer: blockchain-based stablecoins.
Hong Kong banks could use their domestic holdings of U.S. dollar reserves to back a stable-value token that circulates between blockchain addresses anywhere, all without U.S. bank intermediation. China would make those tokens interoperable with DCEP digital currency.
I’ve no knowledge such calculations lie behind China’s embrace of public blockchains. But given the surge in Ethereum’s stablecoin transactions (see the “Global Town Hall” section below), Beijing surely has its eyes on the sector. Stablecoins may provide an avenue for China to achieve monetary autonomy without destroying the region’s financial order.
The irony: China’s ability to escape U.S. control over a centrally managed digital currency, one that many fear will become a surveillance tool, could depend on decentralized systems.
Is the U.S. awake to what all this means?
Folks like Christopher Giancarlo, former Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, who this week againtestified to Congress on his Digital Dollar Project, are trying to encourage a counteractive technological initiative from Washington.
It’s not clear the message is sinking in.
In thinking about how to value new forms of money, it’s useful to consider how people value old forms of money. So, let’s look atthis post from Zero Hedgeabout the price of silver recently outperforming gold. Describing gold as “more money-like” and silver as “more commodity-like,“ the article said the recent decline in the gold-to-silver ratio (see chart below) signaled a modest improvement in economic confidence, which was fueling an early revival in inflation expectations. Interestingly, there are modest parallels in the relationship between bitcoin, often regarded as a “digital gold” store of value, and “altcoins,” some of which are often described as “commodity-like” network tokens.
Contrary to a rather simplistic view of gold as an inflation hedge, this analysis views it more broadly as a safe haven when investors become bearish about the state of the economy, which is what happened in March with the onset of the COVID-19 global lockdown and market panic. Even though this brought on expectations of deflation, gold rallied after an initial decline as the extent of the economic meltdown set in and concerns grew about the political failures. But more recently, as central bank stimulus has breathed life back into stock markets and as European and Asian economies have gradually reopened, expectations for a credit-fueled rebound in demand for commodities, and concurrently, in inflation, have grown, even as the pandemic has spread further through the U.S. Hence silver’s recent outperformance.
Interestingly, there’s a mirrored trend in bitcoin’s performance versus a number of altcoins. The outperformance has been especially pronounced for tokens such as Cardano’s ADA and Chainlink’s LINK, but it’s also evident in the classic dichotomy of bitcoin vs Ethereum’s ether.
This might seem like a bit of spurious comparison, but hear me out. Whereas many crypto community hard money advocates described bitcoin’s spring recovery from its March lows as a function of rising inflation concerns – captured in the “Money printer go brrrrr” meme – I think it reflected a similar “hell-in-a-handbasket” trade to that of gold. Conditions were all-out scary, creating an uber-bearish picture of impending dystopian breakdown, which favored bitcoin as the must-have crypto reserve asset. Now, with liquidity sloshing around the crypto economy (itself a spillover from the Fed’s injections into the fiat currency economy), speculators are looking at surging demand for DeFi credit products and improving sentiment around new blockchain- and smart-contract based projects such as China’s. That’s compelling them to buy ether, the underlying commodity that fuels Ethereum’s smart contract engines.
I’m not wedded to this analysis. Just thought it was fun. Open to critiques of it. Have at me.
WOODEN MONEY.“Yeah. ‘What is economics?'” Fournier laughed. “I’m a firefighter. I’m not an accountant, I’m not a, you know, I guess I’m a mayor, you know?”–CBS News, July 19.
We reported three months ago on the small Italian town ofCastellino del Bifernodeciding to print its own money to restore monetary liquidity after the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a deflationary contraction. Now in Tenino, Washington (population 1,884), Mayor Wayne Fournier is taking similar actions. But in Tenino’s case, it’s cranking up an 1890 printing press that’s producing a throwback: local currency made out of wood.
The idea behind community currencies, which lock spending within the local economy, is not unique to the COVID-19 era. There were alreadymore than one hundred such units of exchangearound the U.S. alone. But desperate times are forcing creativity around money. People like this firefighter mayor and his neighbors are inspired to ponder what money represents and how its design and management have social implications.
SETTLEMENT SUCCESS:One of the challenges for widespread acceptance of blockchain technology lies in taxonomy: how we describe what it is and what it does. These unprecedented new models of value exchange don’t lend themselves to clear analogies, which means people misunderstand them. So, it’s good to see a smart take from Ryan Watkins over at Messari, a research firm, who isasking investors to think differently about what blockchains actually dobefore they jump to conclusions about their success in facilitating payments.
Rather than holding bitcoin to a “you can’t buy a cup of coffee” test, in which its small transaction viability is undermined by volatile BTC exchange rates and high transaction fees, Watkins describes blockchains as the settlement layer to facilitate larger-scale payment flows. A better comparison than cash, he says, is Fedwire, the Federal Reserve’s system that allows banks to settle their balances with each other. Bitcoin and Ethereum are on track to settle a record $1.3 trillion in combined value in 2020, the third consecutive trillion dollar-plus year, a success by any measure. A big chunk of that is driven by surging stablecoin transactions on Ethereum, which should surpass half a trillion dollars in value this year, putting it in striking range of the $712 billion in payments PayPal settled last year. Blockchains do much more than just enable fiat transfers; they offer a whole layer of settlement functionality that’s giving rise to an alternative financial system. Hard to call this a failure.
WHO “OWNS” YOUR TWITTER HANDLE?Anyone who’s gone down the early bitcoin discovery rabbithole of “what is money anyway?” will know that the digital asset age is challenging our notions of value, rights and the law. In that vein, a friendly debate, triggered by last week’s Twitter hack, saw Coin Center Executive Director Jerry Brito line up against Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter. Carter set it off with his thesis, laid out in one of his regularCoinDesk columns,that ownership rights over Twitter accounts should accrue to users, not the company. His anti-deplatformingpoint was that users create most of the value attached to their handles through their posts and interactions, and that this establishes a form of digital property that cannot be taken from them.Brito’s response, invited by Carter, was that the relationship between the user and Twitter lies in a contract that the former signs with the latter in setting up their account. By extension, any discussion about Twitter’s rights to kick someone off their platform hinges on whether the contract is enforceable or not, not on who owns the platform itself.
Whichever argument would win in court, the debate – which was extended by Carter’s“rebuttal to the rebuttal”on (where else but) Twitter – helps frame the discussion about how to design a better social media platform. The bottom line, and both Carter and Brito agree on this, is that centralized social media platforms have done great harm. We are way past due for a model that gives users’ autonomy over their content and data, all attached to a clearly defined concept of self-sovereign, digital identity.
Banks in US Can Now Offer Crypto Custody Services, Regulator SaysBig news for the crypto industry: Banks are now allowed to provide digital asset custody services.

Wyoming-Based Avanti to Open in October With a New Bank-Issued Digital Asset.Wyoming is ahead of the U.S. OCC’s curve. With a state bank charter already in place, Wyoming blockchain advocate Caitlin Long’s Avanti Financial will issue a new digital asset, known as Avit, Nathan DiCamillo reports. Long argues a bank charter is necessary to ensure that digital assets such as stablecoins have all the power of immediate-settlement programmable money – a topic Money Reimagined is a little obsessed with, as indicated by thisshout-out in Long’s explanatory tweet thread.
3 Reasons Bitcoin’s Price Could Soon Rise to $10K.By bitcoin’s volatile standards, it has been a remarkably dull past month. Since June 23, the leading cryptocurrency has traded back and forth within a $600 range, failing to break out either way. Now, maybe, just maybe, we have the chance of a breakout. I like to think the mid-week jump was fueled by the OCC news. But CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports on three other reasons why bitcoin might be poised for a breakout, with the newfound volatility being a reason unto itself. Also: growing institutional investor interest in bitcoin futures and a positive “risk-on” trend in traditional financial markets:
Crypto Needn’t Fear GPT-3. It Should Embrace It.For producers of content and creative output such as journalists, graphic designers and even software coders, the bombshell release of OpenAI’s powerful general language model programming system is a little terrifying. Might the programmed creative take our jobs? And what of the risk that crypto scammers will use it to create fake news to move markets? Forget it, argues our contributor Jesus Rodriguez, who says the groundbreaking AI technology will be more valuable than threatening to the industry. The reason: It can devise powerful quant trading strategies that will bring liquidity and sophistication to crypto’s otherwise volatile, Wild West markets.
Ethereum 2.0 Developers Announce ‘Final’ Testnet Before Network Launch.Maybe, just maybe, the vitally important Ethereum 2.0 release will come by year-end. That’s one interpretation of this important final test run for the massive upgrade’s development schedule. With DeFi and decentralized exchangessending gas fees soaring on the bloated Ethereum blockchain, the moves to boost throughput with “sharding” and to introduce a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus mechanism can’t come soon enough. (Incidentally, on September 29, CoinDesk will host CoinDesk Invest: Eth 2.0, a virtual conference on this very topic and what it means for investors. Details to come.)

21215,2018-03-03 19:01:00,"Better Stock: Square, Inc. (SQ) vs. Mastercard (MA)","Square(NYSE: SQ)estimates that by 2025, worldwide credit and debit card payment volume will reach$45trillionannually. With the world becoming more digital every day -- and with 85% of global transactions still being made in cash -- this colossal market should only continue to grow for decades.
Square andMastercard(NYSE: MA)are two businesses that are poised to profit handsomely from this megatrend. But which is the better buy today?
As the world shifts away from cash and toward digital transactions, Mastercard and Square stand to benefit. Image source: Getty Images.
Let's take a look at some key metrics to see how these payment leaders stack up in regards to financial strength.
[{""Revenue"": ""Operating income"", ""$2.21 billion"": ""($54.21 million)"", ""$12.50 billion"": ""$6.62 billion""}, {""Revenue"": ""Net income"", ""$2.21 billion"": ""($62.81 million)"", ""$12.50 billion"": ""$3.92 billion""}, {""Revenue"": ""Operating cash flow"", ""$2.21 billion"": ""$127.71 million"", ""$12.50 billion"": ""$5.56 billion""}, {""Revenue"": ""Free cash flow"", ""$2.21 billion"": ""$101.61 million"", ""$12.50 billion"": ""$5.13 billion""}, {""Revenue"": ""Cash and investments"", ""$2.21 billion"": ""$866.05 million"", ""$12.50 billion"": ""$7.78 billion""}, {""Revenue"": ""Debt"", ""$2.21 billion"": ""$358.57 million"", ""$12.50 billion"": ""$5.42 billion""}]

Mastercard is a financial titan, with profit and cash flow that dwarf those of Square. And while Square is on solid financial footing with more than $500 million in net cash on its balance sheet, Mastercard's net cash currently checks in at more than $2.3 billion. Thus, this matchup is rather one-sided in regards to financial fortitude, with Mastercard the clear leader.
Advantage: Mastercard
Mastercard may be the more financially sound business at this point in time, but Square is growing much faster.
SQ Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts
Wall Street expects Square to grow its revenue by more than 33% in 2018 and 28% in 2019, while Mastercard's sales are anticipated to rise by about 16% and 12% during that same time. Moreover, analysts estimate that Square will increase its earnings per share at an incredible 87% annually over the next five years. Mastercard, meanwhile, is expected to grow its EPS by about 20% annually over the next half-decade.
With its recent past -- and, more importantly, expected future -- growth exceeding that of its larger rival, Square has the edge here.
Advantage: Square
No better-buy discussion should take place without a look at valuation. Let's now check out some key value metrics for Square and MasterCard, including price-to-sales, price-to-earnings (P/E), and price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratios.
[{""P/S"": ""Trailing P/E"", ""7.93"": ""N/A"", ""14.79"": ""48.17""}, {""P/S"": ""Forward P/E"", ""7.93"": ""60.23"", ""14.79"": ""24.94""}, {""P/S"": ""PEG"", ""7.93"": ""1.20"", ""14.79"": ""1.44""}]
Data source: Yahoo! Finance.
Mastercard's stock is more expensive on a price-to-sales basis, which is to be expected since it's the far more profitable business. On a forward P/E basis, however, Square is the much more expensive stock. But what I find most interesting is that Square's PEG ratio -- which factors in its significantly higher expected EPS growth rate -- is considerably lower than that of Mastercard. And so, rather surprisingly, I'm going to give Square the edge in terms of current valuation.
Advantage: Square
Mastercard and Square are both great options if you're looking for a way to profit from the surging growth of electronic payments. But with its stronger growth prospects and more attractively valued stock, Square is the better buy today.

8256,2019-01-18 19:15:40,This Bitcoin Startup Is Working on Free Speech Alternatives to Patreon,"Patreon has been making the case for censorship-resistant money increasingly apparent.
The platform allows members to contribute to artists or creators that they support. These contributions are made via standard payment methods like credit cards.
Over the past few months, there has been an increase in public outcry over multiple separate instances where Patreon has removed creators from its platform. BitPatron, a Bitcoin-friendly version of the website, has recently come to the surface as a possible alternative.
One of the first well-known bans dates back to August 2018 when James Allsup, a far-right political commentator, was banned from the funding platform.
In December, a wave of media attention ensued when another alt-right activist and spokesperson, Milo Yiannopoulos, was shut down almost 24 hours after he had set up an account to fund his “magnificent 2019 comeback tour.” Patreon’sreasoningforremovingYiannopoulos’s account was due to his past association with the Proud Boys, a violent, far-right political group (whose founders werekicked off of Facebook and Twitterrecently as well).
Only a day after Yiannopoulos’s ban, British YouTuber Sargon of Akkad had his account removed forviolating Patreon’s hate speech guidelinesby making racist and hateful remarks toward minority groups.
Another notable example occurred when Patreon had to close an account against their will when Mastercard required them to remove the account of Robert Spencer, a political activist and author of several “counter-Jihad” books.
In response to Spencer’s removal and other account bans, Jordan Peterson, professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, and David Rubin, creator and host ofThe Rubin Report,announcedthey were leaving Patreon because of the way that the platform has handled these situations.
Bitcoin is a censorship-resistant currency. One of its many valuable attributes is that nobody can tellanyonewhat they can or cannot do with their bitcoin. As long as someone is able to receive bitcoin (which, by design, is very easy to do), no transaction from anywhere can be stopped.
BitPatronis a direct response to Patreon’s proclivity to censor content on the platform. It will offer a similar crowdfunding platform as its predecessor, but will allow users to support creators with bitcoin.
By using Bitcoin and Lightning as payment methods, BitPatron expects to offer lower fees than its competitor. BitPatron’s payment processing system is built on top of BTCPayServer, an open-source payment processor for Bitcoin and Lightning. According to the website, there is no minimum pledge amount, compared to Patreon’s $1 minimum. Total fees for the platform are 4 percent, much lower than Patreon’s 10 percent.
The platform’s co-founder believes that, more than just offering users a lower fee competitor to Patreon, BitPatron’s focus on bitcoin is about free speech.
“Patreon publicly admitted that Mastercard required them to remove accounts. This is where Bitcoin and BitPatron come in. Bitcoin is censorship-resistant, free-speech money, and BitPatron is taking a leading role at building a Bitcoin-based, censorship-resistant platform that gives the power back to the community where it belongs,” Vin, co-founder of BitPatron, toldBitcoin Magazine.
But BitPatron is still not a completely, “anything goes” platform yet. A spokesperson for the company toldBitcoin Magazine:“For now, we are planning to monitor and block only in extreme cases, such as illegal pornography, threats or calls for violence, or terrorism-related content.
He added that ideally, in its purest form there would be no centralized control, but there’d be some sort of decentralized algorithm to perform the necessary checks. “That's why we are considering blockchain platforms that would allow users to self-host their content and be responsible for it.
“We want to remain a platform for every voice, which is, in our opinion, a far greater task than monitoring ‘hate speech.’ We therefore need to make sure that the platform remains interesting for voices of the entire spectrum.”
BitPatron will first allow podcasters and video creators to offer exclusive content to their supporters, and it also has plans integrate with Discord groups to support chat rooms.
In the bigger picture, a platform like BitPatron could support content creators from all walks of media. It is a platform where people receive financial support from others all across the world in a seamless and instant way with a censorship-resistant currency.
According to the platform, the public beta will go live next month.

""The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence,"" four researchers wrote in the latest edition of the regional Fed bank's Economic Letter.
Fed policymakers have been dismissive, particularly in recent months, of bitcoin's promise as an alternative currency to the dollar or other central bank-backed money. San Francisco Fed President John Williams, who will next month move to New York to run the Fed there, has been particularly critical.
""One of the problems they have is the values are extremely volatile,"" Williams said in April of cryptocurrencies in general and bitcoin in particular.
Trading in futures, which sometimes reduces volatility in the underlying asset, appeared this time to aid bitcoin's fall.
The introduction of the contracts on CME, one week after a much thinner trade on began rival Chicago Board Options Exchange, gave bitcoin pessimists an easy way to bet on a drop in value. This is known as short-selling in the stock market but is an integral and unremarkable aspect of futures markets.
As trade in downside bets picked up on CME, the authors of the Fed paper wrote, that created a broader downcycle that affected the underlying ""spot"" bitcoin market as well, reducing order flow and putting downward pressure on the price.
""With falling prices, pessimists started to make money on their bets, fueling further short selling and further downward pressure on prices,"" they wrote. (Reporting by Ann Saphir Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)",9359.99,0.01,9364.89,0.06,9378.5,0.21,9362.47,0.04,9358.99

1271,2017-06-06 21:14:42,AMD rallies as cryptocurrency miners snap up graphics chips,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Advanced Micro Devices surged nearly 9 percent on Tuesday boosted by strong demand for its chips from cryptocurrency miners, leaving short sellers at a loss for the year.
A rally in cryptocurrency Ethereum has boosted demand for graphics chips used by people to ""mine"" it and other digital currencies, with some of AMD's processors sold out on Amazon.com and other retail websites.
Mining for cryptocurrency involves using networks of computers to validate transactions and prevent counterfeit by solving complex mathematical problems. New currency is generated as a reward to the computer operators.
The emergence of Bitcoin in 2009 made cryptocurrency mining popular. Recent rallies in the price of Bitcoin and newer digital currency Ethereum have rekindled interest.
Ethereum miners spending as little as $2,000 to build mining computers using graphics processing units, or GPUs, from AMD or its rival Nvidia could break even within three or four months, estimated RBC analyst Mitch Steves in a note to clients on Tuesday.
""We think economics suggests that GPUs continue to be sold out,"" Steves wrote. ""We think GPU demand will remain robust as long as the return is under (about) one year.""
As of Monday, AMD short sellers had been up about $15 million for 2017. But Tuesday’s share surge left them at a loss of $125 million on paper for the year, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.
That follows losses of over $700 million for AMD short sellers last year, when the stock tripled.
The stock last traded up 7.3 percent at $12.06.
""There are going to be a lot of traders saying, 'This is the last straw. I'm out,'"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3's managing director of research.
AMD spokesman Drew Prairie acknowledged that interest from cryptocurrency miners was contributing to demand for the company's chips, but he stressed that game enthusiasts are the core market.
JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft Corp, Intel Corp and more than two dozen other companies have teamed up to develop standards to make it easier for enterprises to use technology related to Ethereum.
Adding to support for AMD's stock, Apple on Monday refreshed its lineup of Mac personal computers, including upgraded graphics chips from AMD.",,,,,,,,,

63878,2023-05-11 14:17:30,Tether’s balance sheet is still a black hole,"One of the enduring mysteries in crypto is how Tether, an offshore firm with a long history of dodgy business and accounting practices, has held its role as one of the most important pillars of the industry. Skeptics have for years predicted the stablecoin giant, whose $82 billion market cap is thethird biggestin crypto, would collapse—yet Tether continues to grow bigger and more influential.

On Wednesday, the firm sought to show that its finances are in order byreleasingan ""assurance report"" that purports to show it is not only solvent but in better shape than ever. The document, prepared by an outfit called BDO Italia, shows Tether has assets that exceed its liabilities by more than $2 billion and it is now holding sizable chunks of gold and Bitcoin.
On its face, this sounds like great news for the crypto industry, large segments of which rely on the stablecoin as a nonvolatile place to park their wealth. But since this is Tether we're talking about, the new report also points to ongoing dodginess. For starters, why is a company nominally worth $80 billion issuing an ""assurance report"" rather than, you know, an actual corporate audit? And why is it using an off-brand shop in Italy rather than a blue-chip accounting and consulting firm?
That's far from the only odd thing going on. John Reed Stark, a consultant who formally ran the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division, posted a withering series ofremarksabout the report on Twitter. These include questions about why Tether tapped its CTO to attest to the company's finances rather than a CFO, and why it eschews a raft of other basic compliance measures.
Then there is the issue of Tether holding gold and Bitcoin as part of its reserves, which are supposed to ensure that each of its digital tokens is backed by the equivalent in U.S. dollars. These gold and Bitcoin holdings performed fantastically during Q1, a period during which each asset climbed by double digits, and presumably helped Tether achieve what it calls an ""excellent quarter."" But what happens if the market takes a nosedive and Tether has to mark down all that gold and Bitcoin? Couldn't that lead to a situation where all those Tether tokens are not backed 1-to-1 by dollars?
In the traditional financial world, all these irregularities would raise alarm among traders who would start dumping their holdings in favor of something safer. But this is crypto, and as Bloomberg's Matt Levine has noted, the rules are different and so people seem content to just accept Tether's viability whether or not its accounting practices add up. I confess I've tried to make sense of Tether for years and can't come up with a compelling reason to trust it—other than to note the company has been around for almost a decade now and keeps chugging along even as major U.S. banks implode left and right. If anyone can explain this to me, I'm all ears.

Itstruggled in 2016 and 2017, with its midstream business hemorrhaging cash and its prized propane business sidelined by unusually warm winter weather. It may have encountered an existential crisis if forced to endure similar headwinds in 2018. But the recent arctic blast promises to deliver a shot of adrenaline into the company's turnaround campaign.
Does the near certainty of a solid performance in the current quarter make Ferrellgas Partners a buy in 2018?
Image source: Getty Images.
You probably don't need any reminders of how cold it's been lately, butlaws were suspendedin some states so propane trucks could make deliveries in recent weeks. That's how cold it was. Making matters worse, Uncle Sam's run-in with sub-zero weather occurredafterpropane prices began creeping up and national inventory falling. Expect both trends to have worsened after the cold spells are reflected in the data.
Residential propane prices were 11% higher on the first day of 2018 compared to one year ago according todata from the EIA. Wholesale prices were 30% higher, and the nation's inventory 19% lower in the same comparison periods.
When it comes to distributing propane, volumes, not prices, are king. That's because propane prices are usually relatively stable, even during cold winter months, since companies purchase their stocks during the summer months. That said, Ferrellgas Partners should achieve one its best winters in several years in terms of both volume and prices when it releases fiscal second-quarter 2018 (the period from the first day of November to the end of January) results sometime in April.
The strong start to the year for propane is exactly what the company needed, but it's likely not enough on its own to erase two years of misery. Luckily, the midstream business could be on the cusp of riding a wave of momentum.
Image source: Getty Images.
One of the leading reasons Ferrellgas Partners decided to jump into midstream operations was the fact that crude oil transportation was relatively insulated from seasonality, unlike the propane business. Whether it's January or June, major oil-producing regions are still pumping dinosaur sauce out of the ground, and the company would be there to haul it to its next destination.
While that's all true, collapsing crude oil prices and the loss of a key customer made the logistics business a lot more difficult. But with energy prices at multi-year highs and American crude oil production expected to hit record highs this year, that could change in 2018.
The company showed some minor signs of improvement during itsfiscal first-quarter 2018(the period up to the end of October 2017). The midstream segment posted a 12% bump in revenue compared to the year-ago period, thanks to an 8% year-over-year increase in short haul delivery volumes. By focusing on higher value routes, Ferrellgas Partners improved the gross profit in its crude oil and other logistics sub-segment from just 34% in the first quarter of 2017 to 63% in the most recent quarter. Not bad.
The midstream business could improve significantly in the months and year ahead on crude oil prices' near-term highs, matching levels last seen in 2015. Ironically, that was also the last time the company seemed to have its head firmly above water.
I have to admit that Ferrellgas Partners' prospects became much rosier in the last month after I last wrote about it. Nonetheless, the prior CEO dug a pretty big hole -- and he was digging for over two years. That won't be rectified in a single quarter, not even if fiscal second-quarter 2018 delivers surprisingly good results, although it could hint that the propane leader is finally regaining its footing.
Given that, I would still sit on the sidelines with this stock. The next update from management will be key to gauging how Ferrellgas Partners will fare in 2018 and just how much more work is needed to reach its balance sheet and cash flow goals.

32991,2021-10-22 11:19:52,Eyeball scans in return for free crypto coins,"A cryptocurrency company wants to scan the eyeballs of billions of people in exchange for digital coins.
Worldcoin said it has already registered iris-scans of 130,000 people, using a device called the “Orb” it has developed, and is hoping to ramp up to hit a billion people within two years.
The cryptocurrency start-up is aiming to use the scans as a form of verification to dish out a supply of 10 billion cryptocurrency tokens. The iris scans would be used to prevent people receiving multiple payouts.
The bizarre project has received $25m from investors, including early Facebook backer Andreessen Horowitz, and is valued at $1bn.
Sam Altman, the American technology investor and entrepreneur behind the project, has suggested its tokens could form the basis of a new cryptocurrency-based economy, or of a form of universal basic income.
In a blog post, Mr Altman and Alex Blania, chief executive, said: “To get its new currency into the hands of as many people as possible, Worldcoin will allow everyone to claim a free share.
“For this to happen, we first had to solve one major challenge: ensuring that every person on Earth can prove they are indeed human (not a bot) and that they have not received their free share of Worldcoin already.”
The founders admitted the outlandish project could fail to take off. “Nothing like this has ever been done before and the outcome is uncertain,” they said.
The eye scans will be turned into a line of code, and no image will be stored or recorded, the company said. Worldcoin said it would begin signing up users using its Orb in five countries initially, before deploying Orbs globally to attract users.
The Orb weighs 2.5kg, is 20 centimetres in diameter, and will be given to entrepreneurs who will try to sign up as many users as possible, in exchange for being paid in Worldcoins.
The cryptocurrency linked to the project has yet to be released, but is not expected before 2022. The project runs the risk of confusion with another cryptocurrency effort, also called Worldcoin.
The launch comes as Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, reached a new record price this week of around $66,000. Analysts have said investors are looking to the digital coin as a hedge against inflation.",63432.97,0.03,63395.28,-0.03,63307.85,-0.17,63316.0,-0.16,63417.01

In recent weeks,Mullen Automotive(NASDAQ:MULN) shares have found support. No longer in freefall, MULN stock has seemingly found a floor at around $1 per share. Investors reacted favorably to the aspiringelectric vehicle(EV) maker’s May 13 press release, in which it touted positive news such as an increased cash position.
What hasn’t received much fanfare has been the company’s actual quarterly financial filing. Released on May 17, it paints a much less rosy picture of Mullen’s current financial status. Quickly burning through cash, there’s a high likelihood it will need to raise significant capital in the coming months.
Like its past financing deals, this will likely be done on terms unfavorable to existing investors. At around $1 per share and down more than 90% over the past year, it may seem as if it has little more room to drop, but think again. Investors bottom-fishing today could still see big losses.
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
[]
Mullen Automotive touted many positives in its May 13 press release. For example, the fledgling EV maker highlighted that it increased its cash position by$65.2 millionduring the quarter. It also reduced its debt position, and that shareholder equity swung from negative to positive.
Also, Mullen entered a deal withThurner Designto develop a high-performance EV sport crossover, the Mullen Five RS. While it’s not enough to get MULN stock “to the moon” again, this news was enough to get the stock over the $1 per share mark. Since then, it’s managed to hold steady at or around this price level.
This is despite both market volatility and the May 17 10-Q release. Mullen hyped up the good in its press release, but buried the bad in the filing. For the quarter ending March 31, it reported an operating loss of$30.4 millionand negative operating cash flow of $24.9 million.
Adding in capital expenditures, cash burn came in at around $36.6 million. Assuming its cash burn will rise as it moves further towards the production stage, today’s $65.1 million cash position will not last long.
In my last article on MULN stock, the crux of my argument was the company’s need toraise more capitalwould severely dilute shareholders. Through the issuance of more shares and a likely reverse stock split, it would continue to tumble in price — even as shares traded deep in penny stock territory.
Put simply, the numbers provided in the 10-Q confirm this concern. Any way you slice it, a company with $65.2 million in cash that’s burning through $36.6 million of it (or more) per quarter is going to need more money.
Assuming it has to continue raising this money through convertible financing, as it’s done before, it’ll do so on terms highly unfavorable to anyone holding MULN stock. Between the fading of excitement over the May 13 press release, plus the issuance of more shares, Mullen will likely fall below its current level.
In theory, this could provide it with another floor. Investors erroneously believing its sub-$1 stock price makes it “cheap” could soften the blow. However, there’s another factor to consider.
Dilution will set a further drop in motion, but something else will really drive it: a reverse stock split. If it falls below $1 per share for a significant amount of time, it’ll likely reverse split to keep itsNasdaqlisting.
Bringing its share price out of penny stock levels, the short-side will return. They’ll hammer it lower once again. On a split-adjusted basis, this would result in a big decline relative to today’s stock price.
Coupled with this high downside risk is questionable upside. As myInvestorPlacecolleague Josh Enomoto argued earlier this month, it’s hard to believe this undercapitalized upstart will beat outestablished rivalsby bringing out a better line of EVs.
In short, don’t view its May 13 press release as a sign the story’s changed with MULN stock. It hasn’t.

By Richard Leong and Catherine Ngai
NEW YORK, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Financial products that bet on swings in equities and cryptocurrencies should be monitored to understand their risk to market stability, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley said on Wednesday.
The comments came after BlackRock Inc, the world's biggest asset manager, urged more regulation of the so-called inverse volatility-linked products that were hammered during a stock meltdown that wiped out $4 trillion in market value worldwide on Monday.
""The thing we worry about when we look at the financial system and worry about financial stability risk are: where are places where there are feedback loops?"" Dudley said when asked about volatility-linked products and bitcoin futures at an event on banking culture co-sponsored by Reuters and the European American Chamber of Commerce.
Dudley cited the 1987 stock market crash, in which a product called portfolio insurance was blamed for causing a negative feedback loop that intensified a worldwide equities selloff.
Investors using exchange-traded products to bet on the VIX , Wall Street's so-called fear gauge which measures expectations for near-term S&P 500 swings, were pummeled on Monday when the index posted its biggest single-day rise ever.
Meanwhile, global regulatory clampdown and moves by banks to ban purchases of bitcoin with credit cards have roiled digital currency prices. Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, on Tuesday fell to a three-month low under $6,000 before rebounding to $8,119 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange .
Such financial products offer ways for investors to hedge risk, he said. ""But you have to make sure they’re appropriate and well designed.""
""With the stock market having a bit of a bumpy ride over the last days, there’s a question as volatility goes up, will that cause people to sell stocks,"" Dudley said. ""If that were the case, that could cause the stock market to be bumpy in the future.""
With the rebound in financial markets since Monday, Dudley said he has not changed his view about steady U.S. economic growth.
""My outlook hasn’t changed because the stock market is a bit lower than where it was a few days ago. It’s still up sharply than a year (ago),"" he said.
Dudley had been chief economist at Goldman Sachs for a decade before being appointed to head the New York Fed in 2007. He announced in November he would step down from his Fed position in mid-2018.
The VIX index ended down over 7 percent at 27.73, almost 50 percent lower than its highest level since August 2015 reached on Tuesday.
WELL FARGO'S CULTURE
While Dudley gave his thoughts about this week's market volatility, he spoke mainly about banking culture on a panel where he and others said progress has been made since the global credit crisis but more could be done to bolster investor and consumer confidence and bank employee morale.
Bad incentive structures for employees and a lack of communication to management contributed to Wells Fargo & Co's sales practices scandal, Dudley said.
Dudley said that Wells Fargo employees were given ""really bad"" incentives. He added that when employees complained, it went up the chain of command but concerns either were not heard or ignored.
The bank reached a $190 million settlement with U.S. authorities in 2016 over its employees opening accounts in customers' names without their permission to hit sales targets.
On Friday, Wells Fargo detailed new regulatory restrictions imposed by the Fed, including a cap on its assets until it improves its governance and controls.
Dudley said he is generally pleased with the ""substantial progress"" among banks to improve company culture and conduct, but that there is more room to grow.

In 2023, TIME will once again recognize 100 businesses making an extraordinary impact around the world. Applications for theTIME100 Most Influential Companies of 2023are open, now through March 1, 2023.Apply here.
(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world’s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, clickhere.)
Somehow, Mira Murati can forthrightly discuss the dangers of AI while making you feel like it’s all going to be OK.
Murati is chief technology officer at OpenAI, leading the teams behind DALL-E, which uses AI to create artwork based on prompts, and ChatGPT, the wildly popular AI chatbot that can answer complex questions with eerily humanlike skill.
ChatGPT captured the public imagination upon its release in late November. While some schools are banning it, Microsoft announced a $10 billion investment in the company and Google issued a “code red,” fretting that the technology could disrupt its search business. “As with other revolutions that we’ve gone through, there will be new jobs and some jobs will be lost…” Murati told Trevor Noah last fall of the impact of AI, “but I’m optimistic.”
For most of January,ChatGPTsurpassedBitcoinamong popular search terms, according to Google Trends. All the attention has meant the privately held San Francisco–based startup—with 375 employees and little in the way of revenue—now has a valuation of roughly $30 billion. Murati spoke to TIME about ChatGPT’s biggest weakness, the software’s untapped potential, and why it’s time to move toward regulating AI.
We weren’t anticipating this level of excitement from putting our child in the world. We, in fact, even had some trepidation about putting it out there. I’m curious to see the areas where it’ll start generating utility for people and not just novelty and pure curiosity.
That is a good question. ChatGPT is essentially a large conversational model—a big neural net that’s been trained to predict the next word—and the challenges with it are similar challenges we see with the base large language models: it may make up facts.
Yes. This is actually a core challenge. We picked dialogue specifically because dialogue is a way to interact with a model and give it feedback. If we think that the answer of the model is incorrect, we can say, “Are you sure? I think actually…” And then the model has an opportunity to go back and forth with you, similar to how we would converse with another human.

Right now, it’s in the research review stage, so I don’t want to speak with high confidence on what problems it is solving. But I think that we can see that it has the potential to really revolutionize the way we learn. People are in classrooms of, say, 30 people. Everyone has different backgrounds, ways of learning, and everyone is getting basically the same curriculum. With tools like ChatGPT, you can endlessly converse with a model to understand a concept in a way that is catered to your level of understanding. It has immense potential to help us with personalized education.
When we’re developing these technologies, we’re really pushing toward general intelligence, general capabilities with high reliability—and doing so safely. But when you open it up to as many people as possible with different backgrounds and domain expertise, you’ll definitely get surprised by the kinds of things that they do with the technology, both on the positive front and on the negative front.
This is a unique moment in time where we do have agency in how it shapes society. And it goes both ways: the technology shapes us and we shape it. There are a lot of hard problems to figure out. How do you get the model to do the thing that you want it to do, and how you make sure it’s aligned with human intention and ultimately in service of humanity? There are also a ton of questions around societal impact, and there are a lot of ethical and philosophical questions that we need to consider. And it’s important that we bring in different voices, like philosophers, social scientists, artists, and people from the humanities.
[AI] can be misused, or it can be used by bad actors. So, then there are questions about how you govern the use of this technology globally. How do you govern the use of AI in a way that’s aligned with human values?
It’s important for OpenAI and companies like ours to bring this into the public consciousness in a way that’s controlled and responsible. But we’re a small group of people and we need a ton more input in this system and a lot more input that goes beyond the technologies-—definitely regulators and governments and everyone else.
It’s not too early. It’s very important for everyone to start getting involved, given the impact these technologies are going to have.

40454,2018-07-16 15:52:40,"Much Wow, Very Trade: Dogecoin is Now Listed on Robinhood Crypto","Stock trading app Robinhood has listed dogecoin on its commission-free cryptocurrency trading platform, the company announced on Monday.
Theparody cryptocurrency, created in 2013, currently ranks as the 44th-largest cryptocurrency, with a circulating market cap of $288 million. At its peak in early January, dogecoin’s market cap swelled as high as $2.1 billion, much to thechagrinof creator Jackson Palmer, who is no longer officially involved with the project.
Dogecoin’s listing brings the total number of cryptocurrencies available on Robinhood to five. Last week, the brokerage app — which is better-known for its equities offerings —added support for bitcoin cash and litecoin, the first coins the firm had added since it launched earlier this year with bitcoin and ethereum trading. Users can currently add 11 other cryptoassets to their watchlist.
Robinhood Crypto is currently available in just 17 states, due to a patchwork of state-level regulations governing cryptocurrency trading. The firm is said to beengaging in discussionswith regulators about applying for a national banking charter, which — among other things — would preempt local laws. For now, the firm is rolling out support for the feature on a state-by-state basis.
The company has also said that it plans to support cryptocurrency deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, likely indicating that it is building a full-fledged cryptocurrency wallet.
Notably, the announcement does not appear to have had a noticeable effect on the dogecoin price. DOGE/USD is up nearly five percent on Monday over its previous-day level, but DOGE/BTC has traded sideways, meaning that the coin’s USD appreciation is likely tied to areportthat BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has begun exploring investments in the cryptocurrency sector.
That stands in marked contrast to what happened on Friday, when five altcoins experiencedmassive price increaseson the mere news cryptocurrency exchange and brokerage giant was “exploring” adding them to its stable of assets in the future, pending discussions with regulators and banking partners.
Robinhood, which now has more than 5 million users, recently raised $363 million at a $5.6 billion valuation. Company executives have said that they intend to operate the nascent cryptocurrency trading service as a break-even venture for the foreseeable future.

The round was backed by Polychain, Hypersphere, Bithumb Global and Divergence Ventures, according to a blogpostshared with CoinDesk. Clover isn’t alone; it joins Substrate-based projectSnowforkand coding houseChainSafein producing cross-chain bridges from Ethereum to Polkadot.
“Clover aims to become the very first noncustodial bridge in the space,” Clover project lead Burak Keçeli said in a Telegram message to CoinDesk.

Clover’s tech backend is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a necessary step for applications like decentralized finance (DeFi) apps to work on Clover. The startup has redesigned Clover’s payment scheme to increase ease of use for ordinary consumers as well. For example, Clover has a dynamic fee schedule that increases costs proportionally to use.
The team’s work on a “two-way” peg to the Bitcoin network is still in its infancy. The proof-of-concept depends on the successful implementation of theSchnorr/TaprootandTapscriptbitcoin improvement proposals (BIPs). Those BIPs are currently being vetted by the wider Bitcoin community.
The peg, in theory, would allow value to move between EVM-styled chains like Ethereum and Clover and the largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin.
“We believe Clover’s timing for launch gives it a unique edge to leverage upcoming Bitcoin protocol upgrades to facilitate two-way pegs between Bitcoin and Ethereum,” Polychain general partner Tekin Salimi said in a Telegram message to CoinDesk. “One of the challenges prior Bitcoin-Ethereum bridge attempts faced was in Bitcoin’s limited scripting language. We think the Bitcoin/Ethereum bridge is the most interesting feature, as it’s unique to Clover.”

52126,2021-11-10 04:53:04,Day 7 of Kleiman v. Wright: Wright Tells Jury Kleiman Only Mined ‘Testnet’ Bitcoins,"MIAMI— Craig Wright – best known for his long-standing andwidely disputedclaims to beSatoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin – told a Miami jury on Tuesday that at least a portion of the 1.1 millionbitcointhe plaintiffs’ attorneys are calling “Satoshi’s hoard” were purchased, not mined.
“I purchased them from a Russian exchange,” the Australian computer scientist stated. “They were dodgy, I know, but everyone was dodgy in 2011.”
The Tulip Trust was a mysterious and perhaps, as some sleuths havespeculated, non-existent offshore trust account the plaintiffs believe Wright has used to hide bitcoins. Wright told the jury the trust was created in 2011 to shelter his assets from an investigation by the Australian Tax Office (ATO). Wright said he signed over the assets in the trust, including over a million bitcoins, to Dave Kleiman, his best friend and alleged business partner who died in 2013, to protect himself from bankruptcy.
Wright added that the approximately 1.1 million bitcoins he claims to have purchased in 2011 have since been “spent” on Wright’s companies.
The plaintiffs – Dave’s brother Ira Kleiman and W&K Info Defense Research LLC, a company Ira claims Wright and Dave owned jointly to mine and “invent” bitcoin – are seeking what they claim to be Dave’s share of the bitcoins and intellectual property from their joint business venture. They haveaccused Wrightof stealing from Dave’s estate through a complex web of legal maneuvers, shell companies and forgeries.

Wright, for his part, maintains that he and Dave never mined or “created” bitcoin together, despite a slew of emails, chat messages and legal documents presented by the plaintiffs in which Wright tells numerous people, including Dave’s friends and family and the Australian authorities, that he and Dave had a joint mining operation.
Instead, Wright testified in court that any emails saying he and Dave mined bitcoins together were either fraudulent (Wright has long maintained that he is the victim of numerous hacks) or taken out of context.
The defense has also leaned heavily on its allegation that Wright’s autism explains both his combative demeanor and his contradictory statements. In her deposition testimony read on Monday, Wright’s wife, Ramona Watts, said the couple used to “fight every day” over misunderstandings caused by Wright’s autism.
“He is literal beyond anything,” Watts said.
Wright told the jury on Monday that at least some of the bitcoins the plaintiff considers to be part of the “Satoshi stash” owed to Dave’s estate weren’t actually bitcoins at all but “testnet bitcoins” used to test a “supercomputer” that he and Dave were purportedly developing in 2011 and 2012. A testnet is an experimental environment for software under development; coins on such a network typically cannot be transferred to a live, or mainnet, version of a blockchain and so have little if any value.
Bitcoin expert Andreas Antonopoulos, who testified last week as an expert witness for the plaintiffs, told the jury that mining bitcoin could be done with an old-fashioned office computer – which he described as a “beige tower”– until 2013.
Wright also claimed that his emails to Dave’s brother Ira, his father Louis, and his friends and business partners Patrick Paige and Carter Conrad telling them that he and Dave worked together to “create” bitcoin were purposely exaggerated to give his deceased friend a legacy in the minds of his loved ones.
“I exaggerated because Dave had no one remembering him, and he was the most important person in my life for many years,” Wright tearfully told the jury, in one of his several openly emotional moments on the stand.
Read more:In Craig Wright Trial, Plaintiffs Lay Out Pattern of Fraud, Deceit and Hubris
Wright told the jury that he did mine approximately a million bitcoins on his own, however, as “Satoshi,” (Wright told the jury he mined blocks 1 through 16) and as himself after retiring the Satoshi accounts at the end of 2010.
Wright alleges that he alone mined approximately 1 million bitcoins, that Dave independently mined approximately 1 million testnet bitcoins, and that Wright purchased 1.1 million bitcoins for the supposed Tulip Trust – the similarity in the numbers is, according to Wright, a coincidence, and the plaintiff’s attorneys are “conflating” separate batches of coins.
It is important to note that, thus far, neither side has called in an expert in blockchain forensic analysis to trace the origin and movements of any of the coins in question or to give testimony on the possible ownership of any of the wallets that hold (or held) those bitcoins.
Wright’s testimony will continue on Wednesday before the court breaks until Monday morning.",66672.78,0.02,66641.17,-0.03,66405.75,-0.38,66445.36,-0.32,66660.99

Bond yields rose after the BOJ decision, offering negative cues to risk assets, including bitcoin. BOJ's YCC has been a major source of liquidity for global markets since 2016. The move away from the liquidity-boosting policy may have global repercussions. Bitcoin (BTC) held above $29,000 early Friday, while Japanese and U.S. government bond yields rose after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained low-interest rates, but announced a slight hawkish tweak to its liquidity-boosting bond-buying program called yield curve control (YCC). The central bank retained the short-term interest rate target at 0.1% and the YCC's 10-year government bond yield target around 0%. It also maintained its December 2022 decision to allow the 10-year yield to move 0.5% up and down each around the 0% target. The bank, however, said that the 0.5% band would be a reference and not a hard cap, promising more flexibility in the yield curve control. ""The BOJ retained the language around 0.5% target for 10Y JGB, but moved the hard cap to 1%, with a vague language on ""flexibility."" I think this is basically a proper YCC tweak, with semantics designed to make people think it's not as hawkish as it is,"" rates strategist Rishi Mishra tweeted .

Story continues Several investment banks had anticipated a band widening to 100 basis points from 50 bps, with Goldman Sachs saying it might send out a wrong signal to the market. Bitcoin did not see big moves following the BOJ decision and continued to trade sideways, around $29,250. However, bond yields rose, offering negative cues to risk assets, including bitcoin. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield rose six basis points to 0.56%, reaching the highest since January.

The CAR, which has a population of 4.83 million, approved BTC as legal tender alongside the existing CFA franc. President Faustin Archange Touadera said in a statement that lawmakers at the National Assembley had unanimously passed a bill, which he signed into law. The presidents office said it would put the CAR on the map of the worlds boldest and most visionary countries. Gourna Zacko, minister of the digital economy, added: With cryptocurrency , there is no more control of the Central Bank. You have your money, you send an investor for a business, you receive it in any currency, you can dispose with it in dollar, euro, CFA or Naira. The move comes less than a year after El Salvador became the first country in the world to introduce bitcoin as a legal form of tender, allowing citizens to pay for goods, services and taxes. Several other countries have been watching the Central American country closely to see whether bitcoin can bring about economic benefits, such as avoiding hyper inflation and reducing the reliance on the US dollar as the global reserve currency. The Central African Republic will likely face more challenges than El Salvador in rolling out bitcoin adoption, with less than 20 per cent of the population having access to the internet, according to figures from the World Bank. An internet connection is required to spend and receive bitcoin, typically through an app on a smartphone or tablet.

37207,2018-06-21 18:14:55,Ripple CEO: 3 reasons XRP token is not a security,"One week ago, SEC official Bill Hinman declared on stage at Yahoo Finance’sAll Markets Summit: Cryptothat theSEC does not view bitcoin or ether as securities, and thus will leave them alone in terms of SEC regulation.
Hinman did not mentionXRP, the No. 3 cryptocurrency by market cap.
Now Ripple CEOBrad Garlinghouseis making his case for why XRP should get the same treatment as bitcoin and ether. Speaking on Thursday at the CB Insights Future of Fintech conference in New York City,live-streamed by Yahoo Finance, Garlinghouse presented “three key arguments” for why XRP is not a security.
As a quick refresher: Ripple is a private software company that sells products to banks and remittance firms that help them send and settle cross-border payments faster. XRP is a digital token that Ripple, the company, uses in one of its products for banks, xRapid, but does not use in its most popular product, xCurrent.Ripple and XRP are separate things, but they are constantly confused and conflated by cryptocurrency speculators and by the media—it doesn’t help matters that Ripple owns 60% of the supply of XRP tokens.
Here are Garlinghouse’s three arguments.
1. “If Ripple the company shut down tomorrow, the XRP ledger would continue to operate. It’s open-source, decentralized technology that exists independent of Ripple.”
2. “The people buying XRP, they don’t think they’re buying shares of Ripple. There’s a company called Ripple, we are a private company, we have investors… but buying XRP doesn’t give you ownership of Ripple, it doesn’t give you access to dividends or profits that come from Ripple.”
3. “XRP is solving a problem. There’s no utility in a security.”
To be sure, Garlinghouse’s arguments have to come with a heavy grain of salt. He’s making the case for XRP not being a security because Ripple doesn’t want the SEC interfering with XRP. (By the way, if the SEC were to come out and say XRP is not a security, the price of XRP would shoot up.) Cory Johnson, Ripple’s chief market strategist,made the same argument about XRPatYahoo Finance’s crypto summitlast week.
When Garlinghouse says XRP is a utility, he means that it’s used for an actual business purpose, unlike a stock certificate. Ripple utilizes XRP as a vehicle for sending funds internationally. But he ought to go back and look at what the SEC specifically warned in December: “Merely calling a token a ‘utility’ token or structuring it to provide some utility does not prevent the token from being a security.”
Most importantly, many crypto enthusiasts insist that because Ripple owns more than half the supply of XRP, the token is not truly decentralized.
Therein lies the pivotal issue. Hinman of the SEC,in his comments about bitcoin and ether not being securities, focused on the idea that Bitcoin and Ethereum have no central power. They are truly decentralized systems. On the other hand, Hinman said, “There will continue to be systems that rely on central actors whose efforts are a key to the success of the enterprise.”
At the CB Insights conference, moderator Jeff Roberts of Fortune read Hinman’s quote to Garlinghouse and asked, “Doesn’t that sound a lot like Ripple and XRP?” Garlinghouse (unsurprisingly) said no. Instead, he argued, “I think that sounds a lot likethe ICO market,” where companies hold sales of newly created tokens for later use in an ecosystem that usually has not launched yet, and might never launch.
“I don’t think that our ownership of XRP gives us control… just because we own a lot of an asset,” he said. Many would disagree. And if Ripple were to unload a huge chunk of its XRP holdings, it would certainly move the XRP market.
Garlinghouse added, “I look forward to the SEC clarifying some of these things.”

Let’s take a minute to get ahead of what you should be watching and a few potential market movers. First, in terms of economic data, we have the FOMC meeting announcement Wednesday. The Fed is expected to provide a forecast update and leave rates unchanged. We also have Retail Sales, Housing Permits and Starts, and Jobless Claims throughout the week; Friday is Quadruple Witching, so we could see some volatility into the end of the week.
As far as companies reporting quarterly results, keep an eye onNike Inc(NYSE:NKE),FedEx Corporation(NYSE:FDX),Dollar General Corp.(NYSE:DG), andLennar Corporation(NYSE:LEN). Investors and traders will also be dialed in on rates on the rise here in the U.S. The question on the minds of many is, will rates inching higher derail some of the existing trends that have been present with rates at historic lows? Bitcoin to new record highs and above 60K is something to keep an eye on; many are equating it to rates to the upside.
Last but not least, we have Gasoline futures on the move higher with Crude. The trend up is starting to show up at the pumps; gasoline on the rise headed into spring with all the talk of inflation is something to watch over the next few weeks as well. Lots to keep an eye on this week, these are just a few of the potential markets movers to be aware of. Trade well!

19858,2021-03-09 14:33:05,Remote Siberian data center reaps rewards of bitcoin rally,"By Alexander Marrow MOSCOW (Reuters) - Four thousand kilometres from Moscow near the shores of the Angara River, a Russian firm operating a vast data centre run on cheap local hydroelectric power is reaping the rewards of bitcoin's surging prices and plans to double its power output this year. BitRiver hosts equipment at its flagship 100-megawatt data centre in the city of Bratsk, along with other smaller sites, for foreign miners of the cryptocurrency from the United States, Europe and Japan who want to harness the region's cheap energy. The company could already be responsible for as much as 2% of global bitcoin mining, Chief Executive Igor Runets estimated, but added precise figures in the sector were hard to come by. The price of bitcoin has risen almost 300% since the start of November and topped $50,000 dollars for the first time last month, as Tesla Inc bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and other large companies and investment houses followed small traders into the asset. Bitcoin is earned -- or 'mined' -- by using your computer to help process the uncrackable ""blockchains"" or digital transaction records that underpin the currency. This requires huge computing capacity, and a lot of electricity, and so is mostly done with huge machines in aircraft hangar-sized warehouses in the cooler climates of Iceland, Canada, northern China and Russia, where it costs less to disperse the heat generated. The rewards for those who can verify transactions in the process which produces bitcoins have never been greater. ""Current demand from our clients exceeds 700 megawatts and is approaching one gigawatt,"" said Runets. ""We will of course continue to build data processing centres. In 2021, we plan to reach 300 megawatts of power."" Another 100-megawatt centre is already under construction in the neighbouring Buryatiya region, Runets said. Big deals with foreign firms, such as one last December which saw 14 lorries full of equipment arrive in Bratsk, can boost the local economy and are a sign that BitRiver has become a global player, he said in a company video. Story continues BITCOIN VOLATILITY Russia granted cryptocurrencies legal status last year, but banned them from being used as a means of payment. ""Current legislation in Russia does not hamper us in any way,"" Runets said. ""It allows us to host foreign clients' computing equipment on Russian territory with settlements for this in dollars or roubles."" This arrangement reduces the financial impact of bitcoin price swings on BitRiver. ""When bitcoin falls or rises, my profit, my revenue remains almost unchanged,"" Runets said. ""This financial stability in a volatile market is very valuable."" More liberal legislation would lead to greater investment from Russian players, Runets added, which could help BitRiver improve on its 2.5x year-on-year revenue growth in 2020. He declined to disclose further financial details. One of the primary concerns levelled at bitcoin miners is their carbon footprint. Runets said BitRiver uses more than 90% green power as it builds data centres in regions with electricity surpluses and renewable energy sources nearby. Russia accounts for about 7% of the world's bitcoin mining, according to Alexander Brazhnikov, executive director of the Russian Association of Cryptoeconomics, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, a figure that does not include grey-market players and those illegally connecting to power grids. Kazakhstan is responsible for a similar figure, while China is the market leader.

168341,2021-05-27 12:00:00,FinCEN’s New Head Says Controversial Trump-Era Crypto Proposal Is Still Pending,"The cryptocurrency industry doesn’t have to worry about an overly burdensome U.S. regulation on unhosted, or private, wallets just yet. “Nothing’s been decided” on the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) proposed rule to collect counterparty data for transactions to unhosted wallets and require currency transaction reports (CTRs) for transactions over $10,000, the acting head of the regulatory agency said Thursday. FinCEN continues to engage with the cryptocurrency industry about the controversial proposed rule, which critics claim would make it difficult – if not impossible – to use certain smart contracts and otherwise impose a heavy compliance burden on exchanges, said Acting Director Michael Mosier in a pre-recorded interview with Jill Carlson at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 conference. Related: Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks: Excluding Crypto Banks From Fed System Is ‘Dangerous’ The rule was proposed at the end of 2020 with support from former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. An originally brief public comment period on the proposal was extended in January, before a second extension gave industry participants 90 days to respond. “There was a point where there was a really strong sense of urgency among political leadership in the last administration for a variety of factors on timing and what the risks and concerns were to address this,” Mosier said Thursday. “And I think what you saw was the moment we were given the ability to extend that comment period we did, and continued on with our engagement with industry on that.” Mosier is one of a number of regulators reviewing the last presidential administration’s actions. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced last week that it was reviewing actions undertaken in 2020 by its former head – Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks – as well. Mosier became the acting head of the domestic financial law enforcement agency this year, succeeding Kenneth Blanco who abruptly stepped down. While he’s been a longtime public servant – working as a state and federal prosecutor prior to his roles at FinCEN – Mosier has also spent time in the private sector, first as an attorney in the technology practice of a law firm, and later as chief technical counsel at crypto analytics firm Chainalysis. Story continues Related: Consensus 2021: Can Privacy Coins, Exchanges and Regulators Coexist? He told Carlson his view of his role stems from his interest in personal sovereignty and innovation, and protecting individuals from financial abuse or having their privacy invaded. “I sort of went into the path of public service doing pro bono work for victims of domestic violence, to help them get protective orders,” he said. “And that really sort of put me more in the personal sovereignty space.” Many individuals were abused financially, Mosier said, and so privacy and personal sovereignty may be two tools to help protect individuals. “Money is a great enabler of a lot of opportunity, but it’s also an enabler and a driver of a lot of exploitation,” Mosier said. “How do you balance that transparency, that’s going to allow people to have faith in the system that they’re dealing with and that they’re not going to be exploited in it … versus having this sort of mix of privacy but also that’s not unaccountable anonymity?” Financial Intelligence Unit Part of FinCEN’s mandate as a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is to look for trends or risks by analyzing data, Mosier said. The agency can also be tasked with studying specific incidents. Mosier referred to the riots that occurred at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 as one issue that FinCEN could study. A blogger sent just over 28 BTC to 22 wallets linked to far-right individuals and entities ahead of the riot. “There was cryptocurrency involved … [about] $500,000, which actually is more than enough to fund something like [the riot],” he said. “And that’s the sort of thing that activates Congress.” It turned out the crypto landed in hosted wallets (wallets linked to exchanges), but Mosier said Congress may ask how he is watching for other potential domestic terrorist attacks and the possible use of crypto. Ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure like hospitals is another similar issue that FinCEN must watch for, he said, indicating that if FinCEN can proactively spot and address these concerns, it could prevent overly burdensome regulations from being implemented. “When Congress acts, it’s very difficult to undo anything they do or modulate it, whereas if we can say, ‘Well, actually, we’re making a lot of progress,’ which doesn’t necessarily mean a rulemaking at all, it just means that we’re coming up with solutions. That’s the place where you want to be,” he said. Industry engagement FinCEN’s proposed rulemaking drew a “very strong outpouring” of criticism after the agency introduced it, Carlson noted, asking how the crypto industry can better engage with policymakers who are designing regulations around the 12-year-old industry. “It’s important to understand that not everybody in government is inherently suspicious of crypto,” Mosier said. “There’s a lot of people that are very interested in it and feel like it has incredible potential, including on the financial inclusion side, but also just the technical solution to a lot of policy issues.” Industry participants should engage with those policymakers who are either pro-crypto or at least curious about the technology “in a non-negative way” to help them understand what the technical solutions to certain policy questions would look like. They should also acknowledge the risks in these conversations, Mosier’s said, joking: “Twitter might not be as conducive to that.” Some of these government employees have been looking at crypto since 2011, he said. “Don’t just send us your lawyers,” he said. “Send in the technical experts, the core developers.” Related Stories Crypto Exchange Kraken ‘Still On Track’ for 2022 Public Listing White House Cyber Adviser Highlights Potential for Misuse of Crypto",39883.0,0.17,39854.47,0.1,39666.82,-0.37,39387.47,-1.07,39814.85

ABitcoin(CRYPTO:BTC) wallet valued at $250 million has sprung back to life after an eight-year hiatus, triggering a wave of speculation among cryptocurrency enthusiasts.
What Happened: A Bitcoin wallet, initially valued at around $3 million in 2017, has recently become active after eight years of dormancy. The wallet now holds a staggering $250 million worth of Bitcoin.
Such occurrences usually set off a storm of speculation within the cryptocurrency community. Some members have suggested that the wallet’s owner may have rediscovered their private keys, leading to the sudden activity.

Previously, a dormant Bitcoin whale holding $29.3 million also became active after several years of inactivity. In 2024, several Satoshi-era whales suddenly resumed activity, including a wallet containing 2,000 Bitcoins mined in 2010 that made a transfer for the first time in 14 years.
Earlier on Sunday, a massive $252 million was transferred to an unknown wallet, according to Whale Alert data. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $84,334.
Why It Matters: The sudden resurgence of dormant Bitcoin whales can significantly impact the cryptocurrency market. The movement of such large amounts of Bitcoin can create waves in the market, potentially leading to price volatility.
This could potentially signal selling pressure, which may affect Bitcoin’s price. The re-emergence of these whales, coupled with the recent transfer of $252 million to an unknown wallet, underscores the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market.

Top economist Mohamed El-Erian said the latest mess in crypto markets spurred by FTX will keep regulators up at night as they scramble to play catch-up.
In an interview withCNBCon Wednesday, the chief economic adviser at Allianz said what's happening with cryptocurrencies is ""stunning.""
""The good news is, unlike banks they are not part of the payments and settlement system so we don't have to worry about big systemic effects,"" El-Erian said.
He warned that crypto regulators will be playing ""massive"" catch-up in response to the market downfall.
""The amount of irresponsible leveraging that has been taken, the cross ownership of assets. This sort of thing should not happen,"" El-Erian said. ""What they are seeing, I suspect, will keep them up at night.""
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission opened investigations into FTX months ago as to whether the the crypto exchange mishandled customer funds,according to the Wall Street Journal.
Cryptocurrencies took a tumble on Tuesday after Binance'seye-popping announcementthat it intends to buy FTX. In a bizarre turn of events, Binance on Wednesday U-turned on thedeal, saying issues at Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange are beyond their ability to control or help.
The initial news of the rescue deal however, which came in response to a liquidity crunch at FTX, sent chills through the crypto market because it renewed fears about liquidity risks in the industry.
The market was still under pressure on Thursday after Bankman-Fried said FTX could go bankrupt if it doesn't receive a cash injection of $8 billion.
In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin dipped 0.7% to $17,474, extending its slide so far this week.

24944,2020-10-26 08:23:50,Price of Gold Fundamental Daily Forecast – Short-Term Rangebound as Stronger Dollar Caps Gains,"Gold futures are trading lower on Monday, but clawing back most of its earlier losses. The catalysts behind the initial weakness was a stronger U.S. Dollar and a stalemate in the negotiations over the new U.S. coronavirus aid package. Technical factors and the remote chance of a stimulus deal could be providing some support.
At 07:54 GMT,December Comex goldis trading $1903.10, down $2.10 or -0.11%.
Traders could also be monitoring the U.S. presidential election polls. Democratic candidate Joe Biden currently leads in the polls. His agenda is expected to be supportive for gold because he is expected to flood the economy with fiscal aid, which would weaken the U.S. Dollar and drive up inflation.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that she expected a White House response on Monday regarding the latest stimulus spending plan – but there have been few tangible signs that a long-stalled deal is actually nearer.
A jump in global coronavirus cases, new restrictions and potential shutdowns should be supportive for gold prices over the longer-term because it will mean that central banks will have to continue to be more accommodative, but most of all, it drives up the urgency to continue to provide fiscal stimulus.
Most investors believe the U.S. will eventually reach a new fiscal stimulus deal, and the idea of more stimulus from the European Central Bank is starting to gain traction.
On Friday, Johns Hopkins University reported more than 83,000 new infections in the United States on both Friday and Saturday after outbreaks in Sun Belt states. This number beat the previous record of roughly 77,300 cases set in July.
The hits just kept on coming over the weekend when White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Sunday that the U.S. will not get control of the pandemic amid the surge in new cases.
Meanwhile, the resurgence of the coronavirus in Europe has continued apace in recent days, with France reporting a record daily rise in infections on Sunday, Italy ordering bars to close early and shutting public gyms and Spain issuing a nationwide curfew to stem a worsening outbreak.
The short-term direction is too tough to call because of the possible swings in the U.S. Dollar. Longer-term, the market continues to be well-supported by central bank accommodations.
Basically, this means, we can live with short-term volatility until the stimulus deal is worked out and the presidential election results are settled because we are confident that central bank monetary stimulus will encourage longer-term investors to buy the dips. Any fiscal stimulus should spike prices higher, but we just have to wait for that.

68907,2023-08-29 17:15:01,Bitcoin saved from dismal August by landmark Grayscale ruling,"By Tom Wilson
LONDON (Reuters) -Bitcoin's gains from a U.S. court ruling that bolsters future prospects for retail investor-friendly funds have rescued the original cryptocurrency from a dismal month, offering new optimism over its longer-term outlook.
The Securities and Exchange Commission's denial of Grayscale Investments' proposal was ""arbitrary and capricious"", a federal court said on Tuesday, handing the crypto asset manager a landmark victory that could pave the way for the first product of its kind.
Top cryptocurrency bitcoin gained more than 7% on the news, setting it on course for its best day since March and cutting some of the heavy losses incurred over the summer.
It was last trading at $27,920.
Bruised by dampened demand for riskier assets caused by surging U.S. Treasury yields, as well as a fall in volatility over quiet summer trading, bitcoin had before the ruling been on course for its worst month since November 2022, when tumult reigned following the demise of the FTX exchange. It is now on track for monthly losses of around 5%.
The win for Grayscale is likely to now factor into the SEC's future decisions for spot bitcoin ETFs filed by several major financial firms this year, including the world's largest asset manager BlackRock, investors said.
Any advent of spot bitcoin ETFs could help the crypto industry tap a glut of previously untapped retail investor cash, in turn bolstering the price of bitcoin.
""The market has been waiting for a catalyst for some time, and it is likely that this ruling will be taken as a significant sign that a BTC spot ETF is not far off,"" said Noelle Acheson, an economist who has tracked the crypto sector for several years.
Still, bitcoin's prospects remain tied to the performance of wider markets, some investors said.
""Crypto is still considered growth and speculation, and a muddy macro picture will keep a lid on the market,"" said Anders Kvamme Jensen, founder of brokerage AKJ.

50084,2021-08-17 21:35:39,Former Zcash developer hired to lead Jack Dorsey’s Bluesky,"Twitter supremo Jack Dorsey has revealed that Jay Graber – a former Zcash developer – will be masterminding his new Bluesky initiative. Bluesky, first mentioned publicly in 2019, aims to deliver a decentralised social media ecosystem in response to regulatory encroachment on social media platforms. In a string of tweets, Dorsey explained the Bluesky project was driven by numerous concerns he had with the way in which social media has developed – away from being a platform for connection, into an algorithmic marketing machine. Second, the value of social media is shifting away from content hosting and removal, and towards recommendation algorithms directing one’s attention. Unfortunately, these algorithms are typically proprietary, and one can’t choose or build alternatives. Yet. — jack⚡️ (@jack) December 11, 2019 The tweets also cited the ever-increasing demands of centralised regulators and the appearance of more frequent negative content, particularly surrounding political controversies. Finally, new technologies have emerged to make a decentralized approach more viable. Blockchain points to a series of decentralized solutions for open and durable hosting, governance, and even monetization. Much work to be done, but the fundamentals are there. — jack⚡️ (@jack) December 11, 2019 The Twitter visionary went on to explain that blockchain offered cutting-edge decentralised solutions that could bring about a more democratic and immutable form of social networking online. Dorsey’s initiative has excited many, and the public appointment of well-respected crypto developer Jay Graber represents an exciting step with the project now lead by a man with a deep understanding of start-ups in the crypto space. Story continues Graber has wasted no time in highlighting the progress he has already made on the new social network ecosystem, revealing he conducted a systematic ecosystem review with a team of blockchain builders and crypto creatives in January. Over the past year, I’ve been working closely with a group of thinkers and builders from the decentralized social ecosystem. We published an ecosystem review in January, and my next step will be hiring for the bluesky team. — Jay Graber (@arcalinea) August 16, 2021 He also drew attention to Bluesky’s keenness for partnerships with other social media market leaders, expressing hope that the scheme would receive support and collaboration from other platforms. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was among the first to applaud Jay’s appointment at Bluesky, suggesting the Zcash developer would be able to enhance the coding-side of the project roadmap. Jay will be leading @bluesky ! Another step towards decentralizing Twitter and social media. Now we can move much faster, and through code. https://t.co/9RLR4Je8GE — jack⚡️ (@jack) August 16, 2021 This is the latest in a series of recent moves by Dorsey to dominate the crypto space, following his $29B takeover of e-credit company AfterPay.

87551,2024-07-31 18:19:00,Trump reportedly raises more than $20 million at The Bitcoin Conference,"Last week, Trump became the first major-party candidate to speak at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville. He joins RFK, who first spoke at the conference last year in Miami and returned as a speaker in 2024.
Trump announced in May that his campaign would start accepting crypto donations, and has raised $4 million through digital assets, a small percentage of the over $200 million he has raised in total.
Following his speech, Trump held a fundraiser where he reportedly raised $21 million. He had sold seats to a private meetingat $800,000 per pop. His speech represented a change from his previous positions towards crypto. He promised that under his administration the U.S. would not sell any of its bitcoin reserves. Bitcoiners and crypto enthusiasts are also encouraged by the fact that his VP pick, J.D. Vance has publicly disclosed ownership of at least $100,000 in bitcoin in 2022.
Trump is not the only presidential candidate to embrace bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Before the Bitcoin Conference, reports came out that Kamala Harris was interested in speaking at the event as well. Her campaign aides andsenior Democrats have also reportedly met with industry leaders to try and reset the relationship between the Democratic party and the industry.
Democrats still remain split on the issue. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has been a longtime critic of cryptocurrencies and their use in illegal activities, criticized a recent bill that would undo much of the SEC’s guidance surrounding cryptocurrencies. 32 democrats voted with republicans, who incorporated supporting crypto as an official part of the party platform earlier this year, to send this bill to Biden’s desk.
This is the first time Congress has voted on a stand alone crypto bill, allowing legislators to officially come out in favor or against the space. Due to the opposition of many democrats, industry leaders remain skeptical about Harris’ ability to sway opinions in favor of crypto.",66370.0,0.06,66170.01,-0.24,66530.0,0.3,66096.01,-0.35,66328.01
42130,2018-08-01 23:15:08,Op-ed: Bitcoin Cash’s First Anniversary — Where Are We Now?,"August 1st marks the first birthday of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), the cryptocurrency that launched (forked) a year ago from bitcoin with the simple purpose of increasing the space available to make transactions through the bitcoin protocol.
The last year has seen bitcoin truly enter the realm of public consciousness, but increasing usage has also brought growing demand for space on the bitcoin blockchain. At the start of 2017, bitcoin transactions took approximately 20 minutes to confirm and cost $0.35. Six months later, in June, those numbers had risen to over six hours for confirmation and fifteen times the cost: $5.50 USD. Given the increasing popularity to perform peer-to-peer transactions across the world, the bitcoin community ran into a formidable roadblock in scaling their decentralized network to match demand. While bitcoin has received the limeshare of attention, a year on, where does BCH stand and what is its function in the cryptocurrency ecosystem?
The central mechanism governing bitcoin transactions —the blockchain— is used to describe a plethora of projects utilizing the same underlying security apparatus. The size of the blocks dictates how much information can be stored on any given block. This size limit was originally set at 1MB in response to threats posed by denial of service (DoS) attacks (think spamming) from the early frantic days of getting bitcoin to stand on its own two feet.
By the time June rolled around last year, while confirmation times and transaction costs skyrocketed, a group of developers decided the easiest, most natural way to avoid cramping growth was to increase the amount of information that can be registered per block, leading to a ‘hard fork’ that changed the consensus rules from bitcoin’s. The catalyst driving developers seeking this change was to preserve, immediately, bitcoin’s status as an electronic cash system, whereby small amounts of money could be easily transferred for very little cost. This enables bitcoin to grow as a currency, specifically as a medium of exchange, in retail, commerce, and markets that are unbanked where people cannot afford high transaction fees – such as Venezuela where monetary inflation isestimated above 40,000%.
In June, the stakeholders and developers seeking to implement a block-size increase organized under the name Bitcoin ABC, increasing the block size limit to 8MB on August 1st, 2017: This launched BCH as a parallel network with all bitcoin account balances copied onto a new ledger encoded with a larger block size limit. BCH found its first block at 6:15 UTC, and was trading at around $230 USD. The network was processing around 7000 transactions per day with transaction fees under 20 cents (seeblock explorer). The hard fork was officially a success, and BCH was born.
The following weeks of August saw the mining difficulty decrease in order to bring down confirmation times using a tool that ABC developers encoded called Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA), which was designed to ensure the survival of the BCH blockchain in the event that the cryptographic difficulty was too high for the mining power available on the network. If the difficulty is too high for the amount of computers competing to secure new blocks, then transaction confirmations take too long. The problem was that after EDA was used successfully to level out the difficulty levelled out, miners began to exploit differences between BTC and BCH in order to optimize mining profits. These miners that switched back and forth caused spikes in confirmation times in order to drop the difficulty of BCH by triggering EDA making it more profitable to mine. This caused swings of miners to enter BCH network while the difficulty was lowered by the EDA, who would eventually exit once the difficulty properly adjusted, which had long-term ramifications for the integrity of the network.
By November, the fix was calculated, ready to implemented, and the various groups of developers managing BCH clients came together to implement a protocol fixing the swings in confirmation times caused by the emergency difficulty adjustment. This was crucial as the entire cryptocurrency market was undergoing a massive influx of investment, causing prices to ‘moon’, which in turn brought more people into the market, generating an unprecedented bull run that generated headlines across the world. Fortunately, BCH blocktimes stabilized to the correct 10-minute time frame, and the system performed smoothly during heavy traffic that occured in and out of the market between November and February this year. During this time, BCH saw block sizes of up to 4MB while maintaining transaction fees during these spikes under a dollar, which demonstrated proof of the immediate utility of larger block size limits and the role BCH sought to fulfill. After the price surge rebounded from record-breaking highs, developers from different clients running BCH’s blockchain came together in May 2018 to increase the block size limit once again to 32 MB.
The second significant change that was made in the May hard fork was to re-enable certain functions that had been turned off in the protocol’s scripting language a long time ago, and introduce a couple new ones too. These machine codes, called “Satoshi Op-codes” by the BCH community, allow developers to create different types of metadata implementations, i.e. programmable money. By having the ability to call these functions, developers can create “colored coins” or representative tokens that function as smart contracts. These are tokens that can be programmed by individual organizations to correspond to bonds, stocks, precious metals, commodities, and any physical or virtual object.
These op-codes broaden BCH developers’ tools to interact with scripting on top of the blockchain, which, in tandem with more space, allows for non-payment related information to be written and accessed on-chain. This has led to innovation in community engagement with applications like the social network—Memo, and a second layer application calledWormhole, which operates by linking a token called Wormhole Cash to the BCH blockchain.
One year after its creation, BCH has expanded onto 19 different services, e.g. Bitpay, Coingate, ViaBTC, Coinpayments, and CoinDance. Bitcoin Cash is also involved in fourteen different projects, e.g., OpenBazaar, Joystream, and Counterparty, and tradable on 41 different exchanges. Ultimately utilizing cryptocurrencies as a digital currency is what will push the entire industry forward. #HODL (holding coins as an investment) has been a rallying call for many within the cryptocurrency community, but I hope that the rallying call to #BUIDL (build blockchain solutions and decentralized businesses) will galvanize sustainable and practical use of Bitcoin and BCH alike, building a new age of peer-to-peer financial sovereignty open and accessible to all.

26998,2018-04-14 11:17:00,3 Safe Dividend Stocks for a Chaotic Market,"The stock market has been volatile over the past few months, partly thanks to President Donald Trump's proposals for new tariffs aimed at China and other trading partners. However, patient investors can ride out the storm with three of my favoritedividendstocks --AT&T;(NYSE: T),Johnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ), andLas Vegas Sands(NYSE: LVS).
AT&T has raised its dividend annually for over three decades, making it aDividend Aristocrat. AT&T currently pays a forward dividend yield of 5.6%, which is nearly triple the S&P 500's average yield of 2%. It spent just 68% of its free cash flow on dividends over the past 12 months, meaning it has enough money to cover the dividend, making a dividend decrease unlikely.

AT&T is America's second-largest wireless carrier, top wireline services provider, and biggest pay TV provider. If its planned takeover ofTime Warner(NYSE: TWX)is approved, it will also become one of the biggest media companies in the world.
Thatmassive ecosystemgives Ma Bell plenty of bundling options -- selling people more than one service -- which widens its edge over competitors likeVerizonandT-Mobile. AT&T's stock is currently weighed down by near-term headwinds -- including slowing smartphone upgrades in the U.S., losses of video subscribers, high debt levels, antitrust concerns about the Time Warner buyout, and higher interest rates knocking down interest in dividend stocks.
But over the long term, AT&T has repeatedly bounced back from micro and macro challenges while generating steady income for patient investors. The stock is fairly insulated from the trade clashes between the U.S. and China, and its downside potential should be limited by its high yield and its low forwardhttps://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/01/17/how-to-use-the-pe-ratio.aspxP/E of 10.
Johnson & Johnson's three core businesses -- pharmaceutical products, consumer healthcare, and medical devices -- are so well-diversified that it's tough for any headwind to knock the 132-year-old company off course. J&J's growth might look glacial on a quarterly basis, but it's generated slow and steady growth over the years.
Between 2007 and 2017, its annual revenue rose 25% and its adjusted earnings per share jumped 76%. Its stock nearly doubled over the past decade. The company pays a forward dividend yield of 2.6%, and it's raised its payout annually for over five decades -- which makes it another dependable Dividend Aristocrat. Those hikes, which used up just 50% of J&J's free cash flow over the past 12 months, should continue for the foreseeable future.
Trade tensions, a soft dollar, and generic competition for former blockbuster drugs like Remicade are all near-term headwinds for J&J, but analysts still expect its revenue and earnings to rise 6% and 11%, respectively, this year. Those are solid growth figures for an all-weather stock that trades at just 16 times forward earnings.
Las Vegas Sands is the biggest casino operator in the world. It owns the Venetian and Palazzo in Las Vegas, the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, and five major properties in Macau. Sands generates most of its profits from Asia.
Image source: Las Vegas Sands.
Last quarter, 59% of Sands' consolidated hold-normalized adjusted propertyEBITDA, came from Macau, 30% came from Singapore, and the remaining 11% came from the United States. Sands' dependence on Asia will rise as it proceeds with its potential$10 billion expansioninto Japan, which recently opened the door to integrated casino resorts.
Gaming revenues in Macau rose 22% annually in March, beating expectations for 13%-18% growth and marking the region's 20th straight month of year-over-year growth. That's why analysts expect Sands' revenue and earnings to rise 5% and 9%, respectively, this year.
Sands stock might not seem cheap at 21 times forward earnings, but it still trades at a discount to its rivalWynn, which has a forward P/E of 24. Sands also pays a forward dividend yield of 4.2%, and it's raised that payout annually for five straight years. It spent 79% of its free cash flow on those dividend payments over the past 12 months, indicating a dividend cut is not imminent.

State-ownedGlobal Timeswarned Musk on Tuesday not to “bite the hand that feeds you”, according to a translation of a Mandarin idiom byCNBCreporter Eunice Yoon, who first spottedthe post on WeChat.
Twitter's new owner has proven useful for the regime thanks to his efforts to document collusion between Big Tech and the U.S. government to censor free speech through hisTwitter Files.
This helped hand a propaganda victory to Beijing, with the same state publication declaring the United States to be “the biggest hypocrite in the world”.
On Sunday, however, Musk apparently crossed the line when he amplified tweets drawing attention to allegations the U.S. government altered a coronavirus found in bats at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, creating COVID-19 in the process.
This is despite the fact that Twitter is officially blocked in China and requires a virtual private network to be accessed.
Referring to unsubstantiated speculation that Anthony Fauci, ex-director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, indirectly oversaw the weaponization of the virus, Musk posted “he did it via a pass-through organization (EcoHealth).”
The narrative that COVID-19 resulted from experiments on Chinese soil directly contradicts the regime’s claim it most likely originated naturally, a claim it believes is substantiated through ajoint WHO-China studyconducted in early 2021.
“Some may think Musk’s remarks were only attacking Fauci and did not name China directly,” theGlobal Timeswrote on its official WeChat social media account on Tuesday. Yet the posts the Twitter andTeslaCEO forwarded all linked the source of the novel coronavirus back to China, it argued.
At a time whentensions are highfollowing the scandal over a Chinese balloon shot down by the Pentagon, that tenuous connection is cause enough, according to the paper: “His remarks have been used by right-wingers in the U.S. hostile to China as well as anti-China media.""
Beijing’s regime is not one to tolerate lightly what it perceives to be transgressions.
When Mercedes-Benz used the Dalai Lama in a post onInstagram, a platform likewise blocked in China, the then-CEO of the German carmakerpersonally apologized.
Musk, who has been quick to scold the U.S. government and even called a sitting President a “damp sock puppet”, has held his tongue when it comes to criticizing China.
That may be because Tesla, even more so than Mercedes, is heavily dependent on China both as a market and a manufacturing hub: GigaShanghai can build more than 750,000 vehicles a year, according to the company, equating to roughly 40 percent of its global installed capacity.
Beyond serving customers in the country, the factory also exports the Model 3 sedan to Europe, supplies the bulk of right-hand drive markets like the UK,JapanandIndia, and is the exclusive manufacturer of the standard range entry Model Y.
Last year’s extensive COVID lockdown thatparalysed GigaShanghaidemonstrated just how crucial the plant is for Tesla’s health. In July, Musk confessed he sold the bulk of its Bitcoin holdings, since,in his words, “we were concerned about overall liquidity of the company.”
Shanghai became such a key hub for Musk’s operations, thanks in part to the country’s vast pool of low-paid manufacturing workers.
Some regularly work 12 hour days under what’s called 996: from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. On average they can earn theequivalent of about $13,500a year.
“They won’t just be burning the midnight oil, they will be burning the 3 am oil,” hesaid in May. “They won’t even leave the factory type of thing, whereas in America people are trying to avoid going to work at all.”
Musk has not issued a response to Global Times, but he has in the past backed down from his dogmatic approach to free speech, saying Twitter would allow it to the maximum extent allowed by local laws. On Tuesday, Twitter also issued new guidelines cracking down onviolent speech.

Bitcoin Offshoot War Gets Price-Violent
Some minor earthquakes are happening in the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) space. “Minor” in comparison to the ultra-bubble mania at the end of 2017 that proved to be the bubble of all bubbles in human history (so far), but major compared to almost any other asset beyond $1 billion in market cap. Dr. Craig Wright, the extremely controversial Australian computer scientist who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder of Bitcoin, now claimshe has accessto a cache of 1,100,111 bitcoins that were mined in the very early days of the cryptocurrency by Nakamoto, a pseudonym for who knows what or who yet. Thanks to a bonded courier that supposedly has given Wright access to this cache until now locked away in a “Tulip Trust,” (a possible homage to the Tulip bubble mania of 1637) Wright now, possibly, has the ability to conclusively prove that he is indeed the pseudonymous Nakamoto.
If he fails to follow through, it is likely that he and his Bitcoin-offshoot project known as Bitcoin SV, will be widely discredited. However, if he does follow through and unlock the enormous cache, he will then, according to his stated intentions, slowly sell off the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash (BCH-USD) stash in pre-split coins in favor of Bitcoin SV.
Cryptocurrency traders have been front-running the assumption that Wright really does have access to this enormous cache in a manic buying wave over the last 4 days, with many possibly not aware of the intricacies of the case or what is even going on. The buying frenzy has rocketed both the market cap and price of Bitcoin SV past Bitcoin Cash, making Bitcoin SV the 4thlargest cryptocurrency by market cap despite it being delisted by most major exchanges in what has been an ongoing crypto cat fight for reasons that only hardcore crypto geeks claim to understand.
The main difference between Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash is that Bitcoin SV is designed to have no inherent limit on its block size, supposedly returning it to the original specifications of the original Bitcoin White Paper supposedly penned by Satoshi Nakamoto, who is supposedly Craig Wright, according to Craig Wright and his allies, or supposedly not, according to people who think Craig Wright is a liar. The point being that with Bitcoin SV, massive blocks of unlimited size can in theory be built on by businesses, which is not “supposedly” since this point, at least, is quantitatively verifiable as of the next hard fork and software upgrade taking place next month on the SV blockchain. Bitcoin has a block size limit of 1MB, and Bitcoin Cash 30MB.
Trump Upset Apple Doesn’t Roll Over On Belly, Open iPhones
Speaking of President Trump,he tweetedsome choice words for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), as is his wont as the social media president. He was mad because the company declined the government’s request to unlock iPhones used by the Saudi Arabian shooter in Pensacola, Florida, even though if the federal government wanted to, it could unlock the phone easily without Apple’s help. The president’s tweet suggested something along the lines of the late presidential candidate Harry Browne, who famously stated that the government offers one a crutch after breaking one’s leg.
Specifically, he suggested that Apple help the government because Trump has helped Apple navigate the trade war with China, which hurts Apple, and which Trump himself started. Using CAPS intermittently, Trump wrote, closing with his MAGA mantra, “We are helping Apple all of the time on TRADE and so many other issues, and yet they refuse to unlock phones used by killers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements. They will have to step up to the plate and help our great Country, NOW! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.” Apple responded that it was helping, but that it would not give the government a backdoor, which would enable them to hack into any iPhone at any time, which is what Trump was essentially requesting.
Cloudy With a Chance of Jet Fuel, Delta ‘Concerned’
Delta (NYSE:DAL)isn’t so ecstaticabout the emergency dump of jet fuel on California schools, but it is unclear what the airliner in question was supposed to do considering the circumstances that necessitated it make an emergency landing in Los Angeles due to engine troubles. “The aircraft landed safely after a release of fuel, which was required as part of normal procedure to reach a safe landing weight. We are in touch with Los Angeles World Airports and the LA County Fire Department and share concerns regarding reported minor injuries to adults and children at a school in the area,”said a Delta spokesperson. Nobody was lit on fire as a result of the unexpected rain of jet fuel, thankfully.

79741,2023-09-21 19:38:26,NFTs Aren’t Dead Just Yet (But the MSM Might Be),"Rollingstone.comhit the traffic motherlode today with aneye-catching postcalling the end of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The piece, “Your NFTs Are Actually – Finally – Totally Worthless,” picks up a new study bydappGambl, a community of finance experts, and runs with it hard. And it hit a nerve. As of writing (lunchtime Thursday), the post is top-trending on their website and on Google itself. Type the term “NFTs” into your browser, and it appears at the apex of the search results.
To be sure, there is plenty of meat here and the headline isn’t completely wrong, at least judged by the loose standards of headline writers. It’s sort of true that most NFTs are, indeed, worthless. The study found that, out of a sample of 73,257NFTcollections, 69,795 have a market cap of zero ETH. That’s 95% of the total, which is almost “all” of them. The study says that 23 million people now hold NFTs with no value, which is certainly tough for those investors.
“Just 21 percent of the collections included in the study can claim full ownership, meaning around four out of every five collections remains unsold,” the writer, Miles Klee, notes. “With buyers becoming more discerning, ‘projects that lack clear use cases, compelling narratives, or genuine artistic value are finding it increasingly difficult to attract attention and sales.’”
But are NFTs really dead, as the post suggests? Not exactly.
While trading volumes are certainly down, they are not non-existent. Data collected by The Blockshowsthat trading reached about $63 million last week. That’s a far cry from the $360 million-plus weekly volume we saw in February. But it’s also not nothing.
Plus, there’s the 5% of collections that are actually worth something. The post says the study explains why “you don’t see people hawking ugly cartoon apes on the internet as much anymore.” But Bored Ape NFTs are actually trading respectably. The average price of a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT is about $42,000.
More important than precise trading dynamics is what the post shows about how the mainstream media tends to work. Publications search for extremes, absolute highs and lows that make for arresting headlines. Just last November, Rolling Stone put out aheadlinesaying “The NFT Bubble Has Burst, but the Value For Creators Is Just Heating Up.” Last summer, it loudly touted its own tie-up with … one of the most famous NFT collections around, theBored Ape Yacht Club. “This is a rare chance for the public to take home a piece of art from BAYC with Rolling Stone’s stamp of approval,” the promo piece said. Now Rolling Stone has an opposite sort of message similarly filled with hyperbole.
Anyone who has covered crypto for a while has seen this moviemany times before. Bitcoin has been written off countless times, yet it’s still trundling out blocks. It has millions of followers and the price is now $26,000-plus, which, again, isn’t nothing.
Of course, there have been highs and lows, but the idea that a technology as useful as NFTs is going away entirely is silly. NFTs are a digital wrapper for non-physical and physical items allowing them to be tracked and traded. That is an idea with wide applicability, whether it’s reflected in art markets or not.
The bigger story here is that media publications are losing credibility because they disingenuously look for extremes when the real world is full of nuance. Many in crypto, as a result, “have already started tuning out the newscycle,” as my colleague Dan Kuhnwrote recentlyof this phenomenon. People are building and developing and ignoring whether the media says the world is up or down. Their reality isn’t framed by what a journalist somewhere says it is; they look at tech and make something useful out of it.

While the Bitcoin network itself does not allow staking (being a proof-of-work blockchain), Babylon's protocol allows users to stake BTC to secure other chains, offering the security of the original cryptocurrency to the wider crypto world.
Babylon enjoyed a banner year in 2024, raising $70 million in a funding round in May andreceiving a stunning response from stakers on its mainnet launch in August.

The protocol was opened fora second round in Octoberand drew 24,000 BTC in around one hour and 40 minutes.
Tse, who also serves as an engineering professor at Stanford University, said that the inflows were ""way beyond our expectations.""

20245,2019-03-12 19:00:27,Mark Zuckerberg versus the Winklevoss twins – Round two,"The film The Social Network dramatised the creation of Facebook, and key to that drama was the battle between the Winklevoss twins and Mark Zuckerberg. The claims ended up being settled with Zuckerberg paying the twins $31 million. Since then, the Winklevoss twins have heavily invested in Bitcoin, jointly becoming one of the largest owners of the cryptocurrency. They also founded the Gemini exchange. With Facebook’s own cryptocurrency moving closer to reality, a battle between these giants could once again take place. This time however, the Winklevoss twins have the early mover advantage over Zuckerberg, although according to recent reports , Zuckerberg’s new cryptocurrency could earn him billions more. Facebook hasn’t had a good time of late in the press. Accusations of being susceptible to helping manipulate elections, privacy fears, deplatforming, and a general decline in usage of Facebook has caused issues for the global powerhouse. That being said, Facebook is still a huge brand, with ownership of both WhatsApp and Instagram. By incorporating a cryptocurrency into these platforms, Zuckerberg could instantly have access to billions of customers. Many of these customers may never have used cryptocurrencies before in their life. One criticism of cryptocurrencies so far is the lack of mainstream adoption they have managed to garner. Zuckerberg’s Facebook Coin could change this. Facebook’s cryptocurrency is unlikely to follow the traditional philosophies of the Cypherpunks. Privacy is a key feature of crypto anarchy, and Facebook has already shown that privacy isn’t high on its list of priorities. How Facebook’s new cryptocurrency will fit into the industry and its potential success will be something to keep a very close eye on. The Winklevoss twins are unlikely to be worried about Facebook’s new cryptocurrency. They have been at the forefront of the industry for a long time. When you have one of the largest Bitcoin holdings in the world and are already filthy rich, I imagine there is little that would worry you in the realm of economics. However, there will be some interest to see these three juggernauts go head to head once more. My money is on the Winklevoss twins personally, but let us know whether you think Zuckerberg has what it takes to supplant Bitcoin.

939,2014-02-24 06:33:38,Mt. Gox's CEO resigns from Bitcoin Foundation,"By Chris Peters
(Reuters) - Mark Karpeles, chief executive of Mt. Gox, the embattled Toyko-based bitcoin exchange, resigned on Sunday from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, in the latest blow to the digital currency.
Jinyoung Lee Englund, a spokesperson for the Bitcoin Foundation - a trade group promoting the adoption of the digital currency, confirmed the news and said the resignation was effective immediately.
The resignation follows a number of technical issues, including a massive cyber attack from unknown sources that has been spamming bitcoin exchanges.
Earlier in February, Mt. Gox, the best-known digital marketplace operator, said it is halting withdrawals indefinitely after it detected ""unusual activity.
Following the halting, the foundation's chief scientist Gavin Andresen defended the currency and criticized Mt. Gox, saying the problem was with exchange, not Bitcoin.
""The issues that Mt. Gox has been experiencing are due to an unfortunate interaction between Mt. Gox's implementation of their highly customized wallet software, their customer support procedures, and their unpreparedness for transaction malleability, a technical detail that allows changes to the way transactions are identified,"" Andresen said in a statement on the Foundation's blog on February 10.
Tokyo-based Mt. Gox was a founding member and one of three elected industry representatives on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation.
Mt. Gox was not immediately available to comment on the news, which was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal.
Charles Shrem, another prominent member of the Bitcoin Foundation, resigned earlier this year after being arrested in connection with an alleged drug scheme involving his bitcoin currency exchange.
Bitcoin prices have been falling fast after Mt. Gox said a ""bug in the bitcoin software"" could allow transaction details to be altered.
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital system of value transfers that is not governed by any central bank, company or government.
No assets back the bitcoin, whose value has fluctuated widely as its visibility has increased. Last September, a bitcoin was worth around $150. By late December the value was near the $1,000 mark.
Mt. Gox bitcoins traded at about $232 in Monday trading in Tokyo, while the Bitstamp index bitcoin traded at around $568.

24350,2018-03-23 16:11:13,"Trump Likes Chaos, Investors Don't","In a nutshell: news from the White House is a headwind for stocks
• Trump wants to appear unpredictable; he relishes chaos/conflict
• CBS to air Stormy Daniels interview on March 25th
• Trump tweets are market negative, especially tirade tweets
• Revolving door at the White House
• National Security Advisor McMaster replaced by Bolton (hawkish on North Korea)
• Protectionist sentiment creating uncertainty in the market
• New chief economic advisor, Larry Kudlow wants a tough stance on China
Large caps have been under-performing for the past week due to the uncertainty surrounding theTrump tariffs and the potential for trade wars. The DJIA (INDEXDJX:DJI) had a negative techical signal after breaking lower out of this triangle formation. DJIA fell -724 pts on Thursday and has its initial target on the breakout at the Feb low which is approximately its 200 day moving average*. The 200 day was hit in the E-Mini S&P futures twice and SPX once during the February crush. The 200dma has yet to be tested in the industrial average. The extension target out of this formation is down at 21600.
The Dow futures (YMM8:CME) were lower Thursday night, but held a key Fibonacci retracement and potential reversal level. This morning we are seeing buyers enter early on what is likely some unwind after yesterday’s big sell-off. The .786 retracement at 23702 in the futures is the first key to potential reversal or continued downside momentum. Those that follow Dow Theory have some room before they get a signal for further damage to the market.
A Dow Theory sell signal would be produced with a settle below the recent lows in DJIA and Transports. The Dow Theory plays out like this: both the Dow Industrial Average and Dow Transportation Average have a significant decline after hitting new highs, the subsequent rally fails to produce new highs and both averages then fall below their recent significant closing lows. See closing levels to watch below. These chart pictures were taken before Friday’s open, but it’s the settlements that are key.
Even with the Fed raising rates (as expected) this week, bonds rallied after the Fed decision. Investors moved into safe haven bonds and out of equities. This chart showsiShares Barclays 20+ Yr Treas.Bond(NASDAQ:TLT) vsSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSE:SPY) climbing above the descending trend line that had been key resistance the last few months. This is not what you want to see if you are looking for stocks to regain their strength.
Part of the reason is that there is major resistance in the 30-year yield around 3.25 percent. 30-year yield has held below its 100-month moving average since April of 1985! It also appears that fixed income traders are focusing on a faster pace from the Fed likely to induce a recession in the foreseeable future.
Another reason for the strength in US bond market has been the rally in European fixed income. The German Bund has been firm since the February volatility crisis. This week it climbed back above its 200-day moving average, which has been a very good pivotal point.
Something that may be concerning to the overall market strength is the potential for passive investors to pull out or change strategies. TLT is the most popular bond ETF for investors seeking long term Treasury exposure, SPY is the most popular equity index ETF. Being long both is a simple passive strategy. TLT+SPY broke its 200dma for one day during the vol-crisis in February and is back testing the 200 day on Thursday’s close. A clean break and settle below the 200-day would strain the resolve on passive investors and passive strategies.
May Crude Oil (CLK8) broke out of a short term triangle formation earlier in the week and crude oil has held a positive tone even with the sell-off in equities. We are using the 200-month moving average around 65.50 as a general area of resistance for now. Saudi Arabia says that OPEC/Russia production curbs could last into 2019 helping crude oil strength. Shale producers increasing their output in the US is a headwind.
Crude Oil has been the most favorable asset class in our relative value technical analysis models. WTI vs E-Mini S&P held a key trend line support mid-month and is currently testing the year highs in the pair. The underlying crude oil price is helping to lift the energy sector which has been lagging dramatically. This was a crowded trade in January that unwound quickly with the February decline and since it is less crowded now, energy names are seen as a spot for outperformance and rotation. They certainly have some catching up to do and have the most to gain as long as crude oil remains positive.
Gold reversed course this week after breaking out above this short term trend line. Much of gold’s strength has been due to dollar weakness and uncertainties caused by Trump trade war rhetoric.
The US$ Index has remained negative since breaking 91.000 and the 2017 lows. There is short term support at 89.275 and a break of this level would likely see momentum turn negative. Trump and the White House revolving door is adding to dollar weakness even with a Fed that is raising rates which should be a big positive.
The dollar has been especially weak versus the Japanese Yen. After breaking the weekly trend early in the year we are looking for USDJPY to test the 103 handle before finding any support.

68820,2022-01-24 23:54:16,Bitcoin whipsaw shows crypto's 'constant state of price discovery' with over $1T lost,"Bitcoin (BTC-USD) suffered yet another brutal bout of risk-aversion on Monday, briefly tumbling by over 5% below $34,000 before staging a recovery as Wall Street rebounded.
Amid the turmoil, some $130 billion was yanked out of cryptocurrencies between Sunday and Monday, according to Alex Tapscott, Managing Director of Ninepoint Partner's Digital Asset Group.
In the last week alone, Bitcoin shed more than 20% at its troughs, with so-called smart contract currencies faring even worse: Ethereum (ETH-USD) swooned by over 30% within the same period, while Solana (SOL1-USD) has plunged by more than 40%. Outages on the Solana blockchain exacerbated network fees andforced some decentralized finance (DeFi) investors to liquidate their positions.
""Volatility has been the norm historically in digital assets. As an emerging asset class, [crypto's] in a constant state of price discovery,"" Tapscott said on Monday.
""Through their history, digital assets have become accustomed to and therefore resilient to volatility. Even though Bitcoin has been declared dead in the mainstream media more than 400 times, it keeps coming back,"" he added.
And true to form, BTC rallied sharply late into the session on Monday as bargain-hunting buyers of risk assets gave prices a boost. Recently,crypto and stocks have moved in near lock-step.
However, the depth and severity of the downturn couldn't be more stark for crypto, which has shed a collective $1.43 trillion since the peak in early November, as theFederal Reserve moves to reverse crisis-era liquiditythat's fed inflation and inflated asset prices.
Monday's volatile price action sawtwo new Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded funds(ETFs) — launched last fall amid much fanfare — dragged to new record lows (BTF) (BITO) before the rebound. And Bitcoin itself has shed about half of its value since hitting a record last fall near $68,000.
Notably, SOL has dropped more than 40%, contributing to its correction, its underlying blockchain, Solana, suffered its latest outage on Friday. Extending at least two days, the outage excerbated network fees, in some cases,forcing some of its DeFi investors to liquidate their positions.
Over the weekend, more than $1.5 billion of derivatives positions were liquidated according to market analytics dashboard, Coinglass. While growing open interest in derivatives have increasingly exaggerated the volatility of the cryptocurrency market over the past year, Okcoin’s Jason Lau doesn’t believe derivatives will lead the market's next major move as it has in the past.
Factors behind crypto's grim drawdown range far and wide, and include risk aversion, opaque liquidations on crypto-based derivatives, and headwinds from global regulation. All of which suggest that, despite Monday's rebound, a resumption of the sell-off might only be a matter of time.
Lau, along with other crypto market watchers, suggest that the impending end to the Fed's cheap money era in the face of skyrocketing inflation is coloring the sentiment of crypto investors. Lau cited Bitcoin's increasingly tight correlation to the S&P 500 (^GSPC) as a sign of how much emphasis investors have placed on the Fed's policy meeting scheduled for Wednesday.
However, the market’s sensitivity to monetary policy might catch a break this week, Yuya Hasegawa, a market analyst for Tokyo-based crypto exchange Bitbank, told Yahoo Finance.
While the Fed is likely to hike interest rates by 25 basis points, some investors are growing increasingly nervous the Fed will raise by a half a percentage point. But Hasegawa said the committee could likely “tone down” it's hawkish rhetoric down given the current turmoil in the stock market.
The Fed's Open Market Committee ""will refrain from unnerving the market further. So, there is a good chance that there will be no hawkish surprise, which could bring bitcoin's fall to a stop,” Hasegawa added.
Meanwhile, the dramatic sell-off suggests that ""risk-on assets like stocks and Bitcoin are oversold so if hazarding a guess, I would say that we are due for a bounce or rally, especially if the Federal Reserve’s decision from the meeting turns out to be more benign than what some anticipate,"" Jon Wolfenbarger, CEO and Founder of the investment research firm Bull and Bear Profits, told Yahoo Finance.
For investors, the most pertinent question remains how quickly inflation can be quelled. Wolfenbarger suggested longer term hawkish policy must be accepted as the new status quo for many economies, “which is bearish for risk-on assets, particularly given how sensitive investors are today.”
Still, Bitcoin's correlation to risk-sensitive stocks is likely to hold for the near future, raising questions about whether crypto investors can legitimately claim it's a safe-haven, or store of value, like gold.
Yet some, like Baxter Hines, a crypto asset manager at Honeycomb Investments, insisted Bitcoin is still an inflation hedge, especially in emerging economies like El Salvador. The country's president,Nayib Bukele, is one of Bitcoin's most prominent boosters.
“I do think inflation rates affect crypto prices. If you look at countries around the world, whenever you see bouts of hyperinflation such as Turkey and Venezuela, people flock to crypto because it affects their purchasing power,” said Hines.

Instead, the world awoke today to news that Trump was following in the footsteps of luminaries like Haliey ""Hawk Tuah Girl"" Welch and Caitlyn Jenner: by launching his own meme coin, creatively dubbed $TRUMP.
Needless to say, the optics of an incoming American head of state launching his own currency days before an inauguration are absolutely wild; Trump's White House will now be in charge of leading regulation of an industry that he's personally invested in. And we're not talking chump change — since launching last night, the coin's value has spikedfrom nil to around $30 per token, for a market capitalization of over $6 billion.
""My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE!"" Trump wrote, with a link to an online store where supporters can buy the coin. ""It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!""
Ever the flip-flopper, Trump's embrace of crypto is acomplete reversal of his previous position. As recently as 2021, he was lambasting the tech as a ""scam.""
""The currency of this world should be the dollar,"" heseethed toFox Businessat the time. ""And I don't think we should have all of the Bitcoins of the world out there. I think they should regulate them very, very high.""
But Trump seems to have decided his position was more fungible once he smelled the opportunity to make money for himself off the tech. In addition toreaping millions in donationsfrom crypto supporters hoping he'll deregulate the industry, helaunched a line of non-fungible tokens last yearthat made him a pretty penny.
Wading into the muddy waters of crypto, though, represents just one more liability for the once and future president, who's alreadyno stranger to financial crimes. Look no further than Welch and Jenner, both of whom have beendoggedbylawsuitsin the wake of their splashy forays into the space.

Despite the gain, caution lurked in the background after a furious rally spurred worries about an overheated market, with the pendulum swinging in favor of defensive dividend-payers that had underperformed in the past month.

Treasuries climbed across the curve. Longer-dated bonds were earlier whipsawed by large trades that briefly pushed the 30-year yield to nearly 5%. The dollar dropped against most major currencies.
Prices paid to US producers unexpectedly declined by the most in five years suggesting companies are absorbing some of the hit from higher tariffs. Growth in retail sales decelerated notably. Factory production declined for the first time in six months while New York state manufacturing contracted again. And confidence among homebuilders slumped.
“If you are in the stagflation camp, these data aren’t confirming your thesis,” said Jamie Cox at Harris Financial Group. “While growth is slowing, disinflation remains intact.”
The S&P 500 rose 0.4%. The Nasdaq 100 was little changed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.65%. An index of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps fell 1.1%. Canada’s stock benchmark hit a record with an eight-day rally.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries tumbled 10 basis points to 4.43%. A dollar gauge lost 0.2%. Oil slumped as Donald Trump said the US and Iran are getting closer to a deal regarding Tehran’s nuclear program.
Stocks are now trading like last month’s rout never happened. The S&P 500 is about 4% away from an all-time high, while the Nasdaq 100 swung from a bear market back into a bull market. The advance is building as economic tensions between the US and China ease and the White House appears to be softening its approach to trade negotiations.
“I don’t want to get too excited, but we may actually be able to focus on company fundamentals for a while this summer,” said Lamar Villere, portfolio Manager at Villere & Co. “If you’d told me a month ago that stocks would be up year-to-date when my kids finished their exams, I’d have called you a liar.”
Still, there’s little clarity over how the existing levies might impact the US economy or the trajectory the global trade war will take in coming months.
Fed Governor Michael Barr said the economy is on solid ground, but warned tariff-related supply-chain disruptions could lead to lower growth and higher inflation.
Recession remains a possibility as tariff fallout continues to buffet global economies, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon.
“Hopefully we’ll avoid it, but I wouldn’t take it off the table at this point,” Dimon said in a Bloomberg Television interview Thursday at JPMorgan’s annual Global Markets Conference in Paris. “If there is a recession, I don’t know how big it would be or how long it would last.”

Strategists at the firm published a new S&P 500 forecast for 2026, expecting the US equity benchmark to climb to between 6,400 and 6,600 by year’s end. WFII’s new 2025 year-end target is in a range of 5,900 to 6,100. The gauge closed at 5,916.93 Thursday.
“Our constructive equity outlook is not an all clear for the riskiest areas of the markets,” the team wrote, emphasizing preference from US large- and mid-cap companies.
Equity gains will likely get harder from these elevated levels, so the relatively low cost of volatility hedges on offer right now hands investors an opportunity to build a defense against summer volatility.
“While we continue to expect a range of trade agreements to be reached to sustain the tariff rate at roughly the level during the pause period, ongoing uncertainty could trigger further bouts of market volatility,” said Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management.
Meantime, tax-bill discussions in Congress show the US “appears unwilling” to rein in its fiscal deficit, while foreigners are less inclined to finance it, creating a “major problem” for the dollar and the bond market, said George Saravelos, Deutsche Bank’s global head of currency strategy.
“Running a wider fiscal deficit requires foreigners to buy an ever-expanding amount of US Treasuries and an ongoing rise of America’s foreign liabilities,” he wrote. “This we believe is no longer sustainable.”
The dollar’s descent is elevating the price of hedging currency trades around the world, breaking up a long-standing market conviction that costs tend to come down when the greenback weakens.
The correlation between the dollar and a widely-watched gauge of volatility in Group-of-10 currencies fell to the lowest level in seven years this week. For most of the past 15 years that correlation was positive.
Corporate Highlights:
• Walmart Inc. delivered another quarter of solid sales and earnings growth, but cautioned that tariffs and increasing economic turbulence means even the world’s largest retailer expects to raise prices.

Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.

Welcome to Episode #422 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.
Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.
This week, Tracey is joined by Jeremy Mullin, the editor of Zacks Commodity Innovators, to discuss if investors should invest in Bitcoin or gold.
Obviously, investors can buy Bitcoin or gold directly. But what if you want to buy it through a stock or an ETF? Tracey and Jeremy looked at a couple of different investments.
Should you dive in?
MicroStrategy is a company that is in the business of owning Bitcoin. It doesn’t even have a Zacks Rank anymore as it has no analyst coverage.
But because Bitcoin is up this year, so is MicroStrategy’s stock. Shares of MicroStrategy have jumped 304% year-to-date.
Is MicroStrategy an easy way to own Bitcoin?
If being long MicroStrategy isn’t enough for you, maybe buying the 2X long ETF is for you? Launched in Sep 2024, the MSTU has already attracted $90 million in assets.
MSTU is up 92% in the last month but a reminder, the 2x long, and short, ETFs are not designed to buy and hold. They’re designed to be traded.
But if that’s what you’re looking for, the MSTU may be the right play for you.
Forget looking through your jewelry box for those old gold rings and necklaces. Investors can play gold by buying the Gold ETF, the GLD. It has been around two decades and GLD has pulled in $73 billion in assets.
Shares of GLD will trade with the price of gold. It shouldn’t be surprising, with gold hitting new all-time highs, that GLD is too. GLD is up 32.5% year-to-date. Not too shabby.
Is it time to buy gold through GLD?
Newmont is a large cap gold mining company. It recently reported earnings. It’s reported disappointed the Street. Shares of Newmont fell 16% on the news.
Year-to-date, Newmont is up just 16.8% versus gold up 32.5%. It did raise its share buyback program to $3 billion from $1 billion. Newmont also pays a dividend yielding 2.1%.
Is Newmont’s buyback enough to appease shareholders?
Franco-Nevada is a Canadian gold-focused royalty and streaming company. In the second quarter, precious metals were 74.2% of revenue with 60.3% in gold. Franco-Nevada also has iron ore and energy in its portfolio.
Year-to-date shares of Franco-Nevada have gained 22.7%. It hasn’t reported earnings yet but will report third quarter results on Nov 6, 2024. Franco-Nevada pays a dividend, yielding 1.1%.
Should a royalty and streaming company like Franco-Nevada be on your gold short list?
Tune into this week’s video podcast to find out.

56381,2021-11-16 08:43:13,Is The Bitcoin Creator Going To Be Revealed? A $61 Billion Question,"Soon, the world may learn who is the retailBitcoincreator, currently known under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.
In Florida, a family of a dead man is suing his former business partner over the assets of the partnership. It’s not a usual case, as the assets in question include 1 million Bitcoins, which are worth about $61 billion today.
The family of David Kleiman is suing Craig Wright, who has been arguing that he created Bitcoin. Mr. Wright dropped his claims in 2016 after facing strong criticism, but has since returned to his original story and argued that he was the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto.
Mr. Kleiman died in 2013. His family claims that Kleiman and Wright created Bitcoin together. Therefore, Mr. Kleiman’s family should have the right to 50% of the 1 million Bitcoins.
Anyone who argues that he is Satoshi Nakamoto should have the private key and show that he can move the Bitcoins in question. The trial will find out whether Mr. Wright created Bitcoin or his claims were false. If the trial finds that neither Mr. Kleiman nor Mr. Wright were the creators of the world’s first cryptocurrency, the crypto world will remain in the dark about the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.
Bitcoin gained strong downside momentum after it managed to settle below the 20 EMA at $63,000. Currently, Bitcoin is trying to get to the test of the $60,000 level.
In case Bitcoin gets below $60,000, it will head towards the 50 EMA at $59,100. A successful test of the support at the 50 EMA will open the way to the test of the next support level which is located at $57,700.
On the upside, the nearest resistance level for Bitcoin is located at $62,000. If Bitcoin manages to climb back above this level, it will head towards the 20 EMA at $63,000. A move above the 20 EMA will push Bitcoin towards the next resistance level at $63,500.

Nonetheless, traders remained cautious after U.S. President Joe Biden warned that more than 150,000 Russian troops were still in a “threatening position”.
At 15:00 GMT, March U.S. Dollar Index futures are trading 95.940, down 0.053 or -0.06%. TheInvesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund ETF (UUP)is trading $25.66, down $0.03 or -0.12%.
In economic news, consumer spending bounced back sharply in January as rising inflation and a post-holiday surge kept cash registers ringing, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.Retail salesfor the month rose 3.8%, much better than the 2.1% Dow Jones estimate.
Theminutes from the Fed’s January meetingwill be released later today at 19:00 GMT. Traders are expecting a hawkish tone with long-standing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise rates starting in March.
The main trend is up according to the daily swing chart. A trade through 97.440 will signal a resumption of the uptrend. A move through 95.145 will change the main trend to down.
The minor range is 95.145 to 96.430. The index is currently trading on the strong side of its pivot at 95.790, making it support. This level stopped the selling earlier today.
The short-term range is 97.440 to 95.145. Its retracement zone at 96.295 to 96.565 is resistance. It stopped the buying at 96.43 on Monday.
The main support zone is 95.320 – 94.820. It stopped the selling at 95.145 on February 4.
The direction of the March U.S. Dollar Index into the close on Wednesday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to 95.790.
A sustained move over 95.790 will indicate the presence of buyers. If this creates enough upside momentum then look for a surge into 96.295. Sellers could come in on the first test of this area, but look for an acceleration to the upside if buyers can take out 96.565.
A sustained move under 95.785 will be a sign of weakness. This could trigger a sharp break into 95.320 to 94.820. This area has to hold or the dollar could collapse.

61598,2022-06-29 10:33:07,5 Things to Know in Crypto Today,"• Cryptocurrency prices are under pressure on Wednesday after recent US/Eurozone data highlights growing recession risks as consumer confidence tumbles.
• Bitcoin was last trading just above the key $20K mark and Ethereum around $1,130.
• “Blockchain technology and the digital asset ecosystem are here to stay”, concluded BofA in a report released on Tuesday.
Ugly consumer confidence data out of both the US and Eurozone in the past few days has brought recession fears back into investor focus at a time when central bankers continue to sound very hawkish and as inflation remains very high. The US Conference Board’s measure of US Consumer Confidence in June fell to its weakest since early 2021, but Fed policymakers have been doubling down this week on the need for a continued rapid pace of rate hikes to tackle rampant US inflation.
US Core PCE inflation figures out on Thursday will be in focus next following remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the ECB’s annual Sintra event later on Wednesday. Speaking of the ECB, policymakers there are also doubling down on the need for significant monetary tightening amid scorching inflation rates. Preliminary June inflation estimates out of Spain were just released and saw the YoY headline hit a new record high of 10%.
Unsurprisingly, against this backdrop, risk assets have once again come under pressure. The S&P 500 dropped around 2.0% on Tuesday and is trading slightly in the red on Wednesday as investors question whether stock valuations have sufficiently taken into account recession risks. This has weighed on crypto. Total cryptocurrency market cap was last around $880 billion, on course to have fallen for a fourth day in a row and now about 9.0% below last week’s highs.
The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capBitcoinwas last trading slightly above the psychologically important $20,000 level and down about 4.5% in the last 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap.Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, was last trading lower by just over 7.0% in the last 24 hours in the $1,130s per token.
Most other major altcoins are experiencing losses of a similar magnitude. Binance’sBNBwas last down about 7.5% near-$220 per token, while Cardano’sADA, Ripple’sXRP, Solana’sSOL,Dogecoinand Polkadot’sDOTwere each down between 3-9%.
The native token on the Chainlink blockchainLINKspiked higher on Tuesday after popular retail trading/investing platform Robinhood announced that it had listed the token. Shortly after the listing, LINK/USD was trading as much as 10% higher on the day in the $7.25 per token area.
However, Chainlink was unable to hold onto these gains amid broader selling pressure in crypto markets. LINK/USD ended Tuesday’s session around $6.30 and with losses of nearly 4%, though has since bounced about 2.5% on Wednesday to trade closer to $6.50 once again.
That leaves Chainlink near the mid-point of the $5.50-$7.50ish ranges that have been in play since mid-June. The cryptocurrency is currently on course to end the month with losses of about 15% and the quarter with losses of over 60%.
Conversations with 160 clients who attended Bank of America (BofA)’s “Web3 & Digital Assets Day” conference last week have revealed that “blockchain technology and the digital asset ecosystem are here to stay”, BofA said in a report released on Tuesday. The report said that many survey participants were of the opinion that crypto downturns are “likely healthy for the ecosystem’s development over the long term”.
“Client engagement continues to grow and focus remains on the rapid development and disruptive nature of blockchain technology, despite falling token prices and headlines suggesting the ecosystem’s demise has arrived,” BofA said in the report.
Elsewhere, a separate report released earlier this week by investment firm Alto revealed that more Millenials are investing in crypto than mutual funds, with the proportion of those investing in crypto now nearly as high as stocks. The report highlighted that most millennials either already own digital assets, or are considering buying them, though that economic difficulties are making investment challenging.
“In a world of conspicuous consumption, soaring living costs, and mounting student loan debt, millennials find it difficult to invest for the future because they are struggling to afford the present,” Alto CEO Eric Satz said.
75% of Marathon Digital Holdings Bitcoin mining capability has been knocked offline since a storm hit the town of Hardin, Montana on 11 June. According to a statement issued by the Bitcoin mining company on Tuesday, the storm damaged the power generating facilities that supply mining operations. “Initial electrical tests have found that the majority of the Company’s miners were not materially damaged by the storm,” the company said.
In further mining-related news, Bitcoin mining, hosting and brokerage service provider Compass Mining has seen both its CEO and CFO resign, according to an email sent out to customers on Tuesday. The resignations come after Dynamics Mining last week terminated its contract to host Compass Mining rigs, accusing them of owing $600,000 in unpaid bills.
Looking through the noise, according to Blockchain.com, the Bitcoin network’s hashrate is currently around 208 million terahashes per second (th/s). That’s down from a record high above 230 million th/s seen earlier this month, but still very strong by historical comparison. This time last year, for example, the network’s hashrate was about half of that.
Major global crypto exchange Huobi on Tuesday confirmed leaked reports from earlier in the week that it is going to lay off 30% of its staff amid a drop in revenue associated with the loss of Chinese users since the crypto ban there. This is in fitting with the broader trend of crypto firms letting go of employees as the industry contracts. Other high-profile firms to have let go of workers includeCoinbase, Crypto.com, Gemini and Bitpanda.
But crypto exchange OKX is bucking the trend. It announced on Tuesday that it wants to increase its headcount by 30% to around 5,000 as it becomes more “internationalized”. Only a few other crypto exchanges have been moving to expand amid the current downturn (Binance and FTX being the most notable).

56090,2021-09-01 22:58:39,Twitter Is Reportedly Testing Tipping In Bitcoin Feature,"Twitter Inc.(NYSE:TWTR) is now testing Lightning Network-poweredBitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) tipping service.
What Happened:According to a MacRumorsreport, Twitter's latest beta update allows to send Bitcoin tips to content creators through a Lightning Network integration in the ""Tip Jar"" feature added in May. While the option is not yet available to beta users, unused code suggests that the rollout will happen soon.
When the Twitter Tip Jar was first created, it supported Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon,PayPal Holdings Inc.(NASDAQ:PYPL), and Venmo as payment methods linked to their profile — soon, a Bitcoin option is expected to roll out as well.
Why It's Important:The report follows the firm's CEO Jack Dorseystatementto investors in late July that Bitcoin is important to the company and that it was indeed going to be integrated into the Tip Jar.
The code included in the latest Twitter beta update reveals that a dedicated tutorial will guide users interested in using the Bitcoin Lightning Network integration and non-custodial Bitcoin wallets.
Twitter cites Strike, Blue Wallet, and Wallet of Satoshi as examples of custodial wallets and Muun, Breez, Phoenix, and Zap as non-custodial options.

9860,2013-09-17 20:00:33,Bitcoin ETF Backers Winklevoss Twins Make Case for Digital Currency,"Bitcoins, the digital currency, are the best performing asset of 2013, even after a quick boom-and-bust cycle earlier this year. Exchange traded fund investors may soon be able to gain exposure to the strengthening currency as the Winklevoss twins push for wider awareness.
“An ETF can potentially make it successful for mainstream investors,” said Cameron Winklevoss, reports Brendan Conway forBarron’s.
Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss at the Value Investing Congress in New York explained that investors who purchase Bitcoins directly will have to deal with “pain points and friction.” The brothers have filed to launch an exchange traded product backed by bitcoins. It’s not clear whether the SEC will give the bitcoin ETF clearance to list. [Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF: Crazy, or Crazy Like a Fox?]
“Buying Bitcoin today, it’s sort of a scary proposition. You store it on a USB stick, [you have to be somewhat] technically savvy … [If you're transacting in] large amounts of money, there’s no real insurance aspect,” Cameron Winklevoss said.
On the other hand, the ETF investment vehicle helps mitigate the risks and hassle of buying the coins directly.
“An ETF can help solve the purchasing friction in terms of security. It can offload that to the ETF… Storing Bitcoin takes expertise [and] accessibility. …. It’s similar to how [people] can’t buy gold bars so they instead buy an ETF,” he added, comparing the structure to something similar to physically backed precious metal ETFs, according to the Barron’s report.
What do we know about Bitcoins?
• Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym for a person or persons unknown who wrote the technical specifications that serve as the system’s base code, Nicholas Colas, Chief Market Strategist at ConvergEx, said in a research note.
• Bitcoin records, or the “block chain,” resides on thousands of servers around the world. Every ten minutes, the whole system updates records of recent transactions. “No one government, or even 100 governments, can ‘shut down’ bitcoin or establish uniform regulations for the currency,” Colas added.
• Creating, or “mining,” bitcoins requires time and money. Cryptographic puzzles need to be solved during a 10 minute window and the answer has to be delivered to everyone else int eh system. If the task is done, you receive 25 new bitcoins. “The bitcoin ecosystem is dominated by very proficient computer programmers and hardware designers, but even as they improve the speed and efficiency of their servers the universe of available bitcoins still only grows by 25 units every 10 minutes,” Colas said.
• Many view bitcoins as a disruptive currency since a user can transfer the money anywhere without paying wire or banking fees. “The bitcoin ecosystem is more efficient than the currency global banking system for money transfers since the process of managing the block chain incentivizes bitcoin miners to keep the system operating, rather than the banking system’s user fees,” Colas said.
Bitcoins started the year at $13.55 and traded at $141 at last check Tuesday, a 940% increase year-to-date. The currency experienced a boom-and-bust in April where the Bitcoin surged to $266 and plunged to as low as $70.80 in a few days. [Is a Bitcoin ETF Next?]
Basic demand and supply fundamentals favor the asset.
“Volume trends were fairly consistent through the year, so the increase in pricecame from steady demand and little incremental supply from sellers,” Colas said.
The future of a viable ETF option will depend on the bitcoin itself. If more accept the asset as real currency alternative, the more likely an ETF will be able to come out. [Bitcoin ETF Faces Doubts Within Industry: Report]

67050,2022-05-16 20:05:00,Stronghold Digital Mining Reports First Quarter 2022 Results and Provides Operational Update,"NEW YORK, May 16, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --Stronghold Digital Mining, Inc.(Nasdaq: SDIG) (“Stronghold,” or the “Company”)today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2022 and provided an operational update.
First Quarter 2022 and Recent Operational and Financial Highlights
• Removed approximately 279,000 tons of coal refuse and returned approximately 179,000 tons of beneficial use ash to waste coal sites during the first quarter of 2022, facilitating the remediation of these sites.
• On May 15, 2022, the Company issued approximately $33.8 million aggregate principal notes (the “Notes”) bearing a coupon of 10.0% and a maturity date of May 15, 2024, plus approximately 6.3 million warrants, with a strike price of $2.50, to certain investors. The Notes convert to preferred equity bearing an 8.0% coupon if the market capitalization exceeds $400 million based on the 20-day VWAP price and there are 60 million shares outstanding or greater as of September 30, 2022. If those tests are not met as of September 30, 2022, the security remains a note bearing 10% coupon plus quarterly note amortization of the greater of 8% of revenue or $5.4 million. The Notes can be repaid by the Company at any time without prepayment penalty.
• As of May 12, 2022, and pro forma for the issuance of the Notes and miner sales, which were executed after May 12, 2022, Stronghold had approximately $47 million of cash & equivalents plus unrestricted BTC holdings and more than $60 million of liquidity. These figures include $27 million of cash proceeds from the issuance of the Notes and approximately $10 million of cash proceeds from miner sales.
• Mined 438 Bitcoin during the first quarter of 2022, including 198 in March 2022; mined over 100 Bitcoin in first 13 days of May.
• Averaged hash rate of 0.9 exahash per second (“EH/s”) in the first quarter of 2022.
• As of March 31, 2022, Stronghold had received a total of approximately 25,900 miners with total hash rate capacity of approximately 2.4 EH/s. As of May 12, 2022, the Company had received approximately 32,800 miners with total hash rate capacity of approximately 3.0 EH/s.
• Reiterating guidance to exit 2022 with 4.1 EH/s of installed hash rate capacity, which excludes all potential future deliveries of MinerVa miners. Note that this guidance is unaffected by recent miner sales related to our miner fleet optimization initiative.
Management Commentary
“Since we reported FY 2021 earnings on March 29, 2022, we believe that we have made significant progress on enhancing our operations, and we are executing on our goal of exceeding 4 EH/s by the end of the year,” said Greg Beard, co-chairman and chief executive officer of Stronghold. “Earlier in the year, Stronghold chose to de-emphasize growth to focus on capital discipline and financial flexibility, and recent operational and financial initiatives, including our recent issuance of the Notes, have helped de-risk our funding needs, despite recent volatility in cryptocurrency markets.”
“Furthermore, we believe that our vertically integrated business model provides us with differentiated downside protection that is misunderstood by the market. We built Stronghold with the expectation that volatility in the cryptocurrency markets could, at times, stress full-cycle returns throughout the industry. Owning our power assets, which sell power into the PJM grid, allows us to pivot to sell power opportunistically during periods when power prices are more favorable than Bitcoin mining economics. This powerful option has never been more valuable, and we are in the process of ensuring that our plants and datacenters have the ability to optimize for profitability during periods of weak Bitcoin prices and strong power prices.”
Cryptocurrency Mining Update
During the first quarter of 2022, Stronghold mined approximately 438 Bitcoin. As of March 31, 2022, we had received approximately 25,900 miners with total hash rate capacity of approximately 2.4 EH/s. For the first quarter of 2022, Stronghold averaged a hash rate of approximately 0.9 EH/s, in line with previously announced guidance.
On April 20, 2022, switchgear failed at the datacenter at the Panther Creek power plant (the “Panther Creek Plant”), resulting in 10 days of downtime in cryptocurrency mining, during which time the Company instead sold power to the grid. Prior to the switchgear failure, the datacenter at the Panther Creek Plant was operating at approximately 1.2 EH/s. Normal mining operations resumed on April 30, 2022, and Stronghold estimates the lost mining associated with the outage to be approximately 55 Bitcoin, or approximately $2.2 million, which was partially mitigated by energy revenue of $0.8 million, resulting in a net impact of negative $1.4 million. Stronghold has assessed critical and long-lead-time equipment and is actively procuring additional parts, which will be held in inventory to mitigate the length and impact of any future outages.
As of May 12, 2022, the Company had received approximately 32,800 miners with total hash rate capacity of approximately 3.0 EH/s, of which approximately 24,000 miners, with hash rate capacity of approximately 2.3 EH/s, were installed and operational. As of May 12, 2022, Stronghold has entered into purchase agreements for approximately 12,000 additional miners with total hash rate capacity of approximately 1.2 EH/s, excluding potential future deliveries of MinerVa miners. The Company continues to have active and frequent conversations with MinerVa regarding future deliveries or other methods of extracting the value contractually owed to Stronghold. The Company does not have sufficient information from MinerVa to provide an update or a timeline on future deliveries, or if the Company can expect any future deliveries. MinerVa miners represent approximately 11% of Stronghold’s current hash rate capacity and are expected to represent less than 6% of installed hash rate capacity by year end 2022.
Operations associated with the Company’s profit-sharing arrangement at the Scrubgrass power plant (the “Scrubgrass Plant”) are also progressing. On March 29, 2022, only four of 24 datacenter containers had been commissioned under the arrangement, but, as of May 12, 2022, 10 additional datacenter containers had been commissioned, with an additional 10 datacenter containers expected to be commissioned within the next two months.
As of March 31, 2022 and May 12, 2022, Stronghold held on its balance sheet approximately 369 Bitcoin and approximately 285 Bitcoin, respectively.
Power Assets Update
Stronghold owns and operates approximately 165 MW of power generation capacity through its Scrubgrass Plant and its Panther Creek Plant, both coal refuse reclamation-to-energy facilities located in Pennsylvania. These plants generate power from coal refuse, which is a waste byproduct of legacy coal mining operations. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has designated coal refuse as a Tier II Alternative Energy Source, making the facilities eligible to earn renewable energy credits.
Stronghold’s vertically integrated business model, which includes ownership of power assets, provides differentiated opportunities to create value, including during periods of higher power prices or lower Bitcoin prices. Since March 30, 2022, average forward power prices for June 2022 to May 2023, in the markets into which the Company sells power, have increased by nearly 70%, while Bitcoin prices have decreased more than 35% over the same time frame. This divergence has created opportunities for Stronghold to potentially generate more value selling power to the grid rather than powering its Bitcoin operations during certain timeframes. The Company is consistently evaluating the optimal strategy, which may include selling power to the grid during hours when on-peak power prices are in effect but remains committed to its Bitcoin mining operations.
As discussed in the Company’s fourth quarter earnings release, the Scrubgrass Plant encountered greater-than-anticipated downtime and operated at a lower utilization than expected during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022. Stronghold has been implementing upgrades to improve utilization, and average output increased by more than 20% in April 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2022. The upgrades remain on track to be completed by early in the second half of 2022, at which point uptime and utilization are expected to return to normalized levels.
The Company continues to evaluate opportunities to acquire additional power generation assets, including a coal refuse reclamation facility with 112 MW of power generation capacity that has been under a non-binding letter of intent to purchase since 2021.
First Quarter 2022 Financial Results
Revenues in the first quarter of 2022 increased 656% to $28.7 million compared to $3.8 million in the same quarter a year ago. The increase is primarily attributable to higher energy generation and cryptocurrency mining revenues.
Operating expenses in the first quarter of 2022 increased 1,074% to $58.3 million compared to $5.0 million in the same quarter a year ago. The increase is attributable to a $12.2 million non-cash impairment on equipment deposits for MinerVa miners, an $11.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization from deploying additional miners and transformers, a $10.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses as the Company continues to scale operations, a $9.1 million increase in operations and maintenance expense primarily driven by the additional Panther Creek plant and one-time plant upgrades at Scrubgrass, a $7.2 million increase in fuel expenses driven by higher power generation and $2.5 million of non-cash impairment costs attributable to the declines in the price of Bitcoin.
Net loss for the first quarter of 2022 was ($32.3) million compared to a net loss of ($0.2) million for the same quarter a year ago.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2022 was $3.8 million, compared to a loss of ($0.3) million for the same quarter a year ago (see reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures).
Net cash used by operating activities in the first quarter of 2022 was ($2.5) million compared to $3.0 million of net cash provided by operating activities in the same quarter a year ago.
Stronghold ended the quarter with approximately $25.5 million in cash, $5.1 million in unrestricted digital currencies and approximately $110.8 million in debt.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Stronghold ended the first quarter of 2022 with total liquidity of approximately $48.6 million, comprising approximately $25.5 million in cash, approximately $5.1 million in unrestricted digital currencies and approximately $18.0 million in availability under its existing equipment financing agreements.
Subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2022, the Company raised $27.0 million from certain investors through the issuance of the Notes and sold Bitcoin miners with hash rate capacity of approximately 332 PH/s for approximately $16.9 million. Approximately $9.9 million of cash and approximately $7.0mm reduction of future 2022 capital expenditures.
As of May 12, 2022, and pro forma for the issuance of the Notes and the sales of Bitcoin miners, total liquidity was approximately $61 million, including cash, unrestricted digital currencies and availability under existing financing agreements.
Stronghold believes its liquidity position, combined with expected operating cash flow, will be sufficient to meet all existing commitments and fund operations. The Company also believes that incremental liquidity can be created through proceeds related to Bitcoin miner fleet management and optimization, including potential miner sales and through additional equipment financing agreements, if necessary.

Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis press release and our related earnings call contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, as a measure of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted by the removal of one-time transaction costs, impairment of digital currencies, realized gains and losses on the sale of long-term assets, expenses related to stock-based compensation, gains or losses on derivative contracts, gain on extinguishment of debt, realized gain or loss on sale of digital currencies, waste coal credits, commission on sale of ash, or changes in fair value of warrant liabilities in the period presented. See reconciliation below.
Our board of directors and management team use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because they believe it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense and income), asset base (such as depreciation, amortization, impairment, and realized gains and losses on sale of long-term assets) and other items (such as one-time transaction costs, expenses related to stock-based compensation, and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts) that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure will provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing our financial performance and results of operations across reporting periods by excluding items we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements furnished in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.

46647,2020-05-02 19:36:55,"The Week In Cannabis: Stocks Back Down, New Corporate Shakeups, M&A, And Policy Moves Around The World","Despite starting the week rallying, likely on the back of substantial short covering , cannabis stocks were back in the red this week, with all major ETFs closing the week lower than they had started it. These were their respective losses: ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSE: MJ ): 2.94%. AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF (NYSE: YOLO ): 1.3%. Cannabis ETF (NYSE: THCX ): 2.92%. Amplify Seymour Cannabis ETF (NYSE: CNBS ): 3.3%. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ) closed the period down 0.08%. The big story this week was the resignation of Hadley Ford, CEO of iAnthus Capital Holdings (CSE: IAN) (OTC: ITHUF ). The New York-based company announced its decision to replace Ford with Randy Maslow, who now serves as interim CEO, following a review conducted by a special committee of independent directors, which determined that Ford had “misused iAnthus' resources to his benefit.” Find all the details of this story on Benzinga. “Hadley Ford resigning from iAnthus this week was a sad turn of events. It came about after an online media company exposed some debt issues, which the company vehemently denied,"" Debra Borchardt, CEO of Green Market Report, told Benzinga. “Upon investigation, the company confirmed two of the three allegations. If a company can't protect its shareholders, it's up to the media to do so. Disclosure is always the best policy, even if the news is less than great.” Find our cannabis, hemp and psychedelics news in Spanish on El Planteo . Another big news item this week came out of Hightimes Holding Corp., which said it would acquire up to 13 California dispensaries from Harvest Health & Recreation (CSE: HARV) (OTC: HRVSF ) for $80 million. In other positive news, Santa Clara County, California, prosecutors are set to vacate or lessen more than 11,500 convictions for cannabis violations, after revising the list sent by the California Department of Justice. Mexican Sen. Julio Ramón Menchaca Salaza came out with strong declarations in support of legalizing recreational cannabis as a way to make up for some of the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. “We have this opportunity and we are going to take advantage of it,"" Salaza said. The proposed bill would allow adults over 18 to possess and cultivate marijuana for personal use. Individuals could grow up to 20 registered plants as long as the total yield doesn’t exceed 480 grams per year. Medical patients could also apply to cultivate more than 20 plants. Personal possession would be capped at 28 grams, but possession of up to 200 grams would be decriminalized. Story continues In Michigan, the Supreme Court unanimously decided that municipalities can regulate and restrict where caregivers grow their cannabis for medical consumption. Previously, the Michigan Court of Appeals had ruled that the Medical Marijuana Act trumped, rather than complemented, local zoning restrictions. And, in New Zealand, a legal reform on cannabis was proposed. It will be voted on in a national referendum, along with the general elections and referendum on Euthanasia. This reform promises to lead the international legalization movement by proposing a series of highly progressive issues. In general terms, it will be very similar to the Canadian reform, although it will have an extremely protectionist tinge on native and more vulnerable communities. Market shares would be reserved for micro-cultivators, businesses led by indigenous people would be prioritized and consumption areas would be enabled.

This interest stems from the sheer size of tv audiences that tune into live televised sporting events. As exchanges look to market their platforms at sporting events, sporting events are also embracing the crypto space.
While Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptos, such as Ethereum (ETH) continue to draw investor interest, interest inNon-Fungible Tokens, more commonly referred to as NFTs, has also been on the rise.
NFTs are both individual and unique. The key characteristic, therefore, is that they cannot be copied or duplicated.This very attribute has made NFTs particularly popular within the world of sport.
Late last year, the English Premier League converged with the NFT space.News hit the wiresof the Premier League considering a partnership with a digital collectibles platform. A partnership could be particularly lucrative when considering the global following of teams such as Liverpool and Manchester United.
In the U.S, sporting franchises and NFTs have also partnered. In September 2021, the NFL, the NFL Players Association, and Dapper Labsannounceda partnership “to create exclusive digital video highlight NFTs for NFL fans”. For the NBA, the link with NFTs has been a successful and a lucrative one.NBA Top Shotis an NFT marketplace, where fans can buy and sell, and trade NBA moments. The NBA Top Shot marketplace, is a joint venture between the NBA, NBPA, and Dapper Labs that began in 2019.
When considering the level of interest in both the NBA and the NFL NFTs, it’s not surprising that other franchises are exploring the NFT space.
Overnight,news hit the wiresof the Australian Open planning to become the first tennis grand slam tournament to enter the metaverse. The Australian Open is the first of 4 grand slam tennis tournaments that take place each year. First held in 1905, the tournament is reportedly the highest attended. In 2020, total attendance hit an ATH 812,174.
As part of the initiative, the Australian open reportedly plans to release 6,776 Art Balls NFTs via its newly launched platformThe AO Art Ball. The Australian tennis tournament will also “steam a virtual tennis tournament in Decentraland”. The NFTs will be minted on Ethereum (ETH).
The sale begins on 10thJanuary ahead of the 17thJanuary start to the tournament.

90245,2025-02-28 21:43:37,"Why KULR Technology Group, Inc. (KULR) is Plunging So Far in 2025","We recently compiled a list of theWhy These 15 AI Stocks Are Plunging So Far in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where KULR Technology Group, Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:KULR) stands against the other AI stocks.
Investors have been turning sour on the AI industry. Many have expected AI stocks to decline for the past two years, but that did not turn out to be the case and AI companies proved bears wrong in each of the past eight or so quarters.
Microsoft has canceled its data center contracts and Trump’s tariff plans are increasingly complicating the AI narrative, especially for semiconductor companies that derive a good portion of their revenue from China.
Perhaps AI could prove the bears wrong again, but considering even Nvidia’s recent earnings beat failed to overpower the cautiousness investors now have about AI, it is worth looking into some bearish arguments.
A good way to do that is by looking into AI stocks that have corrected the most so far this year. The AI industry is quite broad and you’ll be able to gain useful insight into some major AI sectors and their challengers if you look into why these stocks have been declining.
For this article, I screened the worst-performing AI stocks year-to-date. Stocks that I have covered recently will be excluded from this list.
I will also mention the number of hedge fund investors in these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 6
KULR Technology Group Inc (NYSEAMERICAN:KULR) is a thermal management company.
The stock is down significantly so far in 2025 as there has been a class action lawsuit alleging insider trading. The company has also gotten deeply involved in Bitcoin and has increased its BTC holdings to $60 million. This is 90% of cash reserves and the recent BTC decline has dragged down the stock.
Moreover, KULR Technology Group Inc (NYSEAMERICAN:KULR) filed for an automatic mixed securities shelf in January. There are also reports of challenges in the company’s thermal management tech.
On top of that, the cautiousness in both the broader AI industry and the crypto industry has caused twice the bearishness.
The consensus price target of $1 implies 32.43% downside.
KULR Technology Group Inc (NYSEAMERICAN:KULR) is down 58.73% year-to-date.
Overall KULRranks 1ston our list of the AI stocks that are plunging so far in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of KULR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KULR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about thecheapest AI stock.

90541,2024-08-15 14:06:59,Stablecoin Supply Growth Isn't Eating Into Crypto Market Share: JPMorgan,"• Stablecoin growth is a reflection of an increase in total crypto market cap following gains in bitcoin and ether this year, the report said.
• The bank noted that stablecoin market share as a percentage of the total crypto market cap is little changed.
• The launch of new products and regulatory clarity in Europe have helped attract investors to the stablecoin space, JPMorgan said.
Stablecoin supply has beengrowingin U.S. dollar terms, but the expansion doesn't mean it's taking over crypto market share; rather, it is mainly an indication of the increase in total digital asset market cap, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Wednesday.
Astablecoinis a type of cryptocurrency that's normally pegged to the U.S. dollar, though some other currencies and assets such as gold are also used.
There has been ""little change in the stablecoin market share as a percentage of total crypto crypto market cap,"" analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.
The bank noted that total stablecoin market cap has rebounded to $165 billion, nearing the previous high of $180 billion, which was witnessed before theTerra/Luna collapse.
There are a number of reasons for this stablecoin market growth.
The large gains in prices of bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} this year have triggered an increase in crypto market cap which has led to growth in the supply of stablecoins as these tokens ""serve as collateral in crypto lending/borrowing and other crypto transactions,"" the report said.
Investors have been increasingly using stablecoins to access the crypto markets following the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. in January, the bank noted. These cryptocurrencies have also seen more demand from thetraditional financeworld.
This year has seen the emergence of new stablecoin issuers and products such as Ethena's USDe, the bank said, which has also contributed to growth.
Regulatory clarity in Europe, with the introduction of the Markets in Crypto-Assets(MiCA)legislation on July 1, has attracted investors to the stablecoin space, the report added.

10844,2017-12-28 15:30:00,"Why 2017 Was a Year to Forget for Coeur Mining, Inc.","Investors in Coeur Mining (NYSE: CDE) wanted to see the value of their investments in the gold and silver miner grow with rising precious metal prices in 2017, but that was not to be. Coeur is capping the year with double-digit percentage losses -- roughly 18% as of this writing -- even as shares of peer Pan American Silver (NASDAQ: PAAS) are in the green this year. Among Coeur's closest peers, only Hecla Mining (NYSE: HL) fared worse this year for company-specific reasons . Otherwise, Coeur is among the worst-performing stocks in the silver mining industry for 2017. Ironically, fiscal 2017 is set to be a record production year for Coeur and its best cash flow year since 2012, thanks in part to a renewed gold and silver streaming agreement with one of the largest precious-metals streaming companies, Franco-Nevada Corp. (NYSE: FNV) . The market's ire, therefore, might be misplaced, which means while 2017 was a year to forget for Coeur investors, it wasn't quite so for the company that's stepping into 2018 with strong tailwinds. 2017: The hits and misses Expectations ran high after Coeur's remarkable turnaround in 2016, when it posted a net profit of $55.4 million versus a loss of $367.2 million in fiscal 2015. CEO Mitchell J. Krebs sounded optimistic about 2017 during the company's fiscal 2016 earnings release, saying, ""Coeur has entered 2017 well-positioned to continue delivering high-quality growth through ongoing initiatives at our Palmarejo, Kensington, and Rochester operations."" A metallic brick with numerical 7 etched on it lying beside four bricks with 2018 etched on them. Image source: Getty Images. Krebs was right: Coeur didn't stop growing. Its silver equivalent ounces (SEOs) production is set to rise by roughly 6.5% at the midpoint in fiscal 2017 -- far ahead of rival Pan American's muted growth estimates . As for Coeur's ongoing projects, expansions at the Kensington (Alaska) and Rochester (Nevada) mines are on track, while that at Palmarejo (Mexico) -- Coeur's largest multiple-mine complex -- is way ahead of schedule. As a result, the company's SEOs jumped 10% year over year during the third quarter. Story continues Palmarejo also played a key role in driving Coeur's revenue up 10% during the nine months ended Sept. 30, thanks to the miner's agreement with Franco-Nevada, which was renewed in late 2016. Franco-Nevada agreed to buy 50% of the gold produced from Palmarejo at $800 per ounce, which is nearly double the amount it was paying Coeur under the old streaming agreement. (Franco-Nevada is a precious-metals streaming and royalty company that buys metals from mining companies like Coeur in exchange for up-front funding.) A bird's eye view of Coeur's Silvertip mine. Coeur Mining's Silvertip mine. Image source: Coeur Mining. This year, Coeur also acquired the Silvertip mine, in British Columbia, for $200 million. The mine is expected to produce an average of 10 million SEOs annually, which is nearly 25% of Coeur's estimated 2017 production. Unfortunately, losses threw a monkey wrench into investors' hopes as uncontrollable factors, such as record rainfall in Nevada and drought in Bolivia, drove Coeur's operating costs higher. As a result, Coeur had to increase its all-in sustaining cost (AISC) guidance by $0.25 per SEO at the midpoint to $15.75-$16.25 per SEO for the full year. That didn't go down well with investors, especially since peers like Pan American Silver and First Majestic Silver are successfully cutting costs to boost margins. All's not lost, though: Coeur could make a strong comeback in 2018. 2018: A turnaround year for Coeur? Silvertip is a significant addition to Coeur's asset base. Aside from boasting strong production potential, Silvertip is supposed to have AISC as low as $10.50-$11.50 per SEO at full capacity. Silvertip is already a producing mine, and Coeur is currently developing it further to recommence commercial production by the first quarter of 2018 and add to Coeur's earnings. Meanwhile, higher ore grades from Palmarejo and Kensington should further boost production and cash flow in 2018. Speaking of cash flow, Coeur remained free-cash-flow positive despite losses and higher capital expenditure during the trailing 12 months. In fact, Coeur was FCF positive in four out of the past five years, which is an impressive streak given how volatile the precious-metals markets can be. 2017 was a challenging year for Coeur, but the miner didn't fluster. Coeur's growth moves, production profile, and financial standing point at a strong 2018. I have a feeling the silver stock's downward trend could reverse, making it a year to remember for investors.

1384,2018-09-18 16:50:55,Battle of the Privacycoins: Verge Offers Little Privacy and Nothing Unique,"Based on blockchain technology, most cryptocurrencies have an open and public ledger. While this is required for these systems to work, it comes with a significant downside: Privacy is often quite limited. Government agencies, analytics companies and other interested parties — let’s call them “spies” — have ways to analyze the public blockchains and peer-to-peer networks of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, to cluster addresses and tie them to IP addresses or other identifying information.
Unsatisfied with Bitcoin’s privacy features, several cryptocurrency projects have, over the years, launched with the specific goal to improve on them. And not without success. Several of these privacycoins are among the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market today.
However, as detailed in this month’scover story, Bitcoin’s privacy features have recently seen significant improvements as well and are set to further improve over the next months and years. This miniseries will compare different privacycoins to the privacy offered by Bitcoin.
In part 3: Verge
Verge(XVG) was originally launched in 2014 as “Dogecoin Dark” by Justin Sunerok, who is still lead developer of the project today. To cultivate a more serious image, the project rebranded to “Verge” in 2016. As a codebase fork of Dogecoin, its base protocol is similar to Bitcoin in many ways. (Dogecoin was a codebase fork of Litecoin, which was a codebase fork of Bitcoin.)
Verge has been in the news several times over the past year, most notoriously because the coin was successfully51%-attackedon multiple occasions. But Verge is probably best known for itspartnershipwith major porn site Pornhub, which made headlines all over the crypto media and beyond.
At the time of writing, Verge (XVG) claims the39th spoton altcoin market cap lists, down from a top-25 spot earlier this year. This makes it the fourth (and last) privacy-focused altcoin in the market cap top 50, after Monero, Dash and Zcash.
According to the subtitle of the the Verge “Black Paper,” which describes the project, Verge is “the most privacy focused cryptocurrency.” However, even the Verge project leaders themselves appear to be a bit more equivocal on this point. Describing (what seems to refer to) Monero as “too private,” theVerge Currency Beginner’s Guidewritten and published by Verge Currency Core members instead argues that privacy should be optional.
This optionality is represented by Verge’s “Wraith protocol.” The Wraith protocol would let users choose whether they want to conduct a regular transaction (like a normal Bitcoin transaction) or a RingCT transaction, similar to Monero. RingCT transactions include “decoy” coins in transactions to obfuscate which coin is really being spent and also hides the amounts involved in a transaction for everyone but the payer and payee.
However, RingCT transactions have actually not yet been implemented at this point in time. As such, Verge users can only make regular transactions.
Whathasbeen implemented are optional stealth addresses. Stealth addresses are perhaps best understood as cryptographic puzzles. They essentially allow thesenderof XVG to generate a brand new Verge address to send the XVG to, which can then be claimed by the owner (andonlyby the owner) of the stealth address. The main benefits are that several Verge addresses can be generated from the same stealth address and that the stealth address cannot be linked to the actual addresses on the blockchain by anyone but the payer and the payee. This means that the stealth address can be posted online, perhaps as a donation address, without the user needing to worry about his privacy.
But Verge’s main privacy offering is probably a very different type of privacy: privacy on the peer-to-peer network layer.
The peer-to-peer network, of course, is where nodes transmit and relay all transactions and blocks to one another. Unfortunately, this network can be spied on, specifically by deploying nodes to track the data it receives from other nodes. If done right, this information can be used to figure out where certain transactions originated. If spies can link this originating node to an IP address, they’ve gone a long way toward de-anonymizing the creator of a transaction.
Verge counters peer-to-peer network analysis by having nodes and wallets communicate through Tor. By transmitting their transactions through the privacy-preserving, onion routing network, Verge users escape the prying eye of the spy. Tor is integrated into different Verge wallets by default, even including a mobile wallet for Android.
Since RingCT isn’t delivered yet, the only privacy features offered by Verge today are stealth addresses and Tor.
Of these, only stealth addresses counter blockchain analysis — to some extent. This is a good feature, especially for some specific use cases (like donation addresses). But it is also a bit limited. Besides, simply generating a new (regular) address for each payment (which is standard in many Bitcoin wallets and also possible on Verge) and not sharing this address with anyone but the payer (which shouldn’t be too difficult) offers similar privacy in most cases. Further, stealth addresses are also available for Bitcoin (viaSamourai Wallet).
As such, Verge’s only real differentiator would have to be Tor integration. This is a well-established solution to counter network analysis, and the fact that Verge offers it by default is good from a privacy standpoint — though Tor can slow the network down a bit.
However, Verge isn’t really unique in this regard either. Bitcoin can also be used over Tor, as can other cryptocurrencies. Granted, this does sometimes require some technical knack, which not everyone has. Verge offers a more user-friendly experience in this regard.
Bitcoinislikely to adoptDandelion, a recent proposal to counter network analysis. This solution doesn’t encrypt all network traffic like Tor does, but it uses a clever trick to obfuscate the source of transactions that goes a long way to achieve the same goal with less overhead. That said, Dandelion is not implemented yet.
The much bigger problem for Verge is that network analysis is only one strategy to de-anonymize cryptocurrency users. And it’s almost certainly not the main one: blockchain analysis probably offers spies much more de-anonymizing data. As long as some addresses can be linked to real-world identities, address clustering tools can go a long way toward breaking all user privacy. In a world where a large chunk of all transactions are to and from KYC/AML compliant exchanges, protecting privacy on the peer-to-peer network alone probably doesn’t achieve much at all.
Thus, at least until RingCT is implemented, Verge can not reasonably be considered a privacycoin on par with Monero, Zcash or even Bitcoin — if it can be considered a privacycoin in the first place. It is definitely not “the most privacy focused cryptocurrency.”

11137,2017-12-31 18:00:00,Will Square Stock Double Again in 2018?,"One of this year's biggest surprises wasSquare(NYSE: SQ), soaring 154% in 2017. The mobile-payments provider had a quiet run since going public at $9 in late 2015 until this past year's blazing burst. Square stock rose a mere 4% in 2016. However, now that Square has emerged as a market darling, the attention turns to lofty expectations for the year ahead.
Square's ascent has been the handiwork of healthy merchant adoption of its platform, a steady string of blowout quarters, and the good fortune of being seen as a bitcoin play. There will be a lot of hype to live up to in 2018, but if Square proves to be a pleasant market surprise, it wouldn't be the first time.
Image source: Square.
Square isn't on fire as it heads into the new year. The shares have retreated 30% since peaking in late November. We can probably blame the December sell-off on bitcoin fatigue. Square stock soared in November after the company started allowing some of its Square Cash app users the ability tobuy and sell bitcoins. With cryptocurrencies gaining steam and not too many publicly traded companies stepping up as legitimate marketplaces, Square took off. The rally wasn't going to be a sustainable.
Square had already more than doubled before it became a bitcoin play, and that's important in assessing if 2017's monster run can continue in 2018 outside the crypto craze. The platform is as popular as ever. Merchants completed nearly $17.4 billion in transactions through Square inits latest quarter, 31% more than a year earlier. Square got its start reaching out to small merchants and entrepreneurs, but these days its biggest gains in gross payment volume is coming from mid-market businesses.
Revenue is growing faster than its payment volume, fueled by an 84% surge in subscription and services-based revenue. Adjusted revenue rose 45% in the third quarter, and Square bumped its top-line guidance to 40% at the midpoint for all of 2017.
The real explosion at Square has come on the bottom line. Profits continue to grow faster than revenue, and a big reason for its blowout 2017 is that it has blown past Wall Street's profit target with ease in each of the past four quarters.
[{""Metric"": ""Q4 2016"", ""EPS (Estimated)"": ""($0.09)"", ""EPS (Actual)"": ""($0.04)"", ""Suprise"": ""56%""}, {""Metric"": ""Q1 2017"", ""EPS (Estimated)"": ""($0.07)"", ""EPS (Actual)"": ""$0.05"", ""Suprise"": ""171%""}, {""Metric"": ""Q2 2017"", ""EPS (Estimated)"": ""($0.05)"", ""EPS (Actual)"": ""$0.07"", ""Suprise"": ""240%""}, {""Metric"": ""Q3 2017"", ""EPS (Estimated)"": ""$0.05"", ""EPS (Actual)"": ""$0.07"", ""Suprise"": ""40%""}]
Data source: Yahoo! Finance.
The bottom-line beats have become the norm, and that's exciting as we head into 2018. Analysts are targeting 73% in earnings growth for the year ahead, but the trend suggests that Square will grow its profitability even stronger than that. Given the stock's heady valuation at this point, keeping the big beats coming will probably have to continue if Square is going to deliver another year of stellar returns.
Square surprised the market by turning a profit sooner than expected. It will need new surprises and make sure its platform popularity keeps growing at a brisk pace if it wants any shot at doubling again in 2018.

Sats App is a noncustodial wallet that allows users to manage their lightning nodes straight from their mobile phone,CoinDesk writes. Casa is planning to add a rewards program to attract more cryptocurrency early adopters, who can earn cryptocurrency and learn about cryptocurrencies and node management.
“Features are focused on increasing adoption of bitcoin and lightning nodes,” said Casa CEO Jeremy Welch. “You will be able to earn bitcoin if you don’t have a Casa node, but you will be able to earn bitcoin faster if you have a node.”
The app will currently be available only to Casa customers, with a full roll-out planned for later this month. According to Welch, although the app is “lightweight,” it offers multiple actions — earning sats and operating a full node. “It’s private, secure and connects over Tor,” he added.

And many economists are still projecting another cut in December is likely on the table as well.ButDonald Trump's electionwin is shifting how economists are viewing the path forward for the Fed come 2025. As Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul has reported: Trump's main campaign promises — a new wave of tariffs and a “mass deportation” of undocumented immigrants —could put new upward pressure on prices, many economists say.That sentiment played out in markets and Wall Street's Fed forecasts on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) spiked as much as 17 basis points to hit 4.46%. The move extended a recent surge in Treasurys as economic growth data has largelycome in better than expectedsince the Fed slashed rates by half a percentage point on Sept. 18.Markets have now moved from seeing nearly eight cuts when the Fed first cut rates back in September to now pricing in about four cuts through the end of next year.Wells Fargo chief economist Jay Bryson had projected seven interest rate cuts from the Fed over the next year. But Bryson wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that there are now clear risks to their forecast.""The FOMC may not want to ease policy by that much if new tax cuts and tariffs cause inflation to shoot higher over the next couple of years,"" Bryson wrote. ""Thus, we think the risks to our fed funds rate forecast are skewed to the upside (i.e., less easing next year than we currently project).""Given Wednesday's Fed decision feels widely anticipated, any commentary on how Trump policies could impact the Fed's path forward will be sure to grab investor attention during Fed chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.

Today we're a full-service digital asset prime brokerage providing a range of services across the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Our current momentum and trajectory are just the start of what's to come in 2021 for Hut 8 and its investors.""
The BTC Yield account is central to Hut 8 strategy, allowing the company to leverage Bitcoin to earn interest in Fiat, enabling payment to operational expenditure in centralized currency and ultimately increasing Hut 8's capacity to HODL.

The app syncs to your Coinbase web account, so updates will show instantly in both.
Coinbase previously launched an app for Android users. With both apps, Coinbase anticipated the concerns of users who might be wary of installing an app that links directly to their bank account: You can set a passcode to obtain a measure of security. And should your phone become lost or stolen, you can remotely disable access to the app.
The iPhone app debuts at a time when Bitcoin is riding high on a wave of media coverage and new users. On Coinbase, the buy price for a single bitcoin is about $200, the highest since April. The sell price is about $197.
Michael Terpin, co-founder of BitAngels, a group that invests in Bitcoin startups, says the recent price surge is owed largely to increasing Bitcoin adoption in China. On October 14, Baidu, a diversified internet company that runs the No. 1 search engine in China, began accepting bitcoins for the web services offered by Jiasule, one of its subsidiaries.
""All of a sudden businesses have at least one example of a large company saying it is going to accept Bitcoin,"" Terpin says. Baidu, which trades publicly on Nasdaq, has a market cap of $53 billion. This stamp of approval from a major corporation, aided by official Chinese silence on Bitcoin's legality, became ""a call to action,"" he says. There are now at least 10 China-based Bitcoin exchanges, and the largest, BTCChina, sees nearly as muchtrading volumeas Japan-based Mt. Gox, the No. 1 exchange.
Related:Payment Processor Dwolla Unexpectedly Cuts Ties With Bitcoin
Along with increased interest, however, Bitcoin has weathered a number of shocks in recent months. The most notable was the shutdown of online black market Silk Road and the arrest of its alleged founder, Ross Ulbricht, on October 2. Also this month, payment processing company Dwolla decided to stop serving Bitcoin-related businesses.
Emily Spaven, a writer for CoinDesk, a Bitcoin news site,said this weekthat the global media coverage of Silk Road's shutdown and its aftermath may in fact have benefited Bitcoin by raising its profile and polishing its image. Some people may feel more confident using Bitcoin now that it is no longer the currency of choice for a famous illegal bazaar.
""There are a number of people who feel that with this out of the way, it's going to be easier to deal with regulatory authorities,"" Terpin says.
The value of Bitcoin has been climbing steadily for the past three weeks, ever since the news of Silk Road's closing caused a brief sharp drop in the cryptocurrency's price. But it may soon level off or decline, according to market watchers.
Just as with stocks, ""there's a psychological pullback point,"" Terpin says. ""It will be a first if this is a long bull market with no pullback. Three weeks has been an eternity in Bitcoin.""
But over the long-term, he says, ""there are a lot of bulls in the Bitcoin market, including most of the Bit Angels.""

3058,2019-05-27 22:09:12,Natural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Whipsaw on Flat LNG Deliveries,"Natural gas prices continued to whipsaw on Monday despite a holiday in the US that generated low liquidity. Demand moved lower in the most recent week, and supply was flat. LNG exports were unchanged week over week. The weather is expected to become more mild in the 8-14 day forecast, which should weigh on natural gas demand.
Natural gas prices whipsawed lower closing below he most recent breakdown level during the long holiday weekend. Short term momentum has turned positive as the fast stochastic generated a crossover buy signal. The fast stochastic has rebounded after being in oversold territory which points to accelerating positive momentum. Medium term momentum is neutral. The MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram is printing in the black with a flat trajectory which points to consolidation.
The EIA reported this past week that LNG exports flat week over week. Eleven LNG vessels with a combined LNG-carrying capacity of 38.2 Bcf departed the United States from May 16 to May 22, according to shipping data. Three vessels,  one at each of the terminals, were loading on Wednesday.
Sempra Energy, the majority owner of the Cameron liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility, announced that the company has started to liquefy natural gas from the first of three liquefaction units, referred to as trains, coming online in Phase 1 of the project. Sempra Energy anticipates shipping LNG cargoes from Train 1 in the next few weeks, bringing total U.S. baseload operational LNG export capacity to about 4.8 billion cubic feet per day.
Net injections into storage totaled 100 Bcf for the week ending May 17, compared with the five-year (2014–18) average net injections of 88 Bcf and last year’s net injections of 93 Bcf during the same week. Working gas stocks totaled 1,753 Bcf, which is 274 Bcf lower than the five-year average and 137 Bcf more than last year at this time.

Meanwhile, gold prices dropped around 3% while crude oil prices jumped 20%.
Nonetheless, bitcoin price touched as high as $48,000 yesterday after electric car makerTesla, Inc.TSLA invested $1.5 billion in the world’s largest cryptocurrency. The MarketWatch article further noted that Tesla revealed plans to accept bitcoin “as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt.”
In fact, institutional investors have begun to show keen interest in bitcoin, with global digital payments companyPayPal Holdings, Inc. PYPL launching several cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin buying and selling features in its platform. Millions of PayPal users and merchants will now be making and receiving payments in crypto. Interestingly, PayPal once staunchly criticized cryptocurrencies but now is one of its biggest fans.
Similarly, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, also expressed serious interest in some of the cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, on his Twitter account. Thus, support from Tesla and PayPal among several others boosted demand for the asset class, thereby contributing toward its price rally.
At the same time, many now perceive cryptocurrency, in particular, bitcoin, as a safe-haven asset. It is considered to act as a hedge against market gyrations and rise in prices of essential commodities. Moreover, given the coronavirus outbreak and its impact on economies worldwide, many companies are now holding less cash and converting their cash treasuries into cryptocurrency. For instance, American payment companySquare, IncSQ has bitcoin as part of its balance sheet reserve.
What’s more, the interest shown by big corporates should certainly egg on retail investors to show interest in bitcoin, something they have restrained from amid the pandemic. The rise in demand for bitcoin should lift its price further and things should look brighter for companies that are not only making direct use of bitcoin but also technologies that support it, like blockchain.
On such a positive note, let us keep an eye on some stocks that are benefitting from the rising bitcoin trend and are well poised to make the most of the growing demand for blockchain technology. Of course, as mentioned above, PayPal and Square are poised to gain at the moment.
PayPal, currently, has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 0.89% over the past 60 days.

In the ever-changing landscape of the cryptocurrency market, major tokens such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are undergoing significant fluctuations, presenting both challenges and opportunities for investors. Amidst this dynamic environment, theFurrever Token (FURR)emerges with an innovative marketing strategy aimed at attracting Bitcoin and Ethereum holders, further diversifying the crypto ecosystem with its unique thematic focus and competitive initiatives.
Navigating Bitcoin's ""Danger Zone"": Market Dynamics and Speculations
Bitcoin (BTC) has been experiencing considerable volatility, currently trading at approximately $61,229.50, marking a slight increase of 0.65% from the previous day. This instability is particularly evident as BTC recently tested the critical $60,000 support level, a move that has heightened caution among investors. This phase is often described as the ""danger zone,"" a term used to denote the turbulent period following Bitcoin's halving events.
During trading on May 10, Bitcoin's price momentarily dipped to an intraday low of $60,190 on Bitstamp, down from attempts to stabilize around $63,000. This sudden decrease has sparked widespread speculation among traders and analysts. Many believe that large-volume institutional actions, coupled with the temporary closure of the BTC ETF market, might have driven the drop.
Despite this recent dip, market experts like Rekt Capital remain optimistic, suggesting that the end of this challenging ""danger zone"" could be in sight. Historically, such periods have been marked by sharp downturns followed by eventual stabilizations. The current market scenario of BTC demonstrates the complex interplay between market sentiment and institutional influences, which continues to dictate the cryptocurrency's price movements. As Bitcoin navigates through these fluctuations, the broader crypto community watches closely, anticipating the cryptocurrency's next moves in this unpredictable market landscape.
Ethereum Faces Market Headwinds and Analyst Scrutiny
Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recently been trading at $2,927.63, marking a slight decrease of 0.25% from the previous day. This modest drop is part of a broader trend of challenges that have caught the attention of investors and analysts alike.
A significant event stirring the market was a major sell-off by an Ethereum whale who liquidated 6,714 ETH at a price of $2,903 each, culminating in a loss of approximately $6.5 million. This large-scale transaction has intensified concerns over Ethereum's future price direction. Market indicators are not promising, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showing a decrease in investor interest and key averages indicating a bearish outlook.
Despite Ethereum's substantial trading volume of $10.1 billion over the last 24 hours, the price has declined by 4.07%, fluctuating between $2,935.95 and $2,894.15. Analysts have pinpointed the $3,017 level as a crucial resistance point; surpassing this could potentially shift the momentum to a bullish trend and help Ethereum break out of its current descending channel pattern.
However, several factors are complicating this outlook. The cryptocurrency has been in a descending channel since mid-March, and the delayed approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has added to the bearish sentiment. Moreover, the recent Dencun hard fork, which was intended to enhance Ethereum's scalability, did not have the expected positive impact on its price, leading to further speculation about its effectiveness and future impact on Ethereum's market performance.
These developments paint a complex picture for Ethereum as it navigates through ongoing market challenges and investor scrutiny.
Furrever Token Launches $20,000 Competition to Attract Bitcoin and Ethereum Investors
TheFurrever Token (FURR)has introduced an exciting $20,000 competition, targeting holders of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to diversify into its presale phase, which prominently features cat-themed imagery and an engaging, playful ecosystem. Operating on the BNB-20 blockchain, Furrever Token is currently offering 65% of its approximately 9 billion token supply to early investors, signaling a strong start with over $1 million raised in just two months.
As the presale progresses, Furrever Token continues to captivate the community's interest, with its current price set at a modest $0.000648. A notable aspect of this token is its absence of buy and sell taxes, which enhances its accessibility and affordability, appealing especially to new entrants in the cryptocurrency market.
The centerpiece of Furrever Token's promotional activities is the ""Furrever Token $20,000 Highest Total Buys Competition."" This contest is designed to spur enthusiasm and investment by rewarding the top 10 participants who purchase the most FURR tokens during an 18-day period from May 9, 2024, at 17:00 UTC, to May 27, 2024, at 12:00 UTC. The top purchaser will be awarded $5,000, with descending prize amounts for the other top buyers.
This initiative not only underscores Furrever Token's commitment to building a robust and engaged community but also positions the token as a potentially lucrative opportunity for investors in major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, looking to leverage their holdings into new and promising digital assets.

79150,2023-09-21 06:03:05,Bitcoin's sustainable energy mix surpasses 50% amid reduced carbon footprint,"The Bitcoin network, with its continually increasing hash rate, has seen a corresponding decrease in its emissions intensity, according to recent reports from Bloomberg. Analyst Jamie Coutts explained that this trend is contrary to most other industries and could potentially trigger the next wave of institutional investment.
Data cited by Coutts on Monday revealed that the sustainable energy mix for Bitcoin has been steadily rising since 2021 and now exceeds 50%. This increase in sustainable energy use has resulted in a slower growth of emissions relative to the network's expansion. Coutts noted that the evolving relationship between Bitcoin network growth and the global push to transition from fossil fuels could ""catalyze a wave of institutional and even sovereign investment capital.""
Energy constitutes over 50% of mining's operational costs, providing an incentive to procure the cheapest energy sources. This has contributed to the network's rising hash rate while simultaneously reducing the industry's emissions or carbon intensity.
On Saturday, it was reported that the next generation of Bitcoin miners is focusing on alternative energy sources for efficiency. However, there has been ongoing debate about the percentage of sustainable energy used in Bitcoin mining. Cambridge University's model, which hasn't been updated since January 2022, suggests that mining from sustainable energy sources is just 37.6%.
Contrarily, climate technology venture investor and activist Daniel Batten argues that this figure is actually above 50%. He indicated that the Cambridge model does not consider off-grid mining and methane mitigation in its calculations. Earlier this year, Batten reported that Bitcoin mining emissions intensity had reached its lowest-ever level. He also predicted that the Bitcoin network will become carbon neutral by December 2024.
The analysis from Bloomberg also noted a significant drop in Bitcoin's energy usage since China and Kazakhstan imposed mining bans. The report highlighted a decline in Bitcoin energy intensity from 600 to 295.5 grams of CO2 per KWH, leading to a more decentralized sector. According to the data, Bitcoin emissions have plummeted 75% per dollar in its market capitalization, even though the price of BTC is 60% below its $63,000 all-time high.
The rising cost of mining Bitcoin has pushed miners to seek cheaper forms of energy, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and paving the way for a new economy for institutional investment. This shift has led to the emergence of green crypto mines powered by solar or wind energy, fostering an ideal energy transition as billions continue to flow into the ecosystem.

30411,2021-10-19 20:35:20,"Stock market news live updates: Strong earnings push stocks higher, S&P 500 ends with 5th straight day of gains","Stocks advanced on Tuesday as investors digested a slew of new earnings results that topped Wall Street's expectations, suggesting more companies were able to work through ongoing supply chain challenges and still generate solid profits.
The Dow gained nearly 200 points, or 0.6%, by the end of the trading day. Component stocks including The Travelers Companies (TRV) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) rose after posting stronger-than-expected earnings results, helping fuel the jump in the 30-stock index. The S&P 500 rose for a fifth straight session, marking its longest winning streak since August.
Consumer giant Procter & Gamble (PG) was also among the major companies to post estimates-topping quarterly results Tuesday morning, though the stock fell as the company also flagged the impact of rising materials and shipping prices. P&G said it expected to see $2.3 billion in after-tax expenses during the current fiscal year due to rising commodity and freight costs.
Companies including Netflix (NFLX) and United Airlines (UAL) are set to report results after market close.
The latest quarterly results, guidance and executive commentary from the broad array of companies still left to report are set to help illustrate the extent of how labor shortages, increasing input costs and lingering pandemic-related concerns have weighed on companies – and whether some firms have managed to more nimbly navigate this confluence of challenges.
""We're dealing with supply chain challenges because of the unique situation that we're in right now, where we've unleashed a lot of demand before businesses were really ready for it. That may persist for some time, drive volatility, raise some concerns,"" Brian Levitt, Invesco global market strategist of North America, told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday. ""But ultimately I think the supply-demand imbalances will moderate, enabling this cycle to move on further.""
""What you want to hear from businesses are those that continue to believe that demand is going to be strong, and continue to believe that they have some ability to work through the supply challenges and pass on some of those costs to consumers,"" he added. ""It's not a rising tide that lifts all boats type of environment. It’s an economy that’s likely to slow some in here, and pricing pressures are going to be with us a bit ... Those businesses that can pass on these costs are going to be the winners.""
The companies that have so far reported third-quarter earnings results — including the big U.S. banks and an assortment of other names like Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) — have largely posted better-than-expected profits. Heading into this week, 8% of S&P 500 companies had reported third-quarter results, and 80% of these firms topped consensus estimates,according to FactSet.
And as Savita Subramian, Bank of America's head of U.S. and equity quant strategy, pointed out in a note on Monday, many of these companies had relatively little foreign sales exposure, or less than one-fifth of their overall revenue from international sources. Forthcoming earnings reports from companies with greater reliance international sales may provide an even more comprehensive view of the impact of the global supply chain challenges.
""Supply chain concerns are very, very real,"" Wells Fargo CEO and President Charles Scharf told Yahoo Finance's Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwerduring a panel at the Milken Institute Global Conference on Monday.""Inventory levels are down, and people are finding ways to compensate for that. So profit levels overall are very, very strong because people are raising prices, so there is inflation how long that goes on for we can debate, but it is very real.""
""The supply chain problems aren't going to get solved overnight,"" he added. ""They will get solved, but until then, I certainly worry about the evenness of [whether] small businesses versus large businesses be able to continue on the same trajectory.""

New homebuilding sank in September compared to August as labor scarcities and rising prices weighed on construction activity in the housing market.
Starts for new residential construction declined by 1.6% last month, theCommerce Department said in its monthly report Tuesday.This brought starts down to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1.555 million, or the lowest in five months. August's housing starts were also downwardly revised, with these rising by just 1.2% versus the 3.9% increase previously reported. Consensus economists expected housing starts to come in unchanged on a month-over-month basis.
Building permits, which serve as an indicator of future construction, sank by 7.7% in September over the prior month, whereas consensus economists were looking for a drop of just 2.4%. August's building permits were also downwardly revised to show an increase of 5.6%, down from the 6.0% gain reported in the previous print.

44788,2018-08-25 14:03:56,Reddit co-founder: Why I’m betting on bitcoin despite its volatility,"The last 12 months have been a whirlwind for Alexis Ohanian.
The 35-year-old co-founder of Reddit, now owned by Condé Nast, announced in February he was stepping away from his day-to-day duties at the popular news aggregator and discussion site to focus on the venture capital firm, Initialized Capital.
“I’ve wanted for a long time to get back to early stage founders to being the ‘first check’ in Initialized,” says Ohanian, who had a child with tennis athlete Serena Williams last September. “It’s a lot of fun, frankly. I get to come home and have really good dinner table conversations about the things I did at work, and it’s always [about] meeting new founders, learning about the future and then sometimes rolling up my sleeves.”
Since he co-founded the firm in 2011 with general partner Garry Tan, Initialized Capital has financed hundreds of ventures, including Instacart and the GM-owned (GM) self-driving company Cruise. As an investor in Bitcoin and Coinbase investors, it’s also little surprise that Ohanian remains particularly bullish on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, despite their volatility. (The prices of bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are down almost 56%, 67%, and 85% so far this year, respectively.)
“As a store of value, there is some real traction [with bitcoin], and actually as we’re seeing in countries like Turkey that are having significant economic crisis — where people are losing faith in the Turkish lira — we’re going to see money move over to bitcoin because as unstable as it is, it is actually a lot more stable for a lot of people than their own nations’ fiat currency,” predicts Ohanian. “But right now, we’re still in the earliest, earliest stages.”
Ohanian and Tan are just a few of the bigger names to invest in cryptocurrency, alongside venture capitalist Tim Draper, Digital Currency Group CEO and founder Barry Silbert, and Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who launched the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini in 2015.
While bitcoin is slowly gaining more widespread acceptance as a currency to purchase say,jewelry, book hotel rooms off Expedia (EXPE) and order goods off Overstock.com, widespread usage and acceptance is decidedly a long ways off. But volatility aside, there are some more recent promising signs, too. In mid-August, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said the cryptocurrency exchange enabled users to trade $150 billion in cryptocurrency in 2017 and racked up50,000 users a dayduring the same period.
“No matter what the currency prices are doing, seeing more and more people creating accounts … shows more and more adoption, and their end game is to be this interface between people, their fiat money and crypto — it would be the most user friendly trusted safe secure way to do it,” Ohanian added. “I just encourage people not to get too, too invested in the speculation around the day-to-day trading of the currencies.”
Besides crypto, Ohanian is also bullish on computer vision, an application of artificial intelligence that involves processing and analyzing digital images and videos already employed by Pinterest, Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) with its automatedAmazon Go stores. One of Initialized Capital’s investments, Standard Cognition, wants to bring the same cashier-free experience Amazon Go offers to other brick-and-mortar retailers.
“This is a narrower definition of artificial intelligence,” Ohanian explains. “You’re not teaching a robot to have a conversation; you’re not teaching a robot to be a human. You’re teaching a robot just to see a very specific thing, and because of the way processing power has grown and that the cost for it has declined we have companies like Standard Cognition which is doing real-time computer vision to basically reproduce Amazon and go for any other retailer. So now they can set up some basic cameras and in real time know, ‘here is this entity walking in.’ They’ve picked up this jar of peanut butter and this thing of a coffee, and they can walk out and get charged for it without having actually do a manual check-out process.”
Whether such investments ultimately succeed, of course, remains to be seen, but those are the bets long-term-looking investors like Ohanian are willing to take.

The price ofbitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, tumbled 7.6% to about $52,800. It was the biggest decline in a month and trimmed the year-to-date gain to about 83%.
Some 40,000 BTC ($2.1 billion worth) have been transferred to exchanges since Friday on major crypto exchanges, pushing up the bitcoin reserves to levels not seen since the end of January, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.

Ki Young Ju, CEO of South Korea-based crypto data firm CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk that the bitcoin inflow mostly went to the U.S-based Gemini, which saw some 34,000 BTC come in before Monday’s market sell-off.
The blockchain data appear to show a flow of about 28,000 BTC to Gemini around 2 p.m. New York time (19:00 UTC) on Sunday, right around the time the cryptocurrency’s price reached the $58,000 level, according to CryptoQuant.
Monday’s price slide coincided with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s comments at the New York Times’sDealBook DC Policy Projectthat bitcoin is not widely used as a “transaction mechanism.”
The cryptocurrency represents an “extremely inefficient way” of conducting transactions, Yellen said, and “the amount of energy that’s consumed in processing those transactions is staggering.”

If bitcoin breaks below $50,000, it might then fall to a range of $40,000 to $42,000 before finding a new technical support level on price charts, Singapore-based QCP Capital said Monday on its Telegram broadcast channel.
“We have $54,000 as the first trendline support, a break of which will take us to $50,000, which is the stronger second trend-line support,” QCP Capital wrote. “Forced retail liquidations could take us to test the $40,000-$42,000, which is the hedge fund trading level corresponding to the parabolic trendline.”
“The $40,000 level needs to hold “to preserve the strong bullish momentum,” QCP added.

83983,2024-07-17 09:37:00,"1 Vanguard ETF That Could Soar 41.5% in the Remainder of 2024, According to a Select Wall Street Analyst","Wall Street doesn't always get things right, but Tom Lee from Fundstrat Global Advisors is one analyst with a hot hand right now. He predicted theS&P 500index would close above 4,750 in 2023, and it ended the year at 4,769. He also entered 2024 with an S&P index target of 5,200, which was the highest on Wall Street at the time, and the index blew past that level within the first three months.
Lee also predicted theRussell 2000could soar 50% in 2024. This index is home to approximately 2,000 of the smallest listed stocks in the U.S., with the largest company in the index worth just $53 billion. Lee cites valuations and the potential for lower interest rates as key reasons for his prediction.
The Russell 2000 had a sluggish first half of 2024, so it will have to climb 41.5% between now and the end of the year to meet Lee's forecast. TheVanguard Russell 2000 ETF(NASDAQ: VTWO)closely tracks the performance of the index, so it's a simple way for investors to capture that gain if he turns out to be right.
Thanks to the meteoric rise of trillion-dollar giants likeNvidia, technology is the largest sector in the S&P 500, with a weighting of 30%. TheRussell 2000is a little more balanced -- the industrial sector has the largest weighting at 19%, followed by healthcare at 15.2% and financials at 14.8%.
The top-10 holdings in the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF make up just 5.2% of its total value, so its performance isn't beholden to a mere handful of stocks:
[{""Stock"": ""1.Super Micro Computer"", ""Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF Portfolio Weighting"": ""1.50%""}, {""Stock"": ""2.MicroStrategy"", ""Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF Portfolio Weighting"": ""0.85%""}, {""Stock"": ""3.Comfort Systems USA"", ""Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF Portfolio Weighting"": ""0.44%""}, {""Stock"": ""4.Onto Innovation"", ""Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF Portfolio Weighting"": ""0.40%""}, {""Stock"": ""5.Carvana"", ""Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF Portfolio Weighting"": ""0.39%""}, {""Stock"": ""6.Elf Beauty"", ""Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF Portfolio Weighting"": ""0.38%""}, {""Stock"": ""7.Fabrinet"", ""Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF Portfolio Weighting"": ""0.33%""}, {""Stock"": ""8.Scientific Games"", ""Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF Portfolio Weighting"": ""0.32%""}, {""Stock"": ""9.Weatherford International"", ""Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF Portfolio Weighting"": ""0.32%""}, {""Stock"": ""10.Abercrombie & Fitch"", ""Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF Portfolio Weighting"": ""0.32%""}]
Data source: Vanguard. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of May 31, 2024 and are subject to change.
Super Micro stock is up a whopping 218% this year so far. Investors are bullish on the company's role in artificial intelligence (AI), which includes selling networking, server, and storage equipment for the data center.
MicroStrategy stock is also having a great year with a 103% gain. It offers a portfolio of software products designed to help businesses extract more value from their data using AI. But the company is also a proxy forBitcoin, given that it holds around $12.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency.
Carvana stock also roared back to life this year with a 178% return, but it's still down 62% from its all-time high, which was set during the tech frenzy of 2021. The company sells used cars online with a focus on automation using its vending-machine style buildings.
Elf Beauty and Abercrombie & Fitch are further examples of consumer companies putting up strong numbers this year.
According to theCME Group's FedWatch tracker, the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates three times before the end of the year (in September, November, and December). In that environment, risk-free assets, like cash deposits and bonds, will be less attractive. This often pushes investors into stocks, instead. That's good news for the overall market but especially positive for small caps.
Small companies often borrow money to fuel growth and typically have more floating-rate debt, which is very sensitive to changes in monetary policy. In contrast, the tech giants that dominate the S&P 500 are sitting on billions of dollars in cash.Apple, for example, just announced a $110 billion stock-buyback program, which basically means the company makes so much money that it can't find a better use for it internally.
Lower interest rates will drive down borrowing costs for small caps, which means they can take on more debt and potentially drive faster growth. Plus, smaller interest payments will be a direct tailwind for each company's earnings.
Lee cites valuations as another reason the Russell 2000 could soar. The index trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.9 (excluding companies with negative earnings). The S&P 500 trades at a P/E ratio of 24.3, which makes the Russell look quite attractive by comparison.
Of course, the S&P 500 trades at a premium because of the quality of its constituents. Investors will always pay a higher valuation for stocks likeMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia because they're secure organizations with track records of success spanning decades. But if lower rates boost small-cap earnings, the valuation gap could narrow.
Here's where things get tricky. Going all the way back to 1988, the Russell 2000 hasneverrecorded an annual gain of 50%. In fact, it consistently underperformed the S&P 500, on average.
The federal funds rate was below 1% for most of the last decade, yet the Russell 2000 was up just 85% over that period, compared to a 185% gain in the S&P 500:
Plus, the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 9.9% since its inception in 2010, sharply lagging the 14.5% average annual return of theVanguard S&P 500 ETF. That 4.6% differential substantially impacted returns when compounded over the last 14 years:
[{""Starting Balance (2010)"": ""$10,000"", ""Compound Annual Return"": ""9.9% (Russell 2000 ETF)"", ""Balance In 2024"": ""$37,734""}, {""Starting Balance (2010)"": ""$10,000"", ""Compound Annual Return"": ""14.5% (S&P 500 ETF)"", ""Balance In 2024"": ""$66,651""}]
Calculations and chart by author.
While it's entirely possible for the Russell 2000 to deliver a positive return in the remainder of 2024, history suggests it's extremely unlikely to climb 41.5% to end the year with a 50% gain. With that said, small caps might be a good place for investors to park their money when interest rates begin to fall, so adding the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF to a balanced portfolio isn't a bad idea.

13138,2018-01-14 17:40:00,What Is Spotify's Valuation Right Now?,"Spotify is causing a stir in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street.
The London-based music streaming service filed confidential IPO paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission at the end of December, sources toldAxioson Jan. 3.
While the company is said to be pursuing a direct listing on the NYSE in the first half of 2018, it has still enlisted the help ofGoldman Sachs(NYSE: GS),Morgan Stanley(NYSE: MS), and Allen & Co. as advisors. A direct listing is different, and crucially, less expensive than a traditional IPO because it means the company can skip the typical IPO roadshow process.
So if Spotify lists its shares in the next couple of months, what will its valuation be? Let's take a closer look.
Spotify CEO Daniel Ek (above) might be taking his company public in early 2018. Image source: Spotify.
Spotify started in Sweden in 2006 when founders Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon were brainstorming business ideas and realized it was difficult to get the music they wanted on Napster despite the company being six years old.
The entrepreneurs got their first cash injection about two years later with a $21.5 million Series A funding round in 2008. Spotify then raised a Series B of $50 million in August 2009 at a $250 million valuation from three investors. The company then raised a Series C, D, E, F, and G, as well as a few lines of credit.
Most recently, the company agreed to buy a stake in China'sTencent(NASDAQOTH: TCEHY)Music Entertainment, which runs three music streaming services. In a tit-for-tat deal, Tencent will also buy an equity stake in Spotify.
In total, Spotify has raised $2.7 billion, according to Crunchbase Data, while CB Insights pegs the number a bit lower at $2.27 billion.

After billions in funding, growing its user base to 140 million with 70 million paying subscribers, where does Spotify's valuation stand?
After Spotify and Tencent agreed to exchange minority stakes in each other, sources told Reuters in December that its valuation is now at least $19 billion.
That's a sharp rise from the $13 billion valuation Spotify reportedly had last May when it first reached out to banks about advising it on a possible IPO.
This is where things get interesting.
Despite still being a private company, Spotify is the definite leader in the music streaming space.
Spotify said it hit70 million paid subscribersthis month, while its biggest competitor,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)Music, toldBillboardin September that it had less than half that amount, withjust over 30 million subscribers.
Potential Spotify investors may also be interested to know that Spotify is still growing at an impressive rate, adding about 2 million subscribers per month last year. Apple added about 1 million subscribers per month in 2017.
Of course, Apple did buy Shazam in December and could use its music-discovery capabilities to provide some cool new services for its subscribers. In addition, Shazam claims its app connects more than 1 billion people worldwide, which provides ahuge base of potential Apple Music subscribers.
Spotify's second closest competitor,Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN)Music, has only been around a little over a year. Last July, The Music Industry Blog, which tracks music app usage and spoke with industry experts, reported that the service had about 16 million paid subscribers.
That growth rate should be putting pressure on Spotify to keep updating its offerings. Spotify needs to stay one step ahead of Amazon, which lately seems to be encroaching on every market it feels like.
Of course, Apple and Amazon are both mature companies with multiple revenue streams. In fact, there's a debate about which of the two companies will hit a $1 trillion valuation first. Currently, Apple has an $898 billion market cap, while Amazon's is at $592 billion.
But what about the valuations of a more similar company, likePandora(NYSE: P)or Tidal?
Pandora's market cap sits at $1.29 billion, which isn't bad considering its stock has been on a pretty steady downward slope since 2014. In its latest earnings report, the company announced $379 million in revenue.
The problem for Pandora is that while it reported an impressive 73.7 million active listeners, that's still a drop from the 77.9 million it had in the year-ago period. Even worse, it had only 5.19 million paid subscribers, a 29% increase from the same period last year, but still, nothing to brag about. The company has had trouble convincing users to pay for its services.
Last March, Pandora launched its first on-demand streaming service, Pandora Premium, for $9.99 per month, the price that has somehow become the industry standard. This is on top of its $5 per month ad-free Pandora Premium subscription option that doesn't allow for replays, offline listening, or on-demand listening.
Three-year-old Tidal, bought by rapper Jay-Z from Swedish parent company Aspiro for $56 million in 2015, was valued at $600 million in January 2017 when itsold a 33% staketoSprint(NYSE: S)for $200 million. The last subscriber figure for Tidal comes from back in June 2016 when it claims it had 4.2 million subscribers.
In December, Norwegian business newspaperDagens Næringslivclaimed that Tidal had only enough money to last six more months. Tidal fought back against the claims, saying that its business had grown each year since its inception.
Either way, it's not super encouraging that Tidal hasn't shared an updated subscriber figure.
If this information tells you anything, it's that Spotify is in a good position ahead of its public offering. If it can keep current subscribers happy and keep adding about 2 million subscribers per month this year, then it might be worth investing in at its IPO.
The one thing that may concern investors is that Amazon and Apple have the money and power to make sudden movements that encroach on Spotify's top position, such as when Apple scooped up Shazam last month.
However, the company has been able to grow at a healthy rate all of 2017, despite its customers' having more and more options. And that's impressive.

8812,2019-12-27 13:16:18,Crypto Taxes — A Game Of Big Cats And Many Mice,"This year, the media storm that the whole crypto space had been in for the better part of 2017 has felt more like a soft and calm summer breeze. This might be because the meteoric rise in attention and value of blockchain projects has made way for an equally meteoric fall in 2018, also in attention and value. This, in turn, might have lead to mistrust and disinterest of many formerly enthused—and probably formerly rich—tech journalists.
This radio silence, save for a few sprinkled bits of negativity, makes one thing very surprising: bitcoin was one of the highest performing assets of 2019. Even including the recent downturn, the asset has about doubled in value this year.
This is great news for everyone who joined at the beginning of this year. But what happens when you want to spend some of your gains? When converting bitcoin back to fiat (or USD), you have to pay taxes on your gains.
So far, the IRS has been fairly lenient in the monitoring and prosecution of Crypto tax evasion. However, the wind is changing. There is a yearly potential of more than 10 billion USD in untapped tax revenue that the IRS might be missing out on.
To drive this point home, imagine that you bought all bitcoin on December 1, 2018, and have sold everything exactly one year later (ignoring the impossibility of this feat). How many taxes would you have to pay?
According to Coinmarketcap, the market cap of Bitcoin on Dec 1, 2018, was around 70 billion USD. One year later, on Dec 1 of 2019, it was closer to 140 billion USD. Therefore, the gains you would have realized would be around 70 billion USD. Even when calculating with a low tax rate of around 15%, that would leave around 10 Billion USD in taxes. While you would be pretty annoyed at that bill, there is one agency that would be very happy to take that money. Ten billion USD in taxes is a lot of gains for the IRS.
And since blockchains are public and cannot be altered or manipulated by design, all transactions connected to a name at any point in time can be indisputably identified.
Paired with the media talking about illegal action such as drug and weapons trading, it is not surprising that the IRS has taken note. Going after illegal drug and weapon markets sounds much more positive than looking for tax evasion.
In its annual report of 2019, which is only about 75 pages long, the words “bitcoin” and “crypto” are mentioned a total of 43 times. After a recap of the last 100 years and a letter of the Chief, the first topic on the agenda of the report is that of “cyber crimes”. In it, the IRS talks about tools that other agencies and NGOs are already using such as “Digital currency identification (bitcoin wallets, etc.)” and “extraction of data from proprietary financial software (tax preparation, accounting, payroll, point of sale systems, custom databases, etc.)”
This means that the IRS is going to take taxation of cryptos much more seriously.
With the attention that this is getting, it is to be expected that they will get to each and every relevant transaction and address sooner or later.
It is, therefore, becoming more and more important to file your taxes correctly. To make sure that you get to the bottom of your tax report before the IRS does, you can use one of the available coin tracking platforms.Accointingas one of them also offers a tax report that can be automatically generated and saves a lot of time and effort in calculating your yearly gains.

16408,2018-02-01 00:31:00,Why 2017 Was a Year to Remember for TransCanada Corporation,"TransCanada Corporation's(NYSE: TRP)stock rose around 8% in 2017, an advance that was relatively good when you compare it to North American midstream oil and natural gas bellwetherEnterprise Product Partners L.P.'s loss of around 2%. That said, business developments were the really memorable things last year. Here's a primer on the good and the bad news in 2017 that made the year so exciting for TransCanada Corporation and its shareholders.
TransCanada Corporation is one of North America's largest midstream oil and natural gas companies, with pipelines assets crisscrossing Canada and spread throughout the United States. It even has a handful of natural gas pipelines in Mexico. Generally speaking, the $40 billion market cap company needs to build large projects to keep its businesses growing.
Image source: Getty Images.
The future got a little less certain in 2017 when TransCanada announced it had abandoned plans to build the Energy East and Eastern Mainline pipeline projects in its home country of Canada. The company took a roughly $1 billion Canadian charge. The bigger issue, though, is that these projects were worth roughly $16 billion Canadian and would have transported around 1.1 million barrels of oil a day.As The Motley Fool's Matthew DiLallo recently noted, the long-term growth picture for TransCanada is a lot less certain at this point in time.
Luckily, though, all of the news from 2017 wasn't this bad. For example, the 2016 purchase of Columbia Pipeline Group helped TransCanada achievesolid earnings and cash-flow growth in the first halfof 2017. Although the third-quarter numbers were a little soft, that was the result of one-time charges and asset sales (Canadian solar assets were jettisoned, for example) that will help fund the company's near-term investment plans. Full-year results should be good reading, overall, all things considered.
TransCanada's results were solid across the board through the first nine months of 2017. Image source: TransCanada Corporation.
Operationally speaking, the midstream giant had some worthwhile successes. TransCanada brought a number of investments online in 2017, including the Northern Courier pipeline, the Rayne XPress pipeline, and and the Gibraltar pipeline. It also got the large Leach XPress project prepared to be successfully placed into service on January 1, 2018, setting this year up to be another good one on the top and bottom lines.The company is projecting as much as 10% earnings and dividend growth this year, by the way.
That said, there was one more bit of good news: The company finally got approval from the U.S. government for the Keystone XL pipeline. There's still more work to be done before it gets built, but that was a major hurdle for TransCanada on a project that made the company headline news in the United States during the previous administration. In early 2018, TransCanada reported solid customer demand for the pipeline. Assuming things go smoothly from here, this project, which once appeared to be dead in the water, should help to soften the blow from the Energy East setback.
TransCanada's project pipeline is still well stocked for the next few years. Image source: TransCanada Corporation.
TransCanada had a good year on the project front in 2017. And, perhaps more importantly, it still has a sizable portfolio of projects to build over the next few years, as well. In fact, even as the company was reporting the cancellation of Energy East, it highlighted an impressive $24 billion Canadian investment pipeline that should support 8% to 10% earnings and dividend growth through 2020. This backlog, by the way, should give management plenty of time to find additional projects (and possibly acquisitions) to keep the company growing beyond that point.
Although TransCanada's business results were solid in 2017, that's probably not what investors are going to remember about the year. The big news, which was a mix of good and bad things, was on the operations front, with the cancellation of Energy East and the U.S. government approval of Keystone XL being the most headline-worthy events. But even underneath those news grabbing stories there were some pretty positive things to remember, like a series of new pipelines either coming on line or getting very near it. At the end of the day, there was a lot of going on at TransCanada in 2017 to make it a memorable year for most investors.

7918,2017-11-22 16:21:10,"One of Wall Street's biggest bears just doubled his bitcoin forecast to $11,500","Bloomberg TV
• Tom Lee of Fundstrat has nearly doubled his forecast for bitcoin, calling for the cryptocurrency to hit $11,500 by mid-2018.
• Lee says that a recent dip in bitcoin's price wiped out weak, low-conviction holdings, clearing the path for further gains.
Well that sure escalated quickly.
Tom Lee,the managing partner and head of research atFundstrat Global Advisors, has almost doubled his forecast forbitcoin. He now expects the scorching-hot cryptocurrency to hit $11,500 by mid-2018, up from his previous estimate of $6,000 released in August.
The adjustment comes just a few weeks after Lee turned neutral on bitcoin, when it was hovering around the $7,400 level. At the time, he felt that there were simply too many ""weak hands"" holding the cryptocurrency with low conviction, leaving it susceptible to a sharp drop at the first sign of turbulence. In his mind, the appropriate level to start loading up on more bitcoin was around $5,500.
And sure enough, bitcoin fell last week to $5,600, which Lee says wiped out those fickle holdings and allowed him to resume his bullish view.
""This move to $5,600 cleaned up weak hands and we no longer feel caution is warranted,"" Lee wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.
Further, two variables thatexplain 94% of bitcoin's historical moves— according to a statistical model developed by Lee — have rebounded, further fueling his optimism. Those variables are unique bitcoin network addresses and transaction volume per user, which, when regressed against the price of bitcoin, can provide signals suggesting possibilities for the future direction of the cryptocurrency.
Fundstrat
Lee is also optimistic about thecoming launch of bitcoin futures, which many think will increase the cryptocurrency's legitimacy, thereby expanding its potential user base. Bitcoin hit a new record on the news. Lee does warn, however, that the use of futures could further concentrate mining power.
Looking beyond bitcoin, Lee is one of the most bearish analysts on Wall Street when it comes to the stock market. He sees the benchmarkS&P 500ending 2017 at 2,475, which puts him in the bottom quartile of strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. The average price target is 2,524.

39540,2018-07-06 18:46:54,Why Geron Corp. Stock Has Skyrocketed 90.6% in 2018 (So Far),"What happened Ahead of a make-or-break decision on imetelstat from collaboration partner Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) , shares in Geron Corp. (NASDAQ: GERN) have soared 90.6% through the first six months of 2018, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence . So what J&J licensed rights to imetelstat for hematologic myeloid malignancies, including myelofibrosis, in 2014, and while imetelstat holds promise as the first disease-modifying drug for this indication, there's been considerable doubt about its future. An ascending bar chart overlaid on top of a monitor displaying stock prices. Image source: Getty Images. Previously, J&J abandoned a low-dose arm of imetelstat after interim early-stage data proved to be disappointing. Also, questions about efficacy have dogged imetelstat following trial data showing that it might not reduce spleen volume by as much as Jakafi does, the standard of care. As a refresher, a reduction in spleen volume was the primary endpoint in trials enabling Jakafi's approval. J&J's license allows it to walk away from imetelstat following phase 2 and the above concerns had many industry watchers debating if it would exercise that option. However, there's growing optimism it may be willing to pursue phase 3 trials. Earlier this year, J&J approved an extension study to track and record data from patients already treated with imetelstat. Conceivably, J&J wouldn't have done that if it had already decided to abandon imetelstat. Also, J&J listed imetelstat as a potential top-seller in its pipeline during an investor presentation earlier this year, adding conviction to the thinking that it will continue developing it. Given Geron Corp's sub-$2 share price late last year and declining pessimism, it's easy to understand why shares have rallied significantly in 2018. Now what There's an undeniable need for new myelofibrosis treatments, and since Jakafi's annual sales exceed $1.5 billion, there's reason to think an eventual success that could support FDA approval would be a big win for Geron. About 75% of patients discontinue Jakafi within five years because of side effects, and the life expectancy for patients discontinuing treatment is just 14 months. Story continues If J&J continues development of imetelstat, then Geron can exercise co-commercialize rights. If so, it would pay 20% of future development costs, but it would collect a $65 million milestone payment and it could collect up to $820 million in additional development, regulatory, and sales-based milestones. If approved, it would collect royalties in the high teens to low 20% range, too. A decision against co-commercializing imetelstat would still pay off for Geron, though. In that scenario, it can collect a $135 million payment and up to $765 million in development, regulatory, and sales milestones. If approved, it would get low-double-digit to mid-double-digit percentage royalties. Alternatively, a decision by J&J to walk away would be a big blow. Developing imetelstat on its own would be costly and convincing another partner that J&J was wrong to abandon it could be tough. Overall, investors are betting on a positive outcome, but there's no guarantee of that happening, and for that reason, Geron is best left to aggressive investors able to withstand the heavy price of disappointment.

55481,2021-08-31 15:30:03,Why Is Square (SQ) Down 0.2% Since Last Earnings Report?,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Square (SQ). Shares have lost about 0.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Square due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.
Square reported second-quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of 66 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 106.3%. Further, the figure rose 266.7% year over year and 60.9% sequentially.Net revenues of $4.68 billion improved 143% from the prior-year quarter.However, the figure declined 7.4% from the previous quarter and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.02 billion.Year-over-year revenue growth was driven by strong momentum across the Cash App ecosystem, which contributed $3.33 billion to net revenues in the reported quarter, up 177% year over year.Solid momentum across bitcoin was the key catalyst. Without bitcoin revenues, net revenues would amount to $1.96 billion, up 87% year over year.Strong growth in transaction, subscription and hardware revenues contributed well to the results.Square witnessed solid traction across the seller ecosystem, which generated $1.31 billion of revenues, up 81% year over year. Accelerating gross payment volume (GPV) drove the results.However, uncertainties related to the pandemic remain concerning.Nevertheless, the company’s strengthening momentum across online channels, sellers and the Cash App is expected to act as tailwinds in the days ahead.
GPV in the second quarter amounted to $42.8 billion, up 88% from the year-ago quarter. This was driven by strength across the seller ecosystem. Notably, seller GPV accounted for 90% of the total GPV in the second quarter. Seller GPV was up 86% year over year.The robust performance of the Cash App, which accounted for $4.1 billion of the overall GPV (10%), remained a positive. The figure increased 107% year over year.The card-not-present GPV witnessed year-over-year growth of 41% in the second quarter. Robust online channels, including Square Online, Invoices, Virtual Terminal and eCommerce API, contributed to the upside.Square experienced a strong recovery in its card-present volumes in the reported quarter, owing to rising consumer spending and regional reopenings. Card-present GPV was up 128% from the year-ago quarter.
Transaction (26.3% of net revenues):The company generated transaction revenues of $1.23 billion, up 80% year over year. Strong seller ecosystem accounted for $1.12 billion of transaction revenues, up 78% year over year. The robust performance of the Cash App contributed $111 million to transaction revenues, up 107% year over year, owing to the rising number of transactions as well as business accounts.Subscription and services (14.6% of revenues):The company generated $685.2 million in revenues from the category, surging 98% from the year-ago quarter. The improvement can be attributed to a strong performance by the Cash App, which contributed $495 million to the category’s top line. The figure was up 83% from the year-ago quarter. Seller ecosystem contributed $151 million to subscription and services revenues, up 101% year over year. Positive contributions from the TIDAL acquisition benefited the top line forthis category.Hardware (0.9% of revenues):Square generated revenues of $43.7 million from thebusiness, up 126% year over year. This was driven by strong unit sales of hardware devices like SquareRegister and Square Terminal.Bitcoin (58.2% of revenues):The company generated revenues of $2.72 billion from thecategory, up significantly from $211.2 million. Square continued to benefit from the bitcoin space, driven by the increasing adoption of the Cash App. Rising bitcoin prices alongwith solid customer demand and increasing bitcoin actives were major positives.
Per management, gross profit grew 91% from the year-ago quarter to $1.14 billion. However, gross margin contracted 662 basis points (bps) year over year to 24.4%.Adjusted EBITDA was $360 million in the reported quarter, up 268% year over year.Operating expenses were$1.02 billion, jumping 64% from the prior-year quarter.Product development expenses were $327 million, up 57% year over year primarily due to rising headcount and personnel costs in engineering, data science and design teams.General and administrative expenses were $221 million, up 62% from the prior-year quarter. This was primarily caused by finance, legal, compliance and support personnel costs.Sales and marketing costs were $375 million, up 58% year over year due to an increase in Cash App marketing expenses and a hike in advertising, personnel and other costs.
As of Jun 30, 2021, the cash and cash equivalent balance was $4.6 billion, up from $3.02 billion as of Mar 31, 2021.Short-term investments were $1.01 billion in the reported quarter, up from $644.4million in the previous quarter.Long-term debt was $4.8 billion, increasing from $2.9 billion in the previous quarter.

Shares of the electric vehicle (EV) maker have been under pressure recently aftera Reuters report of a temporary production haltfor some vehicles at the company's gigafactory in China because of problems securing parts.
The plant had already gone through delays of about three weeks in April due to Covid lockdowns in Shanghai.
The stock has also been under pressure after Bitcoin (BTC-USD) sharply declined this week. Tesla bought some of the cryptocurrency to hold on its balance sheet last year.
The EV maker is down 38% year-to-date, while the Nasdaq Composite (^iXIC) is down about 27%.
The markets have been selling off since the Federal Reserve began tightening monetary policy in a move to tame inflation.
Electric vehicle stocks have gotten clobbered during the recent sell-off. Rivian (RIVN) is down 75% year-to-date. On Thursday the EV startup's stock jumped 18% following its quarterly results. Shares were trading above $23 each, a far cry from their all-time high of $179 in November of last year.
Lucid (LCID), XPeng (XPEV) and NIO (NIO) are down more than 50% year-to-date.

The630,000th block– which kicks off the new halving era – was mined by AntPool at 3:23 EST. The block contained 3,134 transactions and 0.90968084 BTC in transaction fees. The total transaction volume for the block was 3311.62144322 BTC.
The final pre-halving block was mined by F2Pool, the network's largest miner by current estimations and also the one that mined the first post-halving block back in 2016.
The halving takes placeroughly every four years, and the event itself forms a key part of bitcoin's digital scarcity model. With each halving, fewer bitcoins are produced with each block. Over the course of its lifetime, the bitcoin network will see the production of just 21 million BTC.
AntPool is,per estimates, the third-largest mining pool on the network today. According to data from U.K.-based firm Blockchain, AntPool mined 79 blocks in the past four days.

• The US$610 million debt financing facility from Tether will be used to drive investments across the firm’s three business lines, namely artificial intelligence firm Taiga Cloud, Ardent Data Centers and Peak Mining, the company’s Bitcoin mining subsidiary.
• The funds will also be used to acquire hardware for the Taiga Cloud business to expand its offerings as a generative artificial intelligence cloud service provider in Europe, Northern Dataannouncedon Thursday.
• The company also plans to use the investment to further scale its Bitcoin mining operations through its mining subsidiary, Peak Mining.
• The unsecured debt facility’s term ends on Jan. 1, 2030.
• Tether Chief Executive Officer Paolo Ardoino said the loan facility will be covered by the company’s profits and will not be part of its stablecoin consolidated reserves.
• “Tether has been achieving an average of [~1 billion] per quarter in net operating results as reported over the last quarters and the project remains the same going forward, due to the high interest rates on US T-Bills,” Ardoino said in a statement shared withForkast.“A significant portion of these profits has been prudently retained within our reserves, contributing to the accrual of excess reserves. This strategy has enabled us to overcollateralize our stablecoins by as much as 104%.”
• Tetheracquiredan undisclosed stake in Northern Data in September, as part of the stablecoin issuer’s move towards artificial intelligence.
• On Tuesday, Tether reported US$3.2 billion of excess reserves backing its stablecoins in its third quarterattestation. The stablecoin issuer claimed to have US$86.4 billion in reserves against US$83.2 billion in liabilities.
• Tether’s USDT is the world’s largest stablecoin with a market capitalization of US$84.9 billion, according toCoinMarketCapdata.

61918,2023-03-20 10:12:31,"Crypto Market Witnesses Odd Relationship Between Bitcoin, Ether Volatility Metrics","Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today For the first time in nearly two years, crypto options traders are implying that the largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin ( BTC ), will be more volatile than ether ( ETH ), the second-largest and the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. That's unusual because ether and alternative cryptocurrencies generally tend to be more volatile than bitcoin. The trend is reflective of a market squarely focused on macroeconomic issues. The spread between dominant crypto options exchange Deribit's forward-looking 30-day implied volatility index for ether (ETH DVOL) and bitcoin (BTC DVOL) fell below zero over the weekend, a phenomenon not seen since May 2021, according to data source Amberdata. Implied volatility refers to the options market's expectations for price swings over a specific period. Options are derivatives contracts that offer the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. ""Bitcoin is in the spotlight again as cracks in [the] fractional reserve banking system cause distrust in fiat systems,"" said Jeff Anderson, chief investment officer at quantitative trading firm and liquidity provider Folkvang. ""Bitcoin dominance has ripped higher this month as the market scrambles for hard money and protection from impending fiat supply inflation."" The spread between the 30-day implied volatilities for ether and bitcoin has flipped negative. Deribit's DVOL measures the implied volatility for bitcoin and ether. (Amberdata) Several U.S. banks have gone bust this month, complicating the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation and boosting demand for bitcoin as a safe haven. The cryptocurrency has gained over 20% since the start of March, outperforming ether's 11% rise, CoinDesk data shows. Bitcoin's dominance rate, or the share in the total crypto market, has increased to nearly 48% from 42%, according to data sourced from the charting platform TradingView. Meanwhile, ether's dominance rate has declined about 1 percentage point to 19% over the past week. Story continues While bitcoin and ether are said to compete as non-sovereign assets, bitcoin has a history of benefiting from banking sector issues and has evolved as a macro asset over the past three years, receiving the most attention from institutions. Meanwhile, the market continues to see ether more as a proxy for overall developmental activity in digital assets than as a haven investment. ""The negative spread is reflective of the two assets increasingly viewed as similar yet different proxies of risk, both markets are much deeper and liquid than the rest of the coins with established use cases,"" Patrick Chu, director of institutional sales and trading at over-the-counter crypto derivatives tech platform Paradigm, told CoinDesk. Mean reversion ahead? Implied volatility, or IV, is mean reverting, meaning that over time it tends to return to its lifetime average. Sophisticated traders, therefore, buy options or volatility futures when the implied volatility is unusually low and sell options or volatility futures when it is exceptionally high. Implied volatility has a positive impact on options prices. All this means the ETH-BTC IV spread could bounce back into the positive, boosting the value of ether options relative to bitcoin. ""I do think there is real value in owning ETH variance into the Shanghai upgrade,"" Anderson said, referring to an upcoming software upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain. ""The event risk there is underpriced and options appear cheap.""

In her resignation email Friday, Elizabeth Renieris cited ID2020’s opacity, “techno-solutionism” and corporate influence along with the risks of applying blockchain to immunity passes.
“At this stage, I can no longer even describe what ID2020’s mission is with any confidence,” wrote Renieris, who was one of six members of ID2020’s technical advisory committee. “All I can perceive is a desire to promote decentralized identity solutions at all costs.”
Related:Enigma Blockchain Has a New Name and a Privacy Boost in the Works
Renieris (an occasional CoinDeskcontributor) is a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University and an expert in cross-border data protection and privacy issues. She was previously in-house counsel at two digital identity startups.
Her concerns about the technology, which highlight the trade-offs between health and privacy during the pandemic, are spelled outin a white paper published in mid-May. She says the introduction of immunity passes could interfere with people’s privacy, freedom of association, assembly, and movement.
“Blockchain-enabled ‘immunity certificates’ or ‘immunity passports’ for COVID-19, if implemented by public authorities, would have serious consequences for our fundamental human rights and civil liberties,” she writes.
The discord within ID2020 hints at larger debates around where to use distributed ledger technology (DLT), and where it may create more problems than it solves. But when it comes to the issue of immunity passes, the stakes seem higher.

Renieris worries about how the influence of corporations like Microsoft may influence the development of these systems.
Kim Cameron, Architect of Identity at Microsoft, sits on ID2020’s board, and Kim Gagné,newly appointed as Board Chair, also worked at Microsoft.
“Who is doing the building here is a critical vulnerability, as critical as any technical challenge,” said Renieris. “This is 100% a hammer looking for a nail.”
Immunity passports or certificatesare digital or physical documents that individuals would receive if they had tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies. Traditionally, development of antibodies after a disease offers some level of immunity, though scientists are still working to sort out whether this is the case, or how long such immunity might last, when it comes to COVID-19. Potentially, immunity passports allow people to return to work and have greater freedom of movement.

In late April, the World Health Organizationwarned against the idea of immunity passports, and said there was “no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.” But countries such as Chilesaid they would move ahead with such passes, despite the WHO’s warning.
The ID2020 Alliance is a public-private partnership, with partners including Microsoft, Accenture and Hyperledger. It hopes to develop a global model for the design, funding, and implementation of “digital ID solutions and technologies,” according to the website.
ID2020 published awhite paperin April urging policymakers, technology providers, and civil society groups to collaborate to ensure that digital health credentials or “immunity certificates,” if implemented, are designed to protect privacy and civil liberties.
This is 100% a hammer looking for a nail.
According to Renieris, the paper initially cited the Covid Credentials Initiative (which is advocating for immunity passes based in part on blockchain) and Microsoft’s work with blockchain. It said these are potential solutions for privacy and identity questions around immunity passes. But when Renieris queried their inclusion, the section was dropped because, says Renieris, ID2020 did not want to deal with the tech problems those initiatives would raise.
The initiative neglects to acknowledge any technology-specific risks of a blockchain based approach, instead highlighting generic risks that could apply to any technological solution, said Renieris. While she says she was told the paper would be published as Executive Director Dakota Gruener’s personal view, the press release that was put out around the paper framed it as an ID2020 paper.
“I cannot be part of an organization overly influenced by commercial interests that that only pays lip service to human rights,” she wrote in her resignation. “The stakes are simply too high at this stage.”
In a statement to CoinDesk, Gruener said technology solutions are not a panacea for the pandemic and must be accompanied by robust, fit-for-purpose trust frameworks and legislative and regulatory actions to ensure ethical implementation and transparency.
ID2020 has sought feedback from civil liberties and digital privacy groups to ensure that these considerations are built into the technical architecture of any digital health certificate system.
“The stakes are high and we have one chance to get this right,” said Gruener. “Even with these safeguards in place, digital health certificates may still be insufficient to meet the current challenge. However, absent such safeguards, we can be assured that they will do more harm than good.”
As CoinDesk has reported previously, a number of organizations and companies are actively exploring theidea of immunity passes based on blockchain technology.

Renieriswrote the paperpublished in May with global health researcher Sherri Bucher of Indiana University School of Medicine,and Christian Smith, CEO of Stranger Labs, which researches, develops, and designs advanced technologies that enhance privacy and security.
In it they criticize the CCIinitiativeID2020 initially touted, which proposes combining a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard forVerifiable Credentials(VCs) with non-standarddecentralized identifiers(DIDs) and DLT. The architecture is a product ofpremature standardization, experimental technologies, and speculative requirements, the authors argue, questioning whether these solutions can support such a critical role in public safety as immunity passes.
They also criticize the lack of a proven method of private key management for end-users, especially in offline instances, which digital immunity passports would likely have to include, and say the VC specification merely “provides a data model, not a complete protocol or end-to-end solution.”

26416,2022-02-09 15:27:18,Should Everything be Downgraded?,"Climbing must be getting too easy. An abbreviated list of climbing headlines I read the other day included 3-year-old becomes youngest climber to send 9a; Indian Creek 5.13 offwidth sees 43 different sends in a single day; and Newest V17 in Colorado sees its first barefoot ascent. Personally, I still have a difficult time summiting my warmup most days, but some other climbers appear to have gotten just a little too good at this sport. Are all the rock climbs suddenly wicked soft, or has the collective climbing consciousness finally elevated itself to mastery by successfully sending every single benchmark Moonboard problem? Do we need to start downgrading everything ? In all seriousness, there's been increasing chatter on the Internet of gasp! downgrading some rigs thanks to the invention of knee pads and/or discovery of better beta and/or freakishly strong pros showing up and calling everything soft, and everyone and their ancient great grandmother seems to have an opinion on the issue of changing grades. Some folks are adamant that we remain faithful to the FA's assessment of difficulty, regardless of the fact that the climb went up before the invention of downturned climbing shoes or Friction Labs or rest days. Some think that if you're using adhesive spray to glue two pads on your freshly shaved thighs, you're ethically obligated to take fewer points for the send. Some new-agey types think that adhering to a single grade is offensive to the inherently vast range of human body types and physiological conditions. Mr. #tallnotstrong only gets to take V6 points for the reachy boulder while yours truly - at 5'2'' plus nothing - gets to log 8 big ones because she needs to dyno through the crux. ( Note: yours truly does not dyno through any cruxes and rather accepts defeat when too short for standard beta. ) Plus, the FA was a dude and therefore the original grade is an artifact of an oppressive and severely outdated patriarchy. Plus, sometimes gravity is high and shit's just hard. Story continues It’s undeniable that an individual climb can be harder or easier depending on your height, your ape index, your flexibility, your aptitude for finding knee bars, your shindex, the humidity, the temperature, the wind speed and direction, how long you've been doing your Lattice training program, your employment status, how much you numbed out on your warm-up, the number of beers you brought to the crag, how many dogs are barking in the background, the status of your Bitcoin investment, your hair color, how many episodes of Euphoria you watched last night, your astrological sign, the phase of the moon, the last time you showered, whether you've paid your taxes yet, the grade you got in 8 th -grade English, your capacity to consume gluten, how well your houseplants are doing, and your particular climbing strengths and weaknesses. So, should you downgrade the rock climb just because it felt really soft for you ? Alternatively, should you take more points because it was 95 degrees outside when you sent, and one other person logged it as a V11 instead of the guidebook-given-grade, V10? In the interest of settling this issue once and for all , I've made a quick quiz to help you figure out what grade you get for that V10: 1. How tall are you? A: Very short B: 5'2"" to 5'8"" C: 5'8"" to 6'3"" D: Very tall 2. What is your ape index? A: I have T-rex arms B: -1"" to +1"" C: +1"" to +3"" D: I can always reach the food on the top shelf 3. Did you use knee bars? A: Hell no B: Just one and it was pretty scummy C: Several D: I am actively sitting in a knee bar right now 4. Are you a Gemini? A: Yes B: No C: I don't know 5. Have you ever been to France? A: Yes B: No C: Je ne sais pas 6. What is the Fed's inflation target? A: Less than 2% B: 2%-2.5% C: 2.5-3% D: I'm going to eat a burrito for dinner 7. What are the Bokkenrijders? A: Swedish bandits who gather on the 5th new moon of each year to parade in their stolen attire B: Dutch ghosts who ride the backs of flying goats provided to them by demons C: Belgian cyclists who only ride whilst consuming Tripel Karmeliet D: Finnish sorcerers who dwell in an underwater paradise built by enslaved arctic char Let me quickly tally your score... Ok! It looks like you get to call this climb a V10, just like everyone else! Unfortunately, you don't get more points just because it was really hard. You also don't have to downgrade my project just because several eyewitnesses saw you using a knee bar on it last September. You are allowed to call it soft, but if I've learned anything from the several years that I've wasted reading absurdly long-winded Instagram sagas, it's that people get pretty upset when they're told that their project is soft. We all know that climbing grades are exceedingly subjective and that, on the whole, all the soft rock climbs we do are canceled out by all the sandbagged ones we don't do, and yet still the idea that our beloved project is ""soft"" is as triggering as an acne-laden pre-teen asking if they can do a warm-up lap on it - ""I promise! I'll be quick. I've done it 50 times."" So, anyway, you can call my project soft, but please do it out of earshot and - for the sake of my incredibly delicate self-esteem - please don't downgrade it. Now that we've settled, once and for all, whether or not we should be in the business of changing the historic, God-given grades assigned to all of the rock climbs, I'm going to go eat a burrito.

56862,2022-06-24 10:03:48,Hackers Steal $100 Million by Exploiting Crypto’s Weak Link,"(Bloomberg) -- Hackers looted about $100 million from a so-called cryptocurrency bridge, again exposing a key vulnerability in the digital-asset ecosystem.

Blockchain Harmony said in a tweet that the hack of its Horizon bridge, which lets people swap coins between different blockchains, took place Thursday morning. It has “begun working with national authorities and forensic specialists to identify the culprit and retrieve the stolen funds.”
Most of the crypto world is divided into silos: The Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, for example, can only operate using Bitcoin and Ethereum tokens. As more cryptocurrencies gain adoption and traders demand the ability to interact seamlessly with one another, projects like Harmony are developing platforms known as bridges that can accept a variety of tokens and move them fluidly between blockchains.
But bridges are particularly vulnerable to hacks, as their technology is complex and they are often run by anonymous teams. The way they safeguard funds is often unclear. Sophisticated hackers have repeatedly targeted them.
Harmony’s native ONE token, used to pay transaction fees, earn rewards or vote on changes to the platform, dropped 12% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. The underlying Harmony blockchain has more than $1 billion in total value locked to the project, according to its website.
It wasn’t immediately clear whether any user funds had been stolen.
‘Private Key Compromise’
The attack on Horizon, which offers cross-chain transfers between Ethereum and Binance’s Smart Chain, marks the third major bridge hack this year. In February, hackers stole more than $300 million from the Wormhole bridge, followed by a $620 million theft from the Ronin bridge a month later.
Even before to the Horizon hack, more than $1 billion had been stolen from bridges, researcher Chainalysis has estimated.
In Horizon’s case, “the theft seems to have happened due to a private key compromise,” said Xuxian Jiang, chief executive officer of security firm PeckShield, which has been contacted by Harmony for support. Harmony did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Horizon bridge is managed and secured by four wallets, Jiang said, and an authentication from at least two of the wallets -- each supported by multiple signatures -- is required to validate and execute a transaction. On this occasion, an attacker was able to compromise the private information required to access these wallets, and then trigger transactions that withdrew assets from the Horizon bridge to an external wallet, Jiang said.
The hackers made off with cryprocurrencies including Ether and BNB as well as stablecoins Tether, USDC and DAI, researcher Elliptic said in a tweet. Those tokens were then swapped for Ether using so-called decentralized exchanges in what Elliptic called “a commonly-seen technique with these hacks.”
Ronin Hack
Horizon uses a security mechanism similar to the one employed by the Ronin bridge, linked to the popular blockchain game Axie Infinity, which required five out of nine validators required to sign off at the time it was hacked. Harmony is popular for blockchain games like Mars Colony and DeFi Kingdoms, according to its website.
After the Ronin attack, which was attributed to a North Korean hacker group, owner Sky Mavis sharply increased the number of validators required to sign off on transactions -- pledging to eventually boost it to over 100.
Thursday’s attack on the Horizon bridge followed an exploit related to five user wallets on Harmony’s network in January, in which the company said a thief had siphoned 19,314,598 ONE tokens, worth roughly $5.8 million at the time.
The amount of money locked on bridges connected to the Ethereum blockchain declined 60% in the last 30 days to less than $12 billion, per tracker Dune, triggered by a wider crypto market slump and liquidity concerns surrounding several large crypto players including Celsius Network, Babel Finance, Three Arrows Capital and Voyager Digital.

They point to the ""steady, if somewhat slow, disinflation"" trend over the last several quarters and a Fed that appears ready to respond to any sign of reignited price pressures.""Fed commentary after the GDP and jobs data has been much less dovish, suggesting that policymakers are vigilant to upside risks,"" said the report.

45853,2021-11-03 16:39:00,Why Litecoin Will Keep Doing Well in 2022 and Beyond,"Litecoin(CCC:LTC-USD) is likely to do quite well over the next year. In fact, Litecoin is now the seventeenth-largest crypto in the world with a $13.8 billion market capitalization. LTC crypto will generally follow the path of other major cryptos likeBitcoin(CCC:BTC-USD) andEthereum(CCC:ETH-USD). It has shown a high correlation with these top cryptos.
Source: Shutterstock
For example, LTC crypto is up 58.5% so far this year, as of Nov. 2 at $200.04 per token. Similarly, Bitcoin is up a great deal during 2021 year-to-date (YTD). As of Nov. 2, it’s up 114.5% to $63,031.
Since Litecoin was meant to be an easier version of Bitcoin and was modeled after it, the performance will tend to follow the same direction. Granted, it hasn’t moved as high as Bitcoin, but it is not as well known and it does not have the same type of following as Bitcoin.
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Bitcoin has been the uncontestedcryptocurrency marketleader since it launched in 2009. But Litecoin,which launched in 2011, and was one of the early cryptos, has been tracking Bitcoin’s performance, albeit not as great, ever since then.
• 7 Stocks to Buy That Could Benefit From the Roaring Tesla Rally
For example, since Nov. 2 in 2019, in the past 2 years, Bitcoin is up 6.8 times from $9,235 per BTC token. Litecoin is also up, but not as much. It is now 3.25 times its price of $61.57 from two years ago.
In other words, given the YTD figures and the past 2 years’ performance, it appears that LTC crypto tracks Bitcoin’s, but with a 50% lag.
And why shouldn’t it? It was designed to be positioned as “a silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” according to itsfounder Charlie Lee in 2011. Silver has generally followed the upward trajectory as gold, but often it has underperformed.
For example, Litecoin has a similar feature as Bitcoin where its supply is reduced by half every several years. This helps keep the supply/demand curve for LTC crypto in balance with a bent toward an upward price as the supply of the Litecoin tokens falls.
However, Litecoin features some core changes, such as block times that are four times longer than Bitcoin. In addition, its supply cap is four times as large compared with BTC. So, again, it’s no wonder it has a 50% drag on its performance compared with Bitcoin.
Litecoin has been making news lately in the finance world. In a twist of old finance vs. new finance, Litecoin recently announcedvia a tweetthat it had teamed withVISA(NYSE:V) to issue a Litecoin debit card.
Litecoin’s virtual cardis the only card that stays in Litecoin. The Litecoin balance is converted at the time of purchase in a sufficient amount to cover a purchase with a merchant.
So all you have to do is fund your Litecoin Visa card with a balance in Litecoin. It is sort of like a “secured” debit card if you will. The difference is that you get to keep earning more value in dollars as the value of your Litecoin balance grows.
In fact, you can also deposit Bitcoin, Ethereum andRipple(CCC:XRP-USD) as well as Litecoin. Litecoin says that the LTC debit card can be used at all digital merchants that use Visa as their payment processor. They estimate this to be about 50 million merchants worldwide.
This is likely to shake up traditional finance as this kind of concept develops within the decentralized finance (Defi) universe.
For example, how long will it be before a mortgage company allows consumers to borrow money in Litecoin or another crypto? Payments might be made either in dollars or in the LTC or other crypto. This virtual Visa Litecoin debit card is just the precursor for something like this.
So, despite Litecoin’s lagging performance with Bitcoin, you can see that the currency still has some ingenious developments. These could help it make up the traditional 50% lag in performance vs. Bitcoin.
Investors in LTC might find this an opportune time to invest in LTC crypto as a result.

21136,2018-03-02 22:34:00,A Rough Week for Oil Stocks Makes This One an Even More Compelling Opportunity,"This past week has been a tough one for investors as the market took another tumble, fueled this time by trade war fears. Given that sentiment, it wasn't a good week to be reporting fourth-quarter earnings, which was the case for many oil stocks. Several got punished for reporting less-than-stellar numbers and outlooks, includingCalifornia Resources(NYSE: CRC),Carrizo Oil & Gas(NASDAQ: CRZO),Halcon Resources(NYSE: HK),Ultra Petroleum(NASDAQ: UPL), andBill Barrett(NYSE: BBG). While it's easy to justify most of those sell-offs, one stood out as not making any sense.
California Resources led the downdraft, tumbling 33% this week after reporting fourth-quarter results. While the California-focused oil producer didn't lose as much money during the quarter as feared, production declined 6.6% due to several issues, including wildfires in the state during December. On top of that, costs increased because of higher maintenance and energy expenses. Those issues showed that California Resources still has a long road to recovery ahead of it before it's back on solid ground.

Carrizo Oil & Gas, meanwhile,fellabout 24% this week after releasing its fourth-quarter report. While the oil stock also beat earnings expectations, its disappointing outlook overshadowed those results. The main issue was Carrizo's expectation that oilfield service costs would rise by double digits this year, which would slow down its production growth engine. While Carrizo Oil & Gas wasn't the only producer tocaution investors about service cost inflation, its smaller-scale operations made it harder for the company to offset the impact.
Halcon Resources slumped about 24% this week after reporting weak fourth-quarter results. The oil producer unveiled a much larger loss than expected due to a big spike in operating costs. The main culprit was the fact that Halcon sold its legacyBakken Shaleassets and no longer benefited from the scale it enjoyed from being a larger producer. While the company hopes to rebuild that scale by growing production from its retained assets, that will take time, which will weigh on profitability in the meantime.
Ultra Petroleumdeclinedabout 19% this week following the release of its fourth-quarter report. While Ultra reported expectation-beating earnings, its outlook disappointed. The company said it plans to slash spending 30% this year so it can generate free cash flow. That cut will hold back its ability to increase production, causing the company to grow at a slower rate than many rivals.

Bill Barrett also had a rough week, with the oil company's stocktumblingmore than 17%. That sell-off came in spite of the fact that the company reported a $1.1 million profit for the fourth quarter while analysts expected a loss. Investors, however, overlooked that result and instead focused on the company's outlook. Bill Barrett warned that due to a third-party infrastructure issue, production in the first quarter would remain flat with last quarter, which is a disappointment for a company that increased output 37% last year. Further, the company didn't provide a forecast beyond the first quarter.
That said, the reason Bill Barrett didn't give a longer-term outlook is that the company is in the process of merging with Fifth Creek Energy, which will significantly improve its balance sheet and scale. The company will probably provide a longer-term forecast after the deal closes later this month, which will likely show that the combined entity can deliver enhanced production and profit growth in the coming years.
Halcon, California Resources, Ultra, and Carrizo all sold off for understandable reasons since these smaller producers are still struggling in the aftermath of the oil market downturn. That said, it's harder to justify Bill Barrett's sell-off since it's about to become a much stronger company that should reaccelerate after getting past a temporary infrastructure issue in the first quarter. That's why I think Bill Barrett seems like an even morecompelling option for investorslooking for a fast-growing, though higher-risk, oil stock after selling off this week.

16093,2019-02-25 00:22:00,Crypto Tumble as Market Cap Loses $12 Billion,"Investing.com - Top cryptocurrencies saw their values suddenly tumble on Monday in Asia, recording double-digit losses after they seemingly picked up momentum last week. Market capitalisation shed $12 billion over the weekend. Bitcoin lost 9.23% to $3,819.5 by 12:21 AM ET (5:21 GMT). Ethereum plunged 17.44% to $139.79, XRP dived 12.15% to $0.30308, and Litecoin dropped 17.08% to $44.911. The crypto market cap dropped sharply from $141 billion last Saturday to $129 billion on Monday. But the market tumble has not deterred Japanese corporations from tapping into the crypto space. On Monday, Japanese financial giant Mizuho was said to be launching its new digital token J-Coin to offer cashless transactions. The firm is now reportedly working with around 60 financial partners to launch the digital token that will link existing bank accounts to new J-Coin wallets. Users will be able to make payments with their smartphones. Japanese news outlet Nikkei Asian Review said the platform is to launch on Friday. While Japan is keen to spearhead its crypto development, Korean regulators are still looking for cues from the U.S. about whether it plans to take further actions to regulate crypto assets. Speaking to The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity last week, an official of Korea Exchange said the bourse will see if U.S. regulators will greenlight Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “The U.S. has been the front-runner on the cryptocurrency market and related derivatives, and there are strong voices supporting the launch of Bitcoin ETFs within the market — which is why we are observing the progress and response of the U.S. [SEC]’s decision on Bitcoin ETFs,” the official said. The Korean bourse is looking into the feasibility of a Bitcoin index. The official was quoted saying that such ETFs “would eventually concern investor protection issues.” In other news, Russian financial outlet Rambler reported that the Russian State Duma is going to review and adopt new crypto regulations next month. The country ’s former Energy Minister Igor Yusufov also proposed an oil-backed digital token. Story continues “Perhaps the oil-backed cryptocurrency will be the pioneering project that will create a reliable structure for the cryptographic market as a whole,” Yusufov told Rambler.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin jumped to an 18-month high on Wednesday, as investors looked for safety in alternative investments amid geopolitical tension, and cheered prospects that Facebook Inc's Libra token could push cryptocurrencies into the mainstream.
The world's biggest cryptocurrency has surged in value since April and on Wednesday hit a peak of $13,666.02 on the Bitstamp exchange, the highest level since January 2018. So far this year, bitcoin has risen more than 260%, although it remains below its all-time high of nearly $20,000 hit in December 2017.
Bitcoin last traded up 14.7% at $13,475.
Investors have flocked back in to digital currencies after a bruising 2018. Bitcoin has risen for eight consecutive days. And now Facebook has said it would offer its own cryptocurrency, the Libra coin, by end of June 2020.
Analysts say Facebook's announcement this month has revived interest in digital currencies, while investors seeking safety have also pushed up bitcoin's price.
""Cryptocurrency traders were reinvigorated by Facebook's launch of their own digital coin and momentum appears to be stirring up fresh new investors,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst, at online FX broker OANDA in New York.
""Bitcoin skeptics are cautious in trying to stop this surge and may look for the next key resistance level which is $15,000,"" he added.
With major central banks keeping interest rates near all-time lows, investors have been looking for ways to diversify their portfolios, including through cryptocurrenies, analysts said.
Bitcoin CME futures volumes have also increased in the past few days, as investors look for ways to get their hands on the coin via the derivatives market.
Traders, who have access to both spot and futures markets have been buying the spot and selling the futures, arbitraging the two prices, said Michael Moro, chief executive officer at Genesis Global Trading, which provides over-the-counter digital currency trading for institutional investors.
The cryptocurrency has rocketed 150% since early May, along with big rises in other smaller digital currencies such as Ethereum's ether and Ripple's XRP.
""It should be noted that this a very different market today than it was in 2017,"" said Moro.
""2017 saw an overwhelming number of ICOs (initial coin offerings), which was very distracting. 2019 has less distractions. It's also a different space because the CME bitcoin futures product wasn't available until December 2017.""
ICOs refer to a fundraising scheme that bypasses banks and venture capital firms and involves startups creating their own tokens and selling them to the public.

6792,2019-12-11 18:15:03,When Might Bitcoin Be Ready To Resume Its Bull Trend?,"Two weeks ago, Bitcoin completed a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement ($7,231.40) off the June high as it fell to a low of $6,526. That low put it 52.9% below the 2019 peak.
Bull Flag pattern
The price correction since the June high has been normal and well-constructed, forming a potential bull flag trend continuation pattern. This can be seen as the falling parallel trend channel in the enclosed charts.
BTC/USD Weekly Chart
Given the significant advance in the first half of the year, and the related signs of a trend change from bearish to bullish, Bitcoin has a good chance of eventually triggering a continuation of the new bull trend. The 2019 rally exceeded several prior swing highs and the 10-week exponential moving average (ema) crossed back above the 34-week ema.
Have we seen the bottom?
The question now is, has the bottom of the retracement been reached or might Bitcoin pullback further than it has so far? There’s no way to know this ahead of time but we can identify some important price levels to watch going forward.
As long as price stays above the $6,526 swing low, there is a chance for an upside breakout of the bull flag. If the falling trend channel is to further evolve and retain its general shape, a move up to at least the top trend line seems possible in the near-term.
BTC/USD Daily Chart
A decisive daily close above the downtrend line is the first sign that a bullish breakout of the flag could be in the works. At that point, additional signs of strength will be needed. Watch for a daily close above the most recent swing high of $10,540.49 for confirmation of a bullish breakout. There is also a monthly high at $9,600 from November. Bitcoin has not had a move above a prior month high since the June peak. A move above a prior month high would be an additional sign of a change in the downtrend pattern, to an uptrend.
If we see further weakness
Alternatively, notice that the 10-week ema has just crossed below the 34-week ema, after being above it since early-May. By itself this is bearish, and supports a bearish scenario if Bitcoin falls below the most recent swing low, thereby triggering a continuation of the downtrend off the 2019 high. If that occurs, next watch for signs of support around the $5,900 to $5,427 (78.6% Fibonacci retracement) price zone, and then for indications of a bottom and subsequent bullish reversal.

Speaking to Rob Nelson on TheStreetRoundtable, Booth explained that AI isn’t just a technological revolution — it’s also a political and economic one. “AI literally will take jobs away… but it will create lower prices. It will create more economies,” Rob said. Booth agreed, but warned that the real danger is who controls the AI.
“The giant AI companies are looking for regulation… because it protects the monopoly,” Booth said. “You should be very scared of AI in the existing system… Somebody will control everything you do.”
He named Google, Amazon, and China as examples of centralized entities collecting massive amounts of data. “They're in cahoots with the government… to be able to control this,” Booth said, arguing that people turning to the government for help are only feeding the cycle.
The alternative? Bitcoin.
“In the natural state of the free market, prices fall to the marginal cost of production,” Booth said. That’s why calculator apps are free today—because software has almost no cost to reproduce.
As AI and robotics get cheaper and more widespread, Booth believes prices for goods and services will collapse. “AI is free. It will be free everywhere,” he said. And companies that don’t use it will get left behind.
That’s where Bitcoin comes in. “If you had an energy-backed protocol, decentralized and secure, that you couldn’t change, that humans couldn’t cheat… prices would fall forever,” Booth explained. “You’d be living in the first global free market that has ever existed.”",84993.62,-0.02,84956.79,-0.06,85033.13,0.03,85213.34,0.24,85008.13

Ross Ulbricht
The IRS recently ruled thatBitcoin is property, not a ""monetary instrument."" And now the attorney for alleged Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht is arguing that his client must be innocent of money laundering because Bitcoin officially isn't money,reports Wired.
Silk Road was the anonymous marketplace for drugs and weaponry favored by the internet's Bitcoin black market.
Attorney Joshua Dratel wrote a memo calling for a dismissal of some charges against Ulbricht, stating that ""both IRS and FinCEN ha ve categorically declared that Bitcoins are not 'funds.' Thus, an essential element of §1956 — a 'financial transaction' — is absent because a necessary component thereof — either 'funds' or 'monetary instruments' — is lacking. Consequently, it is respectfully submitted that Count Four must be dismissed.""
Ulbricht was indicted in both New York and Maryland, and these potential dismissals would only slightly alleviate Ulbricht's legal situation as they only apply in New York.
Even if they were dropped, there's still one narcotics conspiracy charge, one count of running a criminal enterprise, and one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking. Dratel is moving for these to be dismissed as well, citing them as ""unconstitutionally vague.""

32781,2018-05-23 01:40:00,Genesys Fund - Explores the Growing Government Interest in Cryptocurrencies,"PORT VILA, VANUATU / ACCESSWIRE / May 22, 2018 /Cryptocurrencies are often hailed as the most revolutionary technological development since the creation of the World Wide Web. During their relatively short existence, digital coins have managed to take the market by storm, triggering an investment frenzy that pushed the price of the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, to the staggering $20,000 in December 2017. As the crypto space evolved, cautious voices started noting that virtual money needed stability and regulatory safeguards before it could become an accepted means of payment and investment. The proponents of cryptocurrencies never miss an opportunity to highlight the benefits of blockchain, the technology that underpins most virtual coins, and to accuse the mainstream financial system of aversion to Bitcoin and its peers because of their decentralized nature. But as leading portfolio management solutions providerGenesys Fundpoints out, governments around the world are not blind to the opportunities presented by digital money. While they may not be willing to approve one of the existing crypto coins as legal tender, the central banks of several countries are experimenting with the concept of a state-backed digital currency, and such projects could have a profound impact on the global monetary system.
In 2015, Ecuador becamethe first countryto introduce national virtual money, but it was more an electronic payment system than a cryptocurrency per se. The Ecuadorean government said at the time the initiative was intended to support the US dollar-based monetary system, as well as to deliver cost-savings and enhance social support measures in the Latin American nation. That same year,Tunisia announcedit would use blockchain to create a digital version of its national currency, emerging as the first country in the world to do so.Senegal became the secondearly in 2017. However, Venezuela is one of the first countries to launch what could be termed a proper cryptocurrency. President Nicolas Maduro unveiled his plan late in 2017, saying the government would issue El Petro - a digital coin backed by Venezuela's oil reserves. According to the latest reports, the public sale of the digital tokens attracted investors from 127 countries andraised $5 billionfor Venezuela. Several other countries are considering the launch of state-sanctioned cryptocurrencies, among them Sweden, Estonia, China, Russia, Japan, the UK, Uruguay, and Israel.
Due to their decentralized nature and the anonymity they provide, digital coins have raised concerns over their potential to facilitate security issues. However, the underlying technology provides benefits that many governments seem eager to exploit,Genesys Fundnotes. The combination of blockchain and state-approved virtual money offers the promise of nearly instant and transparent money transfers. Sovereign cryptocurrencies would also promote the inclusion of currently unbanked segments of the population through mobile payment systems. In addition, they could enhance public services by improving delivery, while also increasing the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of monetary policy regulation.

45083,2022-11-04 19:53:58,US-China Friction Gives Kim Jong Un the Freedom to Fire Away,"(Bloomberg) -- North Korea’s unprecedented barrage of missiles is underscoring the cost of Washington’s tensions with Beijing, since China has shown little appetite for additional sanctions over the country’s nuclear program. Most Read from Bloomberg Lawyer Suing Twitter Over Layoffs Says Musk Trying to Comply Putin’s Ukraine War Is Entering a Terrifying New Phase China to ‘Unswervingly’ Keep to Covid Zero Policy, Dashing Hopes Wells Fargo Faces US Demand for Record Fine Exceeding $1 Billion Carvana’s 96% Collapse Erases Billions From Father-Son Duo’s Wealth China, along with Russia, played a critical role in approving United Nations sanctions on their neighbor after Kim Jong Un tested an atomic bomb and launched a missile designed to carry warheads to the US five years ago. There’s little prospect of finding such unity on the UN Security Council now, even though North Korea has fired about 100 ballistic missiles since the UN approved its last penalties in 2017. The Biden administration has shown increasing frustration with China, which has long been North Korea’s most important benefactor. And the stakes are rising because the US and its allies believe Kim’s regime is preparing to detonate a nuclear bomb for the first time in five years. The US sought to make another run at support for fresh measures against North Korea at a Security Council meeting Friday afternoon in New York. Beijing and Moscow have resisted US-led efforts to expand sanctions in recent years, arguing that Kim deserves relief for gestures he made before his unprecedented -- but ultimately unsuccessful -- summits with former President Donald Trump. US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said North Korea had “enjoyed blanket protection” from two members of the council -- a thinly veiled reference to Russia and China. “You don’t get to abandon Security Council responsibilities because the DPRK might sell you weapons to fuel your war of aggression in Ukraine, or because you think they make a good regional buffer to the United States,” Thomas-Greenfield told the Security Council, using the abbreviation for North Korea’s formal name. Story continues In his speech, China’s ambassador to the UN, Zhang Jun made clear his government’s stance that the US, not North Korea, was responsible for the latest tension. He cited recent military exercises by the US and South Korea as needlessly inflammatory. “We call on the US to stop unilaterally playing up tensions and confrontation,” Zhang said. He said the US should “demonstrate sincerity by earnestly responding to the legitimate and reasonable concerns” of North Korea. More recently, US President Joe Biden has sanctioned Russia and sought to isolate its leader Vladimir Putin to halt its war in Ukraine. The administration has also warned Chinese leader Xi Jinping that he risks secondary sanctions if he helps Moscow, even as Washington and Beijing clash over everything from Taiwan to microchips. Those disputes have given Kim a freer hand to expand his nuclear program and build a more credible deterrent to prevent any US strike against the regime. North Korea’s tests have demonstrated a wide array of new missiles and launching platforms that appear intended to evade detection and interception by the US. “North Korea knows the recent provocations won’t trigger any new UN resolutions,” said Maiko Takeuchi, a former member of a UN Security Panel of Experts set up to monitor sanctions on North Korea. If current sanctions were strictly implemented, that would also “seriously damage the regime’s activity and economy,” she said. The sanctions regime, which, among other things, includes a cap on fuel imports and limits on foreign income, has shown cracks. North Korea was on track to exceed its 500,000-barrel cap of annual imports this year, a Panel of Experts report released in September said. In addition, an oil pipeline between Dandong, China, and Sinuiju, North Korea, that was exempted from sanctions could be supplying more than 3.7 million barrels of oil each year, according to a report from specialists David von Hippel and Peter Hayes. Kim has also found ways to evade sanctions through cybercrimes and cryptocurrency theft. Investigators from the US and UN have said his regime has already taken in hundreds of millions of dollars in assets through online schemes, and is poised to rake in even more. The North Korean leader has repeatedly rebuffed US overtures to return to talks, reiterating in September that he would “never give up nuclear arms or denuclearize first.” Instead, he has rebuilt once-frayed ties with China and Russia -- whom both wield vetoes on the Security Council. Xi has recently reaffirmed his desire to maintain “strategic” talks with Kim. And the Biden administration has accused North Korea of covertly supplying Russia with artillery shells for use in the Ukraine invasion, something North Korea has denied. Without necessary support for UN sanctions, the US and South Korea have sought to deter North Korea from any more aggressive moves, jointly warning it that using a nuclear weapon against them would “result in the end of the Kim regime.” They also extended allied air force exercises in the region. One indication of Chinese support for additional sanctions will be its response to any North Korean nuclear test, especially after Xi told visiting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday that the international community must “reject the use or threat of the use of nuclear weapons.” China denounced North Korea’s last test in September 2017, expressing “firm opposition to and strong condemnation” of it. North Korea may be banking that China won’t be so critical the next time. Kim’s actions indicate a broader shift away from the country’s long-term goal of normalizing ties with Washington as a buffer against Beijing and Moscow, said Rachel Minyoung Lee, who worked as an analyst for the CIA’s Open Source Enterprise for almost two decades. “The true import of this policy shift extends beyond just North Korea’s pivot to China and Russia,” Lee wrote in a commentary published on the 38 North website. “It signals a more fundamental transformation in Pyongyang’s position on relations with Washington.” --With assistance from Iain Marlow.

“The matter was escalated to Twitter and the account has been immediately secured,” the Prime Minister’s office said in a tweet early Sunday. “In the brief period that the account was compromised, any Tweet shared must be ignored.”
During the time the account was compromised, a tweet was sent falsely saying that India had officially adopted Bitcoin as the legal tender, and that the country has bought the digital currency which it would distribute to citizens.
In late November, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government had no proposal to recognize Bitcoin as a currency in the country.

42714,2022-07-25 22:04:28,7 Small-Cap Growth Stocks to Buy on the Dip,"Buying stocks on a dip seems a credible investment idea. The goal of investing is to either buy low and sell high, or to sell high — going short — and buy lower to cover your positions. Finding small-cap growth stocks to buy on the dip appear to be riskier than buying large-cap stocks during those pullbacks. But remember that opportunities exist all the time across all industries, sectors and sizes of companies.
These small-cap growth stocks to buy on the dip present not only growth in revenue and EPS, but they have attractive valuations and solid fundamentals.
Buying a stock at a steep discount is worthless if the fundamentals of the company are bad. Such a move is pure speculation with very low odds of success.

52382,2021-08-23 22:15:00,Robinhood’s Lessons For ETF Issuers,"[ETF Pulse appears Mondays and Thursdays. Drew Voros is Editor-in-Chief of ETF.com.]
“At the end of the day, I fight for those who cannot fight for themselves. If that makes me an outlaw, so be it. I’ve been called worse.” —Robin Hood, circa 1400 England lore
Robinhood, the merry ole Nottingham-named brokerage firm that just went public is now worth $48 billion of Wall Street lunch money. There was no theft, just chump change left on the sidewalk, because Wall Street didn’t want to bother to stoop down to pick up the nickels and dimes.
Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt founded Robinhood in 2013, thinking they might be able to scoop up those nickels and dimes left by retail investors by offering free commissions and no minimum deposits.
So the very non-Wall Street Dynamic Duo easily walked right through the open castle gates, bringing neglected and dismissed retail traders and do-it-yourself investors who don’t consider a financial advisor … until they need tax and family estate planning from their well-researched trades and portfolio management you can learn at home.
Ignore Retail At Your Peril
The little startup from Menlo Park, 3,000 miles away from Wall Street, slowly kicked and crawled its way onto the radar of retail investors. It was a slow move onto those radars in the early years, but suddenly, eight years later, the firm has gone from a Silicon Valley pipedream to a $48 billion brokerage that’s disrupting the Old Guard gravy train, much like ETFs have done to mutual funds.
Robinhood’s success simply lay in providing easy and free access to the financial markets to retail investors with no trading dollar minimums or costs, and all the ETFs you would like—even cryptocurrencies, because that’s what the people want.
That’s something the Old Guard had seemingly no interest in doing, until recently, or until when Robinhood sprang into action in 2013. The idea of free commissions across the board for retail investors seemed fantastical back then, but hardly so today.
The dismantling of the fixed trading commissions of the pre-1975 era unleashed the beginning of the “race to zero” for trading commissions. But there was noraceto zero by the Old Guard on Wall Street. It was more like a slow shuffle, pushed mostly by Charles Schwab, which went public as a brokerage 44 years ago, followed by E-Trade and TD Ameritrade.
E-Trade and the likes of TD Ameritrade, which now owns Scottrade, were haplessly labeled at the time as the new threat to the Wall Street Gravy Train. In reality, these disruptors were bringing a knife to a gunfight. Pre-2000, the commoner couldn’t access trading without paying something, no matter your online savvy or access. The Lords of Wall Street were still collecting a tidy sum.
A $50 commission to trade online back in the day was a steal. Today it’s highway robbery.
Old Wall Street Invented Order Flow Payments
Robinhood customers’ trade order flow is the main source of revenue for the firm. Market makers arbitrage your trade. Scary? It shouldn't be. Wall Street invented that—with worse intentions than free commissions. But that’s been acceptable, and for the most part, an understood trade-off for Robinhood clients for zero commissions and tight trading spreads.
And unlike most of Wall Street brokerages, Robinhood has been clear as day that it is paid for its trading order flow. The Old Guard invented payment flow to enhance the revenue stream from high commissions and fees for transferring your money to the brokerage and back. It just kept that revenue stream buried among the other brokerage skeletons.
Overlooking The Trees
One of the oddest wrinkles of the ETF industry—and particularly on the issuer side—is a steady beat of aversion away from retail investors. While marketing and focusing on the advisors and wealth managers, the ETF issuers are ignoring the trees in the forest.
We hear it on our side of the ETF media business: “We don’t want any retail, just advisors” for online events, which sometimes make sense, but is always underestimation of the biggest leg of growth currently carrying the ETF industry.
Today you can’t paint “retail investors” with any kind of broad brushstroke. They range in size from the kids on Robinhood to the Apple software engineers who are do-it-yourself multimillionaire investors from their company stocks and 401(k)s that they don’t touch.
“I think that the heavily indexed or benchmark approach to investing is ripe for change and I think that the retail investor, the individual investor, is actually leading the charge,”said Cathie Wood, Founder and CEO of Ark Invest, during the Cboe Exchanging Perspectives webinar back in Marchand reported on by CNBC.
Compliance Jitters Blur Adaptation
We don’t outlaw guns because people shoot themselves accidentally or not. The long lines for lottery tickets never put anybody upon a wall of worry that Americans dump some $100 billion a year in U.S. lottery sales. Maybe that’s because the state governments sell those tickets.
The fear of compliance and ignorant investors wandering into big losses is what I think is at the heart of why ETF issuers and much of Wall Street restrict marketing, advertising—and more importantly, product education to blue collar investors.
Unintended consequences of the “retail not welcome at our products” is that these investors simply find somewhere to invest, like Bitcoin, NBA Top Shot, NFT artwork, etc. More alternative, non-Wall Street investment products are being created every day.
When fools—big or small—and their money part ways, there is the assumption that something is wrong with the ETF product. That’s rarely the case. The products functioned properly. The investor didn’t know how to use the financial tool properly and got hurt—advisor, broker or DIY operator error, more likely.
Waking The Old Guard
Robinhood reached way back in history for its startup name. The disruptors of Nottingham Forest in circa 14thcentury are waking the Old Guard from its nap.
For ETF issuers, the retail crowd seems to be a love-them-or-leave-them affair. Many issuers like ARK do acknowledge and seek the retail investors.
And there are plenty of others such as ETF Managers Group, with its marijuanaETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ), topping $1.2 billion in assets under management; Roundhill Investments with itsRoundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF (BETZ)with nearly $400 million in AUM in a little more than a year; and sleeper ETF hit of 2020, theU.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS)from U.S. Global Investors, which saw its AUM jump from $40 million in February 2020 to $3.2 billion, fueled by social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube.
If nothing else, ETF issuers with an aversion to the retail crowd need to study that class of investors more closely. They’re smarter than you may think.

Finance media company The Street announced on April 5, 2021, that it would be launching a new brand focusing exclusively on cryptocurrency. The Street also intends to devote more media coverage on its website to cryptocurrency news.
Rob Barrett, who recently became president of The Street’s parent company Maven Media, stated that the decision reflects growing interest in alternative currency across the world. Additions to The Street’s website include:
• A channel dedicated only to news about cryptocurrency
• Newsletter titledCrypto Investorcovering stories about the growing acceptance of Bitcoin on Wall Street
The Streetwill offer the cryptocurrency newsletter on a subscription basis while access to its dedicated channel remains free.
How The Street is Ramping Up to Offer Expansive Coverage of Cryptocurrency
Rob Barrett has led the development of bringing on a new team of journalists, all of whom have extensive experience covering the alternative currency market. Barrett intends to position The Street as aleader in finance mediaby providing extensive cryptocurrency resources on the company’s website. The Street also hopes to capitalize on the mistakes other finance media companies have made in ignoring the growing acceptance of cryptocurrency.
The Street’s new president stated that his intention is for the new dedicated channel to cover events and information in the finance world as they happen. The newsletter will offer more in-depth articles for people interested in learning more about the cryptocurrency market.
About Rob Barrett
Rob Barrett began his new position as president with Maven Media in late February. All media brands and editorial teams at The Street andSports Illustrated,another Maven Media publication, will report to him directly. Rob Barrett will report toRoss Levinsohn, the CEO of Maven Media.
Prior to coming on board with Maven Media, Rob Barrett held the position of president with the digital media group Hearst. He previously worked with Ross Levinsohn in the news and finance division of Yahoo where Levinsohn was head of media and interim CEO.

The main challenge forSports Illustratedis that subscriptions to its print media have fallen by over one million people in a 19-month period from May 2019 to December 2020. The popular sports magazine has recently added a digital subscription that is performing even better than expected. Rob Barrett expected this when he became president and will work with his teams to determine howSports Illustratedcan continue to serve both customer groups well.
The Street grew its revenue by 30 percent in 2020 with predictions for an even better 2021. Barrett states that he intends to grow the number of advertisers and subscribers for both companies.

• Bitcoin Cash could close 2018 trading below $200.
Bitcoin Cashhas proved to the investors that it has the ability to reverse a downtrend significantly. This comes after the digital asset corrected from the lows formed around $73.36 to highs around $229.65 in less than one week.
The upside retracement is likely due to the stability the network is nurturing following the hard fork on November 15. The upgrade saw Bitcoin Cash chain split into two separate chains. Bitcoin ABC assumed the symbol BCH while the other chain, Bitcoin SV in the leadership of the former Bitcoin Cash developer, Craig Wright. The hash war and the trade wars between the chains has cooled down as both networks focus on development.
In the meantime, Bitcoin Cash is trading at $165 following a correction from the monthly high. Bitcoin Cash investors received an early Christmas gift with the fueled and incredible recovery. However, as the players in the mark took time to spend Christmas away from the digital assets, Bitcoin Cash slashed the gains accrued first breaking below the rising trendline and later forming a bearish flag pattern.
Consequently, the bears grip continued the price broke beneath the above mention pattern, see chart. At the moment, the 50 Simple Moving Average is limiting gains at169.67. Similarly, further correction to the upside will face high seller concentration at $180 (the 100 SMA). BCH/USD needs to correct above the 100 SMA for a breakout above $200. On the other hand, the technical indicators on the chart show reduced buyer activity, which means that Bitcoin Cash could close 2018 trading below $200. On matters concerning support zones, the first one is at $160, the second at $150 (this week’s low) and a stronger support highlighted by the 38.2% Fib retracement level as observed on the chart.

The technical charts suggest further downside is likely as sellers react to extreme overbought conditions since March. Over the short term, bitcoin remains in a consolidation phase between $30,000 support and $40,000 resistance. Oftentimes, trading ranges can be difficult to navigate for some traders. “Chinese market participants have been massively selling during the past month alongside the Grayscale unlocking schedule leading to more selling pressure,” wrote Elie Le Rest, partner and co-founder of ExoAlpha, a crypto hedge fund, in an email to CoinDesk. Greyscale, like CoinDesk, is a unit of Digital Currency Group. “With newcomers in the crypto market seeing their profit and capital getting wiped out by selling waves, newcomers are taking their losses as they can’t stomach this much negative volatility anymore,” wrote Le Rest. Related: Crypto Long &#038; Short: This Bear Market May Not Last Long Traders are also grappling with the potential for tighter monetary policy in the U.S. this year, which could weigh on risk assets including cryptocurrencies. “Wall Street will have to see a couple more inflation and labor reports before having a better understanding on when the [Federal Reserve] will taper and be poised to raise interest rates,” wrote Edward Moya , senior market analyst at Oanda, in an email to CoinDesk. Story continues “It seems it will take intensifying inflation pressures to get the dollar rally going and that might pose one of the key risks for cryptocurrencies this summer,” wrote Moya. Institutions embrace crypto Despite short-term price swings, institutions are gradually warming to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin trading volumes on the LMAX Digital spot exchange have surged over the past year. Because LMAX Digital “facilitates trades for institutions only and already is among the leading bitcoin spot exchanges, this depicts the current institutionalization of the bitcoin market,” according to a report by Arcane Research and LMAX Digital published on Friday. The report also mentioned that roughly 70% of the 77 institutional investors surveyed by LMAX Digital expect asset managers, funds and banks to be the most significant contributors to trading volume in the next three years. However, several gaps remain, which could slow the pace of widespread institutional adoption. “Access to banking has been particularly highlighted by brokers, while proprietary trading firms and HFT [high frequency trading] firms see access to credit as a big gap. Notably, corporates see a lack of global regulation as a major concern,” according to LMAX Digital. Bitcoin hashrate declines It appears that China’s regulatory crackdown has accelerated the decline in bitcoin’s hashrate over the past month. The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power that is being used to mine and process transactions on the blockchain. Bitcoin’s mean hashrate has dropped to 104 EH/s, the lowest level since June 2020, according to data from Glassnode. BitOoda, a digital asset financial services platform, predicted the target hashrate would be around 105 EH/s at the next difficulty reset, which will likely happen on July 3, while the target hashrate will drop further to 85 EH/s at the subsequent difficulty reset on July 19 or July 20. Chinese miners have been looking for hosting sites for potential migration. “We’re seeing a ton of inbound requests from China-based mining companies that are looking to relocate to North America and are looking to do it urgently,” Dave Perrill, CEO of crypto mining colocation company Compute North, told CoinDesk.

29434,2021-03-22 11:45:04,The Morning After: Brazil wants in-box chargers with new iPhones,"Getting rid of smartphone excess is hard.Just ask Apple. When it launched the iPhone 12 series without chargers or headphones in the box, the company had to immediately accommodate French laws byincluding Earpodswith the four new smartphones. French law demands that smartphones are bundled with a hands-free kit or headset to protect children aged 14 and younger from electromagnetic radiation, with the country wary about the health effects of long-term radiation exposure from smartphones.
A little later,here’s Brazil. Consumer protection agency Procon-SP has fined Apple nearly R$10.55 million (about $1.92 million) for removing the power adapter from its newest phones, including later production runs of older iPhones. Procon-SP told Apple about the alleged violation in December, with the company reiterating its environmental angle, arguing that it would reduce CO2 emissions and rare earth mining, as well as the fact that many customers already had spare chargers. (Don’t forget that the in-box cable, with its USB-C connector, would need a new charger to work.)
The agency wasn’t satisfied with that answer, issuing a fine that is incredibly tiny given the size of Apple. The bigger issue now is how Apple will accommodate Brazil’s demands to ensure it can keep selling iPhones there.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has fined Coinbase $6.5 million for allegedly providing misleading info about its trading volumes. The Coinbase Pro exchange ran two programs that sometimes traded Bitcoin and Litecoin with each other between 2015 and 2018, and included those trades in data it shared with outside services, suggesting more trading volume than there was.
Coinbase is one of the most well-established cryptocurrency exchanges, simplifying the process of converting established currencies into Bitcoin and the rest. CFTC Commissioner Dawn Stump stressed that Coinbase's infractions were firmly in the past. The activity took place ""several years ago,"" and the employee responsible left years before the fine. The exchange hadn't repeated this behavior since, Stump added.Continue reading.

20192,2021-03-10 08:20:00,The Potential and Promise of Epicenter: Delivering on Bitcoin’s Original Vision,"SHERIDAN, Wyo., March 10, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Although the Epicenter ecosystem and its cryptocurrency,Epic Cash, have been known to veteran crypto enthusiasts for some time, it remains among the best kept secrets within the broader DeFi industry. Launched in September of 2019, Epic Cash is modeled after Bitcoin, with a pre-defined emission schedule and the same hard limit on the total coin supply; however, it has several design improvements and significant advantages over the “Founding Father” of the cryptocurrency movement.
Bitcoin today is clearly the top dog in the cryptocurrency universe. It is the standard for accessibility, trust, security, and transferability, against which all other digital currencies are measured. Although it has well-documented shortcomings, such as a concentration of power in centralized exchanges, increasing fees, and volatility, it will no doubt remain the market leader for the foreseeable future. So how does Epic Cash measure up against Bitcoin?
The Foundation of the Epicenter EcosystemThe Epicenter ecosystem was designed to address the flaws inherent in Bitcoin, so as to deliver on Nakamoto’s original vision, in which large numbers of small transactions are processed efficiently, anonymously and securely on a decentralized network of lightweight nodes.
With its triumvirate of digital assets – EPIC (Epic Cash), EUSD (soft-pegged stable coin) and ECR (reserve token) – the Epicenter ecosystem combines a store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account to deliver the solid monetary platform that decentralized finance requires.
EPIC addresses all of the attributes needed to foster mass adoption: fungibility, scalability, censorship resistance, centralization resistance and regulatory compatibility. To ensure fungibility, EPIC leverages the Confidential Transactions (CT) and CoinJoin technologies to scramble transaction details, resetting the ownership history each time coins are spent, thereby preventing tainted coins. For scalability, EPIC’s light, mobile-native protocol allows for a predominantly Layer-1 scaling model. With regard to centralization issues, EPIC can be mined on ordinary home computers, leveling the playing field for small-scale miners.
Epicenter provides an integrated and connected ecosystem of composable components with multi-chain connectivity. This unique connectivity feature provides developers with the tools they need to build decentralized applications. Epicenter allows for flexible, decentralized finance solutions, including lending, staking, swapping, payments and future features, all enabled with crypto-to-fiat convertibility.
Storage, Ease of Use, and ConvertibilityThe size of the Bitcoin blockchain has been an issue for some time and the problem is only getting worse. Bitcoin cannot be readily mined or stored on mobile phones, nor on most PCs. In contrast, by using the Mimblewimble protocol, EPIC is able to run natively on low-end mobile devices. A full node requires less than 1.2 GB – about 1/10thof the storage space required for Bitcoin. Improved Layer-1 technology allows EPIC to achieve much faster transaction speeds.
While there is increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by retail investors, institutions and businesses as a whole, cryptocurrency users still face difficulty in using it for real-world transactions. To address this problem, Epicenter introduced EUSD. EUSD is a stable coin that is soft-pegged, one-to-one, to the U.S. dollar: it is instantly convertible to the dollar equivalent of Epic Cash. EUSD is attractive for commercial applications because its fees are very small and the risk of fraud is non-existent.
Token SupplyEPIC has a fixed total supply of 21 million coins, and more than half of those coins have already been mined. With a strong future halving policy, scarcity will be guaranteed, in marked contrast to fiat currency, whose supply is unconstrained and constantly accelerating.
With regard to ECR, an initial circulating supply of 25 million tokens will be generated, with a one-to-one matching to the ~11 million units of Epic Cash that will exist when an ownership snapshot takes place later this quarter. On that date, each owner of Epic Cash will be able to claim a corresponding amount of ECR. The remaining ~14 million ECR tokens will be allocated to ecosystem partners, advisors and investors, to create a core group with “skin in the game,” motivated to see that the community as a whole is successful.
Conclusion
Epic Cash shows true promise in delivering on Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision for Bitcoin, as expressed in the seminal 2008 whitepaper. Epicenter holds that, with increased mining and ease of use, large numbers of secure transactions can be processed daily without the supervision of a centralized authority. With its related assets of EUSD and ECR, EPIC has the potential to become Bitcoin re-mastered.

57576,2021-11-17 13:49:25,Bitcoin (BTC) Holders Can Purchase A $29M Commercial Property In NY,"Bitcoin (BTC) adoption keeps spreading significantly across many sectors of the economy, including real estate, where the first commercial property in New York was put on sale in the crypto market.
The deal is a millionaire one because Magnum Real Estate Group issellingthree retail condos for about $29 million worth in the world’s largest crypto by market capitalization.
However, the location is also not unconventional, as it’s a new construction luxury residential building in Manhattan.
The masterminds behind selling the property argued that real estate’s demand is rising, and they found a way to take the best from it by listing the real estate in cryptocurrencies. “Our idea is to offer something that’s unique and try to pair the holders ofcryptowith those who want to sell real estate,” the firm noted.
Ben Shaoul, managing partner of Magnum Real Estate Group, clarified that this was not his first crypto-related deal with real estate, as he arranged three residential sales of condos in the Upper East Side for $15.3 million worth in Bitcoin.
One of the key points he highlighted about accepting cryptos to arrange property deals is that BTC is at record highs compared to some months ago, but also the philosophy of crypto holders as a means of savings to later use these profits to purchase real estate.
In addition, Sahoul pointed out that even the seller could benefit from the transaction because the crypto’s value could increase further.
All crypto transactions with Magnum Real Estate Group are performed through BitPay’s wallets, as the firm just receives the money converted in fiat dollars. In fact, BitPay noted that it had inked deals with luxury card dealers, global yacht brokers, among others.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin is recovering from the strong sell-off witnessed recently below the $60,000 critical handle after hitting a congestion zone formed by the volume profile. Now, it seems that the price is poised to retest the 200-period simple moving average at the H4 chart.
If buyers gain steam above $64,000, the price could gather momentum and eventually hit the resistance zone of $66,000. However, if it breaks below $58,000, doors will open for a leg lower’s extension towards the $54,000 level in a first degree.

78074,2022-03-30 09:43:29,Billionaire bond king Bill Gross calls meme stocks GameStop and AMC lottery tickets - and says there's no real value behind them,"• Investing legend Bill Gross compared meme stocks GameStop and AMC to lottery tickets.
• Both companies have ""very little"" behind them, and their stocks will fall, he told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.
• Gross said millennial retail traders simply believe that stocks go up, and think they deserve double-digit gains.
Legendary investor Bill Gross is still betting Reddit darlingsGameStopandAMCwill tumble, despite their recent comeback.
""I simply think that AMC and GameStop are lottery tickets,"" the Pimco cofounder toldYahoo Financein a Tuesday interview.
""It's not that people don't win lotteries, and certainly the apes — as they call themselves — that are behind this have their day. And so, let's have them have their day.""
""Apes"" isReddit slangfor retail investors who are bullish on heavily-shorted stocks.
Meme stocks have soared in recent days as retail traders attempt torevive the Reddit-fuelled trade, despite the market bracing for an ever-more aggressive Federal Reserve.
Shares in video-game retailer GameStop are 46% higher, and movie-theater chain AMC's stock is up by a whopping 61% in the last seven days. But Gross noted their high volatility makes them inherently risky.
""The real valuation here is a question of volatility, and the volatility on AMC and GameStop is 120 or so,"" he said, referring to percentagevolatility.
Volatility for an average stock, which reflects the amount a share price has differed over a period,tends to be 15%.
Trading in both stocks was halted briefly on Tuesday morning, after they saw violent swings in price and high volume.
The original ""Bond King"" holds bearish bets against both stocks and has been using options to short them — that is, betting their price will fall.
""If you can sell options that are out of the money levels, then ultimately these lottery ticket companies — which have very little behind them, in my opinion — will go down,"" he said.
A person who sells a call option is selling the right to a buyer to purchase an underlying security at a set price before a certain date.
After the astonishing Reddit-fuelled GameStop short squeeze in early 2021, the buzz behind meme stocksfadedat the start of this year during a rout in the broader market. Some market observers said retail traders were rotating into cryptocurrencies.
Gross recently told the Financial Times he'dlost sleep and moneybetting against AMC and GameStop. But after sticking to his short strategy, he found himself up by as much as $20 million.
He now admits his bearish bets aren't faring well yet again, given that the meme stock mania has returned.
Gross isn't surprised by the influence that millennial retail traders have on the market.
""It's hard to go against momentum, and it's hard to go against the crowd, because it's a crowd that determines direction and upward momentum, if we're in a bull market,"" he said.
""Will they ever become more negative and bearish? It'll take some time. They simply think that stocks go up, that double digits are what they deserve. And we shall see.""

By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) -
The U.S. dollar eased against the euro on Monday, extending last week's fall, as the U.S. currency remains under pressure from the Federal Reserve last week signalling the possibility of interest rate cuts next year.
The dollar was higher against the yen as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) kicked off a two-day meeting that could be crucial in determining the timing of the end of the central bank’s ultra-loose stance on interest rates.
Bets that the Fed will lower its benchmark overnight interest rate at its March meeting by a quarter of a percentage point soared last week after the U.S. central bank left its policy rate unchanged in the 5.25%-5.50% range and officials forecast three-quarters of a percentage point in cuts next year.
Meanwhile,
European Central Bank policymakers
do not expect to change their message on the need for high interest rates before their March meeting, making any rate cut before June difficult, seven people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
""The Fed, having failed to push back on the aggressive dovish repricing we've seen over the last six weeks or so, has given license for financial conditions to loosen further,"" said Michael Brown, market analyst at Trader X in London.
The Federal Reserve is not pre-committing to cutting interest rates soon and swiftly, and the jump in market expectations that it will do so is at odds with how the U.S. central bank functions,
Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee
said on Monday.
Goolsbee was the latest in a slew of Fed speakers who have pushed back against financial market expectations of how abruptly the central bank will pivot to rate cuts, including Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, the New York Fed's John Williams and Atlanta Fed's Raphael Bostic.
""The amount of push back we've started to see post-Powell's press conference is clearly a risk to that downside USD view, though that push back on the idea of cuts as soon as March seems largely to be falling on deaf ears thus far,"" Brown said.
The dollar index, which measures the currency's strength against a basket of six rivals, was

The yen retreated on Monday, but held near its recent highs, as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) kicked off a two-day meeting that could be crucial in determining the timing of the end of the central bank’s ultra-loose stance on interest rates. The dollar was last up 0.56% against the Japanese currency at 143 yen.
The Japanese currency has had a volatile few weeks, as markets struggle to get a grip on how soon the BOJ could phase out its negative interest rate policy, with comments from Governor Kazuo Ueda this month initially sparking a huge rally in the yen.
That was later reversed on news that a policy shift was unlikely to come as early as December, and investors now await Tuesday's BOJ decision for further clarity on the bank's rate outlook.
In any case, since hitting a multi-decade low against the dollar near 152 in November, the yen has gained around 6% in value as traders have grown increasingly convinced the BOJ's low-rates drag on the currency will not last much longer.
""This shift in sentiment will no doubt be welcomed by the Bank of Japan and to some extent helps them out with respect to the weakness of the yen ahead of tomorrow’s rate decision,"" CMC markets strategist Michael Hewson said.
""There is now less incentive for them to think about altering their current policy settings, although they might hint at starting to execute some form of shift early next year.""
Elsewhere, the Australian and New Zealand dollars, which can often act as barometers for investor risk appetite in the currency market, traded about flat on the day but remained near their respective 5-month highs against the U.S. currency.
The pound was

68110,2022-08-15 21:49:44,Crypto Lender Celsius On Pace to Run Out of Cash by October,"Celsius Network, the crypto lender that filed for bankruptcy in July, appears to be in even worse financial straits than previously signaled.
A new court filing Monday from Kirkland & Ellis, a law firm the crypto lender hired to lead its restructuring efforts, included financial projections that Celsius will run out of cash by October.
The filing, submitted to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in advance of an upcoming hearing, also stated that the crypto lender holds $2.8 billion less in crypto than it owes to depositors.
“My initial thought was, ‘Wow, that's a big hole.’ It’s pretty tough,” Thomas Braziel, founder of 507 Capital, an investment firm that provides financing around bankruptcies and reorganizations, told CoinDesk.
Celsius was caught up in this year's crypto crisis, which led towithdrawal suspensionsand insolvencies of various lenders, exchanges and investment companies. Celsiushalted all user withdrawalsin June, citing “extreme market conditions.”
Last month, Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and acknowledged that it had a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet – liabilities exceeding assets – after itpaid off its debt to decentralized finance protocols. That calculation included the estimated value of the firm’s mining equipment and unspecified “other” assets.

The latest disclosure showed that Celsius holds cash that is enough for less than three months, and it forecasted that the company will run out of money by the end of October.
In the monthly cash flow forecast, the firm disclosed a beginning cash balance of almost $130 million at the start of August.
Given the firm’s operating expenses and other costs including expenditure for restructuring efforts are expected to total $137 million for the next three months, the balance would turn negative in October. By then, the firm projects it would have liquidity of negative $33.9 million.
“They [Celsius] could obtain debtor-in-possession financing or sell assets,” Brandon M. Hammer, counsel at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, a law firm, told CoinDesk. “However, to take such steps they would need court approval, which requires notice and an opportunity for interested parties, like customers and the creditors committee, to object."" (Neither Hammer nor the law firm are involved in the bankruptcy case.)
The document also showed that Celsius’ liabilities in crypto to customers surpasses $6.6 billion while the lender only holds $3.3 billion of digital coins – for a $2.8 billion difference as of July 29.
“The coin deficit seems somewhat greater than the losses described in the first day disclosures,” Hammer said. “It also appears that the company likely had to sell assets at depressed prices to meet customer withdrawals before the 'pause.' Such sales are common in bank run situations and may, depending on the particular facts, be subject to clawback risk.”
The most alarming is the hole in bitcoin holdings. Celsius disclosed it owes $2.5 billion in bitcoin (104,962 BTC) while the firm holds $348 million in bitcoin (14,578 BTC) and $557 million in a type of bitcoin derivative (23,348 wBTC).
“The bitcoin hole is huge, much bigger than I would have suspected,” Braziel said.
The lender also holds $1 billion less in ether (ETH) than what it owes to users, although the 410,000 stETH, an ether derivative token, is still in the firm’s possession. The hole in USDC stablecoin holdings accrues to $700 million.
According to the filing, Celsius has 658 millionCELtokens in its treasury; this is the platform’s utility token. Celsius owes 279 million of the tokens to clients, leaving the firm with a 379 million surplus . At current market prices, the CEL net position would be worth almost $1 billion, more than double than what’s in the document, as the token is in the middle of asocial media-driven short squeeze attempt.
Still, the price rise does not help the company solve its balance sheet problem. Most of the token’s supply is locked up on the platform and liquidity on exchanges is thin. If the firm would try to sell CEL to cover a part of the hole on its balance sheet, prices would likely tank.
“The asset side of the CEL holding is probably worth zero,” Braziel said, adding that the liabilities are still there because CEL token owners will probably try to come after Celsius and claim for $1 per token.",24081.67,-0.03,24005.33,-0.35,24100.81,0.05,24016.86,-0.3,24089.69

The Ethereum Chart:Ethereum made a new all-time high of $2548.53 April 15 and has since consolidated.
On Sunday, Ethereum retraced to a daily support level at $1935.44 and bounced sharply, regaining a higher daily support level at $2,150, which aligns with the 21-day exponential moving average (EMA).
Although Ethereum is trading below the eight-day EMA, the eight-day EMA is still trending above the 21-day EMA, making for an overall bullish picture.
Bulls want to see Ethereum continue to hold the $2,500 support level and the 21-day EMA. They also want see it consolidate healthily near all-time highs while it collects enough volume to push it back towards all-time highs.
Bears want to see sustained bear volume to push Ethereum back down below its $2,500 support level. If Ethereum can’t hold that support level, it could retest the $1,935 mark and eventually force the eight-day EMA to cross below the 21-day EMA. If that happens, it could push Ethereum down further towards the $1,824 area.
The Snowflake Chart:Snowflake has retraced 45% from its all-time high of $429 made on Dec. 8, 2020. The stock has fallen into a bullish falling wedge pattern, however, and on April 13 made a bullish break up from it.
Snowflake’s stock is trading on both the eight-day and 21-day EMAs and bullish volume, with even a slight move up in share price, would cause the eight-day EMA to cross above the 21-day EMA, which would be bullish. Declining bear volume on the daily chart shows the stock is running out of sellers, which is also a bullish sign.

Bulls want to see bull volume come into Snowflake’s stock and for it to push off the $232.74 support it is trading at to make a move towards its next resistance level at $255.25. If the stock can reclaim that level, it could move towards the $270 mark.
Bears want to see Snowflake’s stock lose support at the $232 area, which could see it fall down to the stock’s next level of support around $213.
The Biomark Chart:After reaching an all-time high of 42 cents on March 17, Biomark’s stock settled into two bullish patters — a daily bull flag and a daily symmetrical triangle — before breaking bullish on Friday and making a new all-time high on large bull volume.
Biomark’s stock is trading above both the eight- and 21-day EMA, which is a bullish sign, and, although somewhat extended from them, the two commonly followed EMAs made an abrupt upward turn on Friday to try and catch up.
Bulls want to see sustained bullish volume in Biomark’s stock for it to continue its run in all-time highs as there is no price history resistance. Bulls could wait for a retest of the previous all-time high of 42 cents to see if the stock holds above.
Bears want to see bull volume drop off and for Biomark’s stock to lose support at the 42-cent level, which could see the stock drop back down to 35 cents. If Biomark can’t hold support there, it has room to drop further towards the 32-cent area.

The world's largest custodial bank by assets, not to mention the oldest lender in the U.S., announced last week it has added bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) to its custodial offerings.
“What we've heard from our clients is they want institutional grade solutions in the space,” Vince said on the call, noting 75% of them are either investing or actively considering investing in digital assets, and a full 90% expect to be putting money into tokenized assets within the next few years.
Vince said BNY Mellon considers crypto to be a very long-term play, and he expects full-scale adoption to be years or even decades away. He added that the bank isn't putting a ""ton"" of capital towards crypto just yet.

According to theUS Department of State,an estimated 9 million Americans live outside the US, many of whom are retirees. Statistics reveal that between 2019 and 2022, the number of Americans receiving their Social Security benefits from overseas has drastically risen, from 413,000 to 760,000. This isn't a surprise, considering the US has become a costly place to retire to. Sure enough, the BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) Read on Retirement survey reveals that only half of US workers today feel they are on track to retire with a lifestyle they desire, a double-digit drop from last year.
According to the survey, there are four factors seemingly dropping retirement confidence in workers throughout the US; namely market volatility, inflation, recession fears, and a lack of retirement income. At least 93% of workplace savers are worried that market volatility will impact their savings negatively, 86% are worried that inflation will erode what they've managed to save up, and 29% have recessionary fears forcing them to delay retirement. Moreover, 79% of savers are not that confident that they will have enough money to last them throughout retirement. To make things worse, 57 million Americans lack access to a workplace retirement plan at all, which means they are on their own when it comes to saving for retirement, something they may not be doing proactively.
To help potential retirees save better for retirement, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) has recently launched a new product that will help workers access retirement savings through a regular income stream that mimics their paycheck. The product, called LifePath paycheck, works by letting employees make allocations to their lifetime income at the age of 55. After the age of 59 and ½, until they turn 72, they may regularly draw from that sum while the rest of their retirement savings will continue to grow.
BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) is an American multinational investment company. The world’s largest asset manager has demonstrated robust performance and strategic initiatives in the past and continues to do so. Its record Assets Under Management (AUM) nearing $10.5 trillion is evidence of its client success, innovation, and unwavering momentum. In Q1 2024, the company's revenue surged to $4.7 billion, demonstrating an 11% increase year-over-year, while operating income rose by 17% to $1.8 billion. BlackRock, Inc. also saw its profits boost as rising global equity markets pumped its investment advisory and administration fees. Earnings per share (EPS) also saw significant growth, reaching $9.81, a 24% rise from the previous year. Despite seasonal outflows from institutional money market funds and lower effective fee rates in certain segments, the company remains at the forefront of innovation. This includes ventures into Bitcoin funds and expanding into private markets with the planned acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), reinforcing its adaptability and strategic foresight in a dynamic financial landscape. The company is expected to report its second quarter 2024 results on July 15.

Since individuals are barely able to save up for retirement, a lot of them are pondering a move outside of the US. One such country they are considering a move to is Belize. Belize is a retiree favourite owing to its abundant sun-drenched beaches, countless recreational activities, and laid-back vibe. For Americans who wish to retire in Belize, theQualified Retirement Program (QRP)exists to help them move and retire to the country. In order to be eligible for the QRP program, an individual must be a citizen or resident from a commonwealth country but not be Belizean, must be over 45 years of age, and also be a beneficial recipient of monthly retirement income of at least $2,000. Once all requirements are met, individuals will receive a QRP resident card to stay in the country, granting multiple entries as long as they are part of the QRP program. For those wondering about healthcare, health services in the country are also satisfactory. Public health services are largely provided by the Ministry of Health, and are available to every resident of the country. However, there may be problems receiving care through the public health sector which is why it's advisable for expats to buy private health insurance.

Markets have been difficult to watch over the last few weeks across most liquid asset classes, but none so painful afas cryptocurrencies.
The price of bitcoin (BTC) has plummeted in the past week, dropping below $27,000, less than half of its November 2021 high. That’s a long way down in a short amount of time. Most of the major alterfnative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) have posted similar performances.
Amid this volatility, the chorus of voices critical of cryptocurrency has become amplified. Most are rehashing arguments that view cryptos as akin to pyramid or Ponzi-like schemes that funnel most value towards a few founders and early investors.
As of this writing, the crescendo has culminated in a sense that crypto might be “dead.”
That’s the case made by The Spectator’s Ross Clark, who argues that despite the lower prices for bitcoin and other tokens, there are few signs that investors are buying the dip en masse. Clark argues that this is the end stage of a pyramid scheme, when there are not enough new investors to create the next layer of the pyramid and the scheme collapses in on itself.
Writers like Clark are pointing out that bitcoin is not really serving as a hedge to inflation or equities, as some expected, and are calling into question cryptocurrencies’ value as investments themselves.
Oh yeah, it doesn’t help that over last weekend, the Justice Departmentindictedthe CEO of Mining Capital Coin, a crypto mining and investment platform, for allegedly running a $62 million pyramid scheme.
We talk a lot about the virtues and potential of cryptocurrencies in the crypto press, but clients are going to hear and read about these things, and they’re going to look to advisors to help them stay on track. If advisors believe in cryptocurrency, then they have to be prepared to make the case to clients for staying invested in them for the long term.

Ultimately, volatility is a feature, not a bug of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, the crypto with the longest track record and the most investor participation, has seen this type of precipitous drop several times over its history.
Cryptocurrencies may closely correlate with technology sector stocks at times, but the asset classes have historically converged and decoupled, said David Gamble, portfolio manager at Sarson Funds, a crypto education and investment platform for financial advisors.
Gamble believes that crypto will ultimately decouple from equities as a new wave of adoption emerges, driven by state actors. Two countries, El Salvador and the Central African Republic, have already adopted bitcoin as legal tender, and Gamble expects more to follow.
“That being said, good things take time, and we’ll need to see more of this adoption curve,” he said. “Fundamentally, we are seeing the right things happen.”
Another bright spot is regulation, where there appears to be some movement towards clarity and consensus building in the U.S. towards how crypto will be treated – the president’sexecutive orderkicked off coordinated review of cryptocurrencies and the digital asset ecosystem by federal agencies.
For the time being, regulators appear to be taking a more benign approach in the U.S.
“People were very cautious around what might be to come, especially around the debate of people being able to self-custody,” said Stan Miroshnik, partner and co-founder of 10T holdings, a growth-stage private equity firm focused on the digital assets space. “The recent executive order wasn’t just benign, it was forward-thinking by pushing for a thoughtful framework for regulation.”

Progress is being made towards more efficient cryptocurrency products, like a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), to be made available in more marketplaces.
Ultimately, those products will be key in bringing in new crypto investors, said Andrew Puschel, global head of strategy at HashDex, which has created a suite of exchange-traded crypto products, including spot-price ETFs domiciled in Brazil.
“I wouldn’t say the SEC is ready, but they are getting there incrementally,” said Puschel. “There’s been a lot of demand serviced through private placement products, direct ownership and other things, but ultimately from a compliance standpoint advisors and investors want to own an entire portfolio on one platform – all of the assets should be in the same place, and that’s one thing that ETFs can offer.”
And overall, investment in crypto and digital assets is still increasing as businesses develop and offer more ways of accessing the space.
Coinbase (COIN), which recently announced it has reached 89 million verified users, now predicts that there will be 1 billion active cryptocurrency users by 2032. As of 2021, there were estimated to be 295 million users – so there’s still plenty of growth to look forward to within the networks that power crypto.
“It’s clear that crypto has arrived and we can’t afford to ignore crypto any longer,” said Ben Cruikshank, founder of Flourish, a crypto platform for advisors. “Twenty-five percent of American investors are investing in crypto now – that’s the same number that are investing in CDs. It can’t be avoided.”

23982,2019-08-14 11:00:00,Lucien Chen’s VOL: the BTC of hard disk mining,"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / August 14, 2019 /In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto proposed the idea of Bitcoin and published the open-source software of Bitcoin in 2009. Bitcoin’sjourney from 0 to 1is full of twists and turns, ups and downs, and in a blink of eye, it has been 10 years. However, for the majority, Bitcoin appears to be an exclusive club whose dooris only open to a few.
In 2019, former CTO ofTron, Lucien Chen startedaproject called Volume in the hope of guiding more people into the world of digital currency. Theproject generates a new digital currency VOLviatheencrypted consensus algorithmbyhard disk capacity. VOL isacurrency like Bitcoin, but it is not a common public chain project, nor an application project.To some extent, VOL can be seen as the BTC of thehard diskmining industry.
When compared to all hit hard disk mining project, VOL had a better point than the recent hit projects Lambda and BHD, sitting at the top of the chart with the best overall performance.
What improvements has VOL made based on BTC?
VOL, the Volume Network, usesanencrypted algorithm related tohard disk capacityto guarantee the production of the currency. Similar to Bitcoin that usesanencrypted algorithmrelated to computing capacity, the circulation of the currency is fair and square; the difference is that instead of calculating therandom numberfrom the entire network like BTC does, VOL searches for that number inhard disks of the network. Compared with BTC, VOL stands out with its own edges:
1. Eco-friendlier mining: as we all know, BTC mining has been categorized as outdated production capacity due to its huge electricity consumption.By comparison,the POSThard diskmining mechanism of VOL does not consume massive amount of electricity, which not only avoids energy waste but also makes it convenient for users to mine at home. In addition, the life span ofhard diskexceeds that of ASIC chip and GPU used by BTC, which means that you don’t have to frequently update your devices.
2. Naturally anti-centralized:as BTC mining evolves from CPU to GPU to FPGA, the devicesbecomemore professional and thecomputingpower becomes more centralized; yet thehard diskmining of VOL is naturally anti-centralized.
3. Lower threshold:the VOL network is just atastarting point with its hard disk mining mechanism, which allows for mining with simply a household computer; while with BTC, you will be looking at thousands or even millions worth of investment! With VOL, it costs far less than BTC to mine, be it the earlier or the later stage of your investment.
4. Lower risks：the general blockchain market remains unstable. If another bearish market hits, many mines will crash and the mining machines of BTC will just turn into worthless pieces of metal. With the hard disk mining mechanism, even if the hard disk is not used for mining, it can still be used for household computers.
5. More robust economic model: to incentivize early adopters, Satoshi designed the halving mechanism of Bitcoin: the block reward halves every 210,000 blocks. In 2020, the reward will be halved down to 6.25 BTC. When you look at VOL, with a dynamic token producing mechanism, VOL’s economic model prevents problems like high threshold for the latecomers and centralized mining capacity, making it possible forenhanceddecentralization and userparticipation.
6. Healthier and more secure management of VOL mining pool: for BTC, the mining pool whichdistribute all the profitsto each miner in a centralized way,which is very likely to be anon-transparent and unfairprocess. With VOL, miners sign tojointheMiningPoolRepresentative Nodes (MPRN), and the mining pool does notholdthe private key of the miners.Pledgesare made on the chain toMPRNs, and the profits will be automatically distributed, guaranteeing the benefits of the miners in a highly secureway.
Lucien believes that VOL is still at its infancy, and the team is patiently welcoming more participants toitsecosystem. The team is confident that one day when a “consensus” is reached of VOL, it will become a basic currency justlikeBTC. Even BTC was unknown 10 years ago. Lucien and the team is very confident about the future of VOL.Lucien Chen’s vision for VOL: a “basic currency” like BTC
Statistics showthat by the end of Q1, 2019, mining digital currencies account for 68% of the general digital currency market. The mainstream projects are those based on the PoW consensus mechanism, and these projects are all faced with problems such as high energy consumption, centralized computing power and scaling challenges, making it harder and harder to see the future of BTC and other PoW-based tokens; other projects like ETH and GRIN are shied away from being mainstream options due to their high GPU costs. On that note, a project that is based on hard disk mining is one that truly has low threshold.
Lucien Chenhas his vision set for VOL: a “basic currency” like BTC, and the team is setting sail for an ambitiousjourney of integrity and intelligence.

79571,2022-07-19 19:54:47,Bitcoin Jumps to Highest Since the Aftermath of Celsius Meltdown,"(Bloomberg) -- A rally in cryptocurrencies Tuesday took Bitcoin out of a one-month-old trading range and ignited big jumps in smaller tokens commonly referred to as altcoins.

The largest virtual coin climbed as much as 10% to $23,684, a level it was last at in mid-June, or just after the collapse of crypto lender Celsius Network. Ether at one point added almost 11%. Solana also achieved a double-digit percentage gain.
Bitcoin has struggled to escape a $19,000 to $22,000 range as investors lick their wounds from a rout sparked by tightening monetary policy and exacerbated by the toppling of Celsius and the TerraUSD stablecoin in May. It has retreated from a record high of almost $69,000 in November.
“I think the worst happened,” Galaxy Digital Chief Executive Mike Novogratz said at the Bloomberg Crypto Summit. Novogratz reiterated that he still maintains a five-year forecast of $500,000.
A sustained break above $22,000 could renew the speculative momentum that can grip crypto assets in the blink of an eye. Expectations for Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes are less aggressive now, which may help.
US stocks rallied as investors assessed the outlook for earnings amid speculation disappointments may be already priced into markets. Bitcoin has been highly correlated to movements in equities.
Ether is extending a rally that began last week after developers of the Ethereum blockchain gave a target for the long-anticipated software update that is projected to lower the network’s energy usage.
Altcoins often outperform Bitcoin during rallies and underperform when prices are falling, in part because they’re a favorite of more speculative traders and tend to be less liquid.
Some enthusiasts are forecasting that Bitcoin will recoup this year’s losses once the Fed’s tightening cycle is done.
“We’ll have a powerful up move after that. So we’re in that zone -- this is the accumulation zone.” Eric Peters, founder and chief executive officer of One River Asset Management said at the Bloomberg Crypto Summit. “You’re in that period of time where you’re not supposed to be selling, you’re supposed to be buying.”
The recent rebound in Bitcoin has pared its loss this year to about 50%. The overall market value of digital tokens has retaken the $1 trillion level.

The tweet came in the background ofMcDonald’s fun jab at members of the crypto community. Several reactions followed from famous personalities in crypto, such as Michael Saylor ofMicrostrategyand Charles Hoskinson ofCardano. Amidst the memes and jokes, Musk called on McDonald’s to accept Dogecoin.
This comes weeks after Teslaannouncedthat it was now accepting Dogecoin for its merchandise. The EV giant now allows people to buy some of its products using the popular meme coin.
Tesla’s Dogecoin support page contains further information about the company’s policy on the token. This includes the fact that it won’t refund any overpayment and can’t accept payments from multiple wallets for a single product.
Notably, the electric car maker briefly acceptedBitcoinpayment for its vehicles before canceling due to environmental concerns.
It wasn’t only Musk that asked McDonald’s to accept the cryptocurrency. Billy Marcus, the Dogecoin co-founder, also stated his support. He tweeted that he’d eat a happy meal while watching Elon Musk eat a happy meal on TV.
In its response, McDonald’s has stated that it’ll only accept DOGE when Tesla starts accepting “Grimacecoin.”
When the burger chain tweeted about Grimacecoin, there was no digital asset named that. However, someone quickly developed the coin onBinanceSmart Chain, with its value rising by over 260,000% within a few hours.
This prompted Dogecoin founder topoint outthat the crypto space has more serious issues with shills and crap tokens than making jokes about one.
While both sides continue to bant, Dogecoin has seen an 8% rise in the past 24 hours. The token, which has fallen significantly in the last few weeks, is now trading at around $0.145. This follows the general uptick in the market, with almost every major cryptocurrency seeing a rise in value.

17187,2018-02-05 18:20:00,"Bitcoin dives below $7,000 for the first time since November 15","MI
• The price of bitcoin, the largest digital currency by market capitalization, dipped below $7,000 for the first time since November 15.
• The cryptocurrency is down nearly 64% since hitting an all-time high above $19,000 in December.
Thebitcoinbear market has extended into new territory.
The cryptocurrency, which gripped the attention of the markets when it soared to almost $20,000 a coin, was trading below $7,000 on Monday for the first time since November 15, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
Bitcoin has had a rough start to 2018,hit by fears of a regulatory crackdown and slipping Asian volumes.
At last check, the digital currency was trading down 14.7% against the dollar at $6,986 a coin, according to data from Markets Insider. That's nearly a 64% decline from its all-time high set in late December.
Across the cryptocurrency market, digital currencies were trading in the red. The total market capitalization of the crypto market declined by more than $70 billion over the last 24-hours.
The bloodbath appears to be connected to a slew of announcements by numerous major banks that they will ban the use of their credit cards to buy bitcoin and other digital currencies. In the US, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup have announced bans, whileLloyds Bank is expected to do the same in the UK.
Aaron Lasher, the chief marketing officer of Breadwallet, a cryptocurrency wallet company which said it would allow customers to use credit cards to buy crypto on its platform on Monday, said such bans would be bad for crypto.
""In the short-term it would be very bad for the industry,"" Lasher said. ""It'll make it very difficult for new comers to get into digital currencies.""
On top of the announced bans, confidence has also been dented by reports China is planning a ban on websites related to intial coin offerings and other forms ofcryptocurrency trading.
""To prevent financial risks, China will step up measures to remove any onshore or offshore platforms related to virtual currency trading or ICOs,"" an article in Financial News said,according to a report in the South China Morning Post.
More concerns emerged about the sector last week asFacebook banned cryptocurrency advertisementsand US regulators began investigating Tether,a cryptocurrency that some fear has been used to inflate the value of bitcoin.

Bitcoin (BTC)has been increasing since bouncing from support on March 25. While the increase has been significant, BTC has stalled near the $60,000 level. It’s been struggling to move above it since March 30.
However, technical indicators are bullish. TheMACDhas given a bullish reversal signal, theRSIhas crossed above 50, and theStochastic oscillatorhas made a bullish cross.
Therefore, BTC is expected to eventually break out from this minor resistance level.

35789,2018-06-14 00:42:00,3 Top Growth Stocks to Buy in June,"With the summer season officially in full swing and temperatures continuing to rise, we're intent on ensuring that the value of your portfolio follows suit.
To that end, we asked three Motley Fool contributors for their favorite growth stocks to buy this month. Read on to learn why they likeUniversal Display(NASDAQ: OLED),Littelfuse(NASDAQ: LFUS), andSquare(NYSE: SQ).
IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.
Steve Symington(Universal Display):Universal Display stockgot hammered early this yearafter the company's CFO, Sidney Rosenblatt, told investors that OLED display manufacturing growth would slow in 2018. More specifically, he stated that capacity growth would ""take a bit of a breather this year as panel makers build the framework for the next wave of high-volume OLED production,which is expected to ramp next year."" (Emphasis mine.)
To be sure, Universal Display began to rebound in earnest last month after the company postedstrong quarterly results. Management also elaborated that OLED panel demand is expected to rebound in the second half of 2018, followed by an estimated 50% increase in manufacturers' installed capacity base in 2019, leading to another year of ""meaningful growth.""
If that weren't enough, two weeks ago the stock popped again following reports thatApplehaddecided to adopt OLED displaysacross its entire iPhone line in 2019, expanding its use of OLED from just the Apple Watch and the high-end iPhone X. To be fair, some industry watchers have doubted whether that's probable given current supply constraints. But it seems to fall in line with Universal Display's prediction for enormous capacity base growth next year.
With OLED stock trading at less than half its 52-week high, I think astute investors would do well to open or add to their positions before that growth becomes more evident.
Neha Chamaria(Littelfuse):Littelfuse is one of those companies that would draw nothing more than a yawn if I tell you what it does: It manufactures circuit protection products. You know, those fuses and sensors that protect equipment from electrical hazards? That's how boring Littelfuse's business is. Yet the company's extraordinary operational performance and the mind-boggling run-up in its stock price in the past decade will stun you.
LFUS Net Income (TTM)data byYCharts.
Littelfuse has a lot going for it. It is the world's leading circuit protection company today with presence in more than 15 countries and has a well-diversified portfolio, with electronics, automotive, and industrial contributing 64%, 29%, and 7%, respectively, to its top line.
After hitting $1 billion in sales in 2016, Littelfuse continues to grow at a torrid pace, closing2017 with record sales, earnings, and cash flows. In its latest quarter, the company'ssales climbed 46.4%, thanks largely to the acquisition of semiconductor manufacturer IXYS earlier this year.
In the long run, management is aiming for:
• Double-digit growth in sales, with near-equal contribution from organic sales and acquisitions.
• Operating margins of 17%-19%.
• Double-digit growth in earnings per share.
• FCF free cash flows (FCF) growth in line with earnings.
Moreover, management also plans to return 40% of FCF to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in the long term compared with only 26% that it deployed in the past five years.
Now those growth projections are too good to be taken lightly. With emerging megatrends like the Internet of Things, electric and autonomous vehicles, and alternative energy also opening up new markets for Littelfuse, this is one growth stock you need to watch closely.
Travis Hoium(Square):When starting a small business like a food truck, salon, or e-commerce business, there are a lot of services an entrepreneur needs to pull together, like point-of-sale, payroll, and scheduling. Square has become a go-to service for small businesses and has been able to increase both the number of services offered to customers as well as the size of businesses it serves, which is why it's my top growth stock this month.
You can see in the chart below that Square has more than doubled revenue since coming public in 2015, proving it's capable of rapid growth, although it's also reported a net loss every year.
SQ Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts.
What management has done is pour all of its potential profits into growing the services it provides customers, which has held down profitability. There's now employee management, invoices, payroll, and even capitalavailable to small businesses using Square. Once these capabilities are built out they can be leveraged by the sales team to grow the number of businesses Square has and the number of services used by each customer.They also lock customers into the Square ecosystem once they're up and running.
What I like about Square's business today is that it's not only attracting small businesses, it's increasing the size of businesses it's working with and that's helping drive payment volume growth. In the first quarter of 2018, sellers with over $500,000 of annual gross payment volume accounted for 20% of sales compared to only 13% two years ago. Over the same time frame, gross payment volume increased from $10.3 billion to $17.8 billion.
Financially, Square continues to grow and leverage its platform of services to improve its bottom line as well. On top of the revenue growth I showed above, Square reported $44.9 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2016 and a net loss of $0.50 per share in 2016. In 2018, it's expecting adjustedEBITDAto be $240 million to $250 million and net loss to be $0.04 to breakeven. The growing top line and rapidly improving bottom line make this a great growth stock to buy in June.
We can't guarantee that these three companies will go on to beat the market going forward. But given Universal Display's impending rebound, Littelfuse's diversified product portfolio and enviable growth, and Square's appeal to small and large businesses alike, we believe the chances are high that they'll do exactly that. Investors would be wise to invest accordingly.

75899,2022-03-28 18:27:40,Shiba Inu Transaction Volume Soars 288% As Price Rallies by 21%,"• The broader market recovery also triggered Shiba Inu’s staggering 21.19% rally.
• Bullishness coming from investors resulted in the transaction volume rising by almost four times.
• The rally also led to SHIB’s listing on the Canadian exchange Netcoins.
Today proved to be a rather unexpected event for bothBitcoinand the altcoins as a rally triggered the entirecryptomarket to rise by over 5% ($120 billion). However,Shiba Inumanaged to stand out today after making spectacular gains over the last 24 hours.
In the last two weeks, Shiba Inu noted a stable rise, but today, the altcoin exploded and rose by 21.19%. In doing so, the coin marked alocal topof $0.00002854.
But the bullishness over the last 15 days combined with the cues from the broader market is the actual reason behind this rise.
On the MACD indicator, SHIB has observed rising bullishness since March 18, after successfully marking a bullish crossover on the day before. The MACD line (white) only rose further today, leaving behind the signal line (red).
But the rally did so much more for the coin by turning the active downtrend into an uptrend today as the white dots of the Parabolic SAR shifted underneath the candlesticks.
Thus, the allure of the Shiba Inu led to a significant rise in the activity from investors as well, and the meme coin noted a stark increase in the trading volume.
While SHIB clocked in about $792 million today yesterday, the same figure rose to $3.08 billion. This marks a 288% rise in 24 hours as of press time, which was certainly beyond expectations.
Most of this came from the buy orders in the market, which exceeded the volume of SHIB sold at different intervals throughout the day.
In aggregate, about 761 billion SHIB worth approximately $21.8 million has been bought out during the trading hours at the time of writing.
While Shiba Inu’s loyal community is enough for the meme coin, today’s performance certainly put it on the hotlist of multiple crypto exchange facilitators.
One of them was a Canadian cryptocurrency exchange, Netcoins, whichlistedShiba Inu in its library of assets. Along with SHIB,Dogecoin,Decentraland,Polygon, andFantomwere also listed.
But Shiba Inu will also need to bring in some ecosystem development every now and then since, at the moment, no new development has been observed on the network.

27787,2018-04-20 11:09:00,These Are America's Favorite Quick-Serve Restaurants,"For a long time, the primary appeal of manyquick-serve restaurantschains lay in their ability to pump out moderately tasty meals extremely rapidly. Speed, however, seems to be less of a top concern as the leaders in this space have raised their quality standards -- and with them, consumers' expectations.
Nearly 11,500 people weighed in on their favorite chains for Market Force Information's annual survey on QSRs. The report ranked consumers' favorites across five categories: burgers, chicken, Mexican, sandwiches, and pizza.
""In this year's study, we saw that scores on the Composite Loyalty Index for QSR brands across all categories declined from last year,"" said Market Force Chief Customer Officer Brad Christian in a press release. ""We attribute this to two factors: consumer expectations of the QSR experience are rising, and, in many cases, execution at these restaurants is declining.
None of the category winners is the biggest player in its segment. While four of the five are nationally well known, they are also brands that you could argue have a bit of a cult-like following.
That's certainly true of In-N-Out, which won for burger chain, and Chick-fil-A, which took the top spot in chicken. Mexican winnerChipotle(NYSE: CMG)certainly once had that sort of cachet, and its top placement is a strong sign that its comeback has taken hold. Sandwich winner Wawa is a regional player, but has a strong reputation as a convenience store that offers quality, handmade food. However, it's Pizza Ranch that may be the biggest surprise on the list, given that it has a mere 200 locations across 13 states.
""As our research continues to show, delighting guests by providing an exceptional customer experience is a key differentiator in an incredibly competitive environment,"" Christian said.
Higher-end burgers have become a QSR staple. Image source: Getty Images.
In-N-Out took the top spot for the second year in a row. It was followed by Culver's in second and Five Guys in third. In-N-Out also received the highest scores across all QSR food categories studied, making it America's favorite QSR across the board.
Bigger brands did not do as well.Restaurant Brands International's Burger King,Jack in the BoxandMcDonald'sranked lowest among the 13 burger chains in the survey.
Wawa's win is a bit historic: It's the first time a convenience store has taken the top spot in the category. That may be bad news for traditional sandwich shops, as the chain has been expanding quickly, and its customers can fill up their gas tanks (usually at very competitive fuel prices) while waiting for their food to be made to order.
Also worth noting is that Wawa jumped five spots from last year. To win, it displaced 2017 victor Firehouse Subs, which slipped to second place this year. Jersey Mike's came third, followed by Jimmy John's, Jason's Deli and McAlister's Deli.
Again, the biggest names did not perform as well. Arby's came in last in nearly all of the measured categories.
While Chipotle has struggled to win back customers since itsE. coli outbreakmore than two years ago, it took first place in the Market Force study both in 2017 and 2018. This year, it narrowly beat out second-place finisherEl Pollo Loco,which overtook Moe's Southwest Grill, last year's runner-up. Qdoba came in fourth. And, as you might imagine based on the other categories' results,Yum! Brands' Taco Bell ranked at the bottom.
Clearly, respondents to this survey showed their love for smaller players, a pattern that's most evident in the pizza category. Pizza Ranch, which has fewer restaurants total thanDomino's(NYSE: DPZ)has in South Korea alone, took the top rank. It was followed byPapa Murphy'sin second, and last year's winner Marco's Pizza in third. Those lesser-known chains were followed by Domino's in fourth andPapa John'sin fifth.
Not only did Chick-fil-A win its category for the fourth straight year, it received the highest score across every category of the study except for ""healthy options."" Raising Cane's came in second, followed by Zaxby's and El Pollo Loco, which tied for third. Boston Market took the next spot followed, by RBI's Popeyes. Yum's KFC came in last of the 10 chains considered.
To rank on the study, a chain had to receive at least 2% of the total votes. That system allowed smaller brands to rank even though they likely were not mentioned by many of the respondents.
What's clear from this report is that the quick-serve market has room for disruption. Small chains like Pizza Ranch or In-n-Out can build a loyal audience -- but whether either can scale nationally and retain what makes customers love them remains to be seen.
Consumers clearly spend a lot of money at the biggest players, despite their poor rankings in this study. That suggests those chains could be vulnerable, but Domino's and McDonald's specifically have shown repeatedly that convenience and value can drive business, even when consumers aren't as in love with the food being served.

The investment bank said the SEC may now focus on bringingstablecoins, including the two largest by market cap, tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), anddecentralized financeprotocols into regulatory compliance.
The SEC said earlier this month thatit was suingcrypto exchange Binance, its founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and the operating company forBinance.USon allegations of violating federal securities laws. A day later itsued rival exchangeCoinbase (COIN) on similar charges.
If the SEC is looking to reduce the potential for unregulated DeFi protocols to serve as viable alternatives to regulated lenders and exchanges, then they could “target the stablecoins that serve as the lifeblood of decentralized finance,” analysts led by Mark Palmer wrote.
By targeting these stablecoins, the SEC may also weaken the DeFi ecosystem, the report said.
Berenberg says that if USDC is targeted by U.S. regulators, the impact on Coinbase’s revenue could be significant, noting that in first-quarter 2023 the exchange generated $199 million in net revenue – about 27% of the total – from interest income earned on USDC reserves.
Bitcoin (BTC), which the SEC has affirmed as a commodity rather than an unregistered security, is likely to be the ultimate beneficiary of the crackdown, the note said.
MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares are well positioned to outperform, given the company’s focus on acquiring and holding bitcoins, as the regulatory clampdown will likely give rise to a U.S. crypto industry that is more bitcoin-focused than it has been in recent years, the report added.

70156,2021-12-06 23:00:00,Buffett stays buoyant as Bitcoin plunges 20% — here are the top 3 stocks he's holding instead,"As a value investor, Warren Buffett loves to buy quality assets on the cheap. But there’s one beaten-down asset he won’t be picking up anytime soon: Bitcoin.
The price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency dropped more than 20% over the past month to around $48,850. That could be an opportunity for curious investors standing on the sidelines.
Plenty of investing icons, such as Cathie Wood and Kevin O’Leary, have been proponents of Bitcoin. But Buffett, arguably the most famous investor of our time, is not a fan.
“I don't have any bitcoin. I don't own any cryptocurrency; I never will,” the billionaire told CNBC last year. He earlier explained to Yahoo Finance that when you buy crypto, “you don’t have anything that is producing anything.”
In other words, Buffett likes assets with clear, material use. Take a look at the top three holdings of his company Berkshire Hathaway — and if none of those appeal, plenty ofalternative investmentshave inherent value, too.
Apple is by far Buffett’s largest holding, accounting for more than 40% of Berkshire’s portfolio by market value.
One of the reasons behind that concentration is the sheer increase in the tech giant’s stock price. Over the past five years, Apple shares have surged more than 480%.
Earlier this year, management revealed that the company’s active installed base of hardware has surpassed 1.65 billion devices, including over 1 billion iPhones. But the company does more than just making smartphones and computers; it has built an ecosystem.
While competitors offer cheaper devices, many consumers don’t want to live outside Apple’s network of highly compatible products and services. That means, as inflation spikes, Apple can pass higher costs to its global consumer base without worrying as much about a drop in sales volume.
The business has been growing at a commendable pace. In the September quarter, revenue surged 29% year-over-year to $83.4 billion.
After a multi-year bull run, Apple trades at $165 per share. But you can always get a smaller piece of the company using a popular app that allows you tobuy fractions of shareswith as much money as you are willing to spend.
As the second-largest holding in Berkshire’s portfolio, Bank of America has served Buffett quite well.
The stock is up 49% year to date — not bad for a traditional blue-chip company outside the tech sector.
While Bank of America doesn’t produce goods in the same way Apple does, its important role in our financial system gives the stock inherent value.
Bank of America offers a wide range of banking, asset management and other financial and risk-management products and services to consumers, small and middle-market businesses and large corporations.
And while many businesses fear rising interest rates, banks love them. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that in today’s environment, banks can return a lot of cash to shareholders.
Bank of America bought back $9.9 billion of its common stock in Q3. In June, the company raised its quarterly dividend rate by 17% to 21 cents per share.
At the current share price, the bank offers an annual dividend yield of 1.9%.
American Express shares are up a solid 36% year to date, though in the past month, they’ve pulled back around 10%.
Berkshire owns 151.6 million shares of the company, worth approximately $24.5 billion. That makes the credit-card giant its third-largest holding.
Just like Bank of America, American Express provides an essential service. While Bitcoin’s use as currency is still quite limited, Amex’s payment products and services cater to a broad range of consumers and small and large businesses.
And the business is commonly considered inflation-proof. American Express makes most of its money through discount fees; merchants are charged a percentage of every Amex card transaction. As the price of goods and services increases, the company gets to take a cut of larger bills.
In Q3, the company’s revenue jumped 25% year-over-year to $10.9 billion.
Berkshire also owns shares of competitors Visa and Mastercard, but Buffett is clearly betting on American Express as those other two positions are much smaller.
If you don’t want to pick winner and losers yourself, you can always build a diversified portfolio automatically just by usingyour “spare change.”
Buffett argues that because Bitcoin doesn’t produce anything, investors are “just hoping the next guy pays more” for their inherently worthless asset.
On the other hand, if an asset can offer material, ongoing value, investors won’t be so stressed about their ability to offload it.
And as it turns out, the majority of Berkshire’s holdings are companies that pay regular cash dividends — a great source of passive income. But you don’t have to limit yourself to the stock market.
These days, retail investors have access to avariety of alternative investments, many of which offer impressive cash income. Traditionally, these opportunities have been available only to the ultra rich, like Buffett.
Now, with the help of new platforms, a single investment canbuild a fixed-income portfoliospread across multiple asset classes.

Bitcoin {{BTC}} jumped to $57,000 following the report, only to erase the gain and tumble below $54,000 to the lowest since Aug. 5. It is down nearly 3% over the past 24 hours.

The release left market watchers contemplating the Federal Reserve's pace to lower interest rates, which it's expected to do later this month. Most recently, traders assigned a probability of more than 70% to a 25 basis-point cut and almost 30% for a larger, 50 bps cut at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Sept. 18, according to theCME FedWatch Tool.
Later in the morning, Fed Governor Christopher Wallersaidin a speech at Notre Dame University that the ""time has come"" to lower interest rates and he will advocate for ""front-loading rate cuts if that is appropriate.""
Some observers argued that a smaller cut would be more beneficial for risk assets, as a 50 bps cut might signal that the Fed is increasingly concerned about the U.S. economy falling into a recession.

“Using the Accessibility Service mechanism means that the Trojan is able to bypass security measures used by banks to protect against older generation of mobile Trojans and changes to Google’s security policy introduced in new versions of the Android OS,” said Group-IB.
Group-IB also warned the malware can mimic legitimate push notifications.
So far, 32 cryptocurrency apps have been targets, including Coinbase, BitPay, and Bitcoin Wallet. The malware also targets JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America clients, as well as payment systems and messenger services.

However, the price is currently forming a lower low pattern that could unleash a continuation of the bearish sequence that got strengthened from the highs of November 9th.
In the midst of the rebound, ADA eyes the 50-period simple moving average at the H4 chart, around the $1.95 level, where a dynamic resistance acts as a strong barrier to overcome for the weak buyers at this stage.
In addition, the RSI indicator is also trying to gather pace and could be poised to rally further towards the $2.05 level, where the 200-period simple moving average lies.
If the RSI’s slope consolidates above the 50 level, the bulls could strengthen, and eventually, Cardano’s coin could be on its way to hitting the highs from November 9th at $2.37. Still, after such maneuver, thecryptocurrencywill remain trapped into a rangebound stage unless it pierces above $2.37.
When ADA materializes such a move, eyes will be on the next critical psychological level at $2.50, followed by the $2.65 zone. That scenario could add more fuel to the building of the bullish structure that could unleash more buys for the midterm in the crypto.
From a bearish point of view, if the $1.70 level gives up and the bears strengthen further, the crypto will eye the next tough nut to crack around $1.60. Also, if the bearish scenario persists with lower lows’ formation in the middle of the decline, ADA could likely plummet to test the $1.30 level before the end of the year.
At this stage, it’s also discarded a stagnation phase because the volume is high, and the on-chain metrics say that ADA is currently treading volatile waters. Moreover, there is a death crossover of both 50 and 200-period SMAs.

42926,2022-07-26 02:44:53,"Stocks fall, bonds rise as investors seek safety","By Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street equities fell and U.S. Treasuries rallied on Tuesday a day before a likely Federal Reserve rate hike as investors grappled with growing economic concerns after retail giant Walmart Inc's profit warning and signs of a looming gas supply crisis in Europe.
The bid for safety also boosted the U.S. dollar, which snapped a three-session losing streak, while the energy supply concerns weighed on the euro.
European Union leaders agreed to ration gas usage after Russian's Gazprom said gas flows to Germany would fall from Wednesday to half of the current amount - already at just 40% of normal capacity.
U.S. equities fell with retail stocks after Walmart slashed its profit forecast late on Monday as surging prices for food and fuel spurred consumers to cut back on discretionary purchases. [.N]
Since Walmart is seen as a ""litmus test for the health of the consumer,"" Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, said investors are concerned about growth and feeling uncertain ahead of key economic data due out this week and the Fed's interest rate decision expected on Wednesday.
""This week is forcing investors to be very short-term oriented. It's not allowing anybody to lift their eyes up even a week or a month,"" Schleif said. ""It's an asset market, not just in stocks, that seems to suggest people think growth is questionable in the intermediate term.""
Investors are expecting a 75 basis point Fed rate increase on Wednesday, with markets pricing about a 10% risk of a larger hike, as well as waiting to see whether economic warning signs prompt a shift in rhetoric.
""If they did 100 basis points it would probably surprise the market. There's that nervousness. If it's 75, as expected, and the Fed says it's starting to see hints of slowing, the market might take that as a positive,"" Schleif said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 228.5 points, or 0.71%, to 31,761.54, the S&P 500 lost 45.79 points, or 1.15%, to 3,921.05 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 220.09 points, or 1.87%, to 11,562.58.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.03% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.92%.
Adding to Tuesday's gloom was the International Monetary Fund forecast for global real GDP growth of 3.2% in 2022, down from its 3.6% forecast issued in April, with downside risks from high inflation and Russia's invasion of Ukraine potentially pushing the world economy to the brink of recession.
The gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes widened on Tuesday after more than two weeks when the short-end yield has been higher than the long end - often a recession signal.
Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 5/32 in price to yield 2.8032%, from 2.82% late on Monday. The 30-year bond last rose 17/32 in price to yield 3.0227%, from 3.05%. The 2-year note last fell 2/32 in price to yield 3.0609%, from 3.035%.
""The flight to quality makes sense if you're concerned about a meaningful slowdown in growth or even heightened recession fears in Europe because of volatility in energy supply,"" said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale. ""Then you should see investors flock to Treasuries.""
The dollar index rose 0.752%, with the euro down 1.04% to $1.0114. The Japanese yen weakened 0.15% versus the greenback at 136.90 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.2027, down 0.12% on the day.
After rising earlier in the session, oil prices settled in the red as investors worried about weaker consumer confidence and the expectation that another 20 million barrels of crude oil would be released from the U.S Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
Prices were supported earlier in the session on news that Russia was tightening its gas squeeze on Europe.
U.S. crude settled down 1.78% at $94.98 per barrel and Brent settled at $104.40, down 0.71%.
Spot gold dropped 0.1% to $1,716.98 an ounce as investors eyed economic uncertainties and waited on the Fed.
Bitcoin last fell 1.86% to $20,910.08.

32275,2021-03-26 15:04:48,Staking as an Asset Class? This Swiss Institutional Fund Is Jumping In,"While institutional investors around the world are just getting their heads aroundbitcoin, asset managers in crypto-friendly Switzerland are heading into staking on next-generation blockchain networks.
Announced Friday, Zurich-based investment firm Tavis Digital has partnered with Singapore-based Persistence, a bridge for traditional firms into undiscovered realms such as token staking and decentralized finance (DeFi). Tavis Digital is a spin-off of Tavis Capital, an asset manager regulated by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) with about $1.07 billion in assets under management.
Nimble and financially sophisticated countries like Switzerland and Singapore are ahead of the pack when it comes to cryptocurrency and its applications.

“We white-label our services to institutional clients and stakeholders who do not know how to run a validator node both on the software side as well as on the hardware side,” said Tushar Aggarwal, CEO and co-founder of Persistence. “It’s not a trivial thing to run a validator node, you need almost close to 100% uptime otherwise you get slashed.”
Persistence enables investors to get staking rewards (akin to interest) by participating in proof-of-stake (PoS) networks such as Cosmos, Polygon (formerly Matic), NEAR, SKALE, Terra and others. The tie-up with Tavis is a demonstration that some traditional funds are going beyond merely adding bitcoin as an asset class.
PoS systems eschew the Bitcoin blockchain’s energy-intensive method of ordering transactions so coins cannot be spent twice and propose to solve the “nothing at stake” problem by apportioning some skin in the game. Purchasing and holding tokens on a blockchain earns rewards for validating the order of transactions, but can result in losses (known as “slashing”) if a validating node goes offline or is unresponsive.
Direct participation in staking networks and all the validation node husbandry that goes with it is a complex business, and Persistence provides a complete handholding for firms that don’t want to spend time and money setting up dedicated blockchain teams. This hosting service earns Persistence about 1% on the assets being staked. The firm has some $260 million in assets under delegation, mostly on Cosmos.

“With backdrop of most parts of western Europe now at 0% interest rates, or negative interest rates in certain jurisdictions, there is an increased demand from institutional folks to generate fixed income yields,” said Aggarwal, adding:
“And that’s what Tavis Digital is trying to do – create this fixed income fund vehicle and generate returns from proof-of-stake mining as an asset class.”

5589,2019-12-02 09:00:34,China forms state-backed blockchain alliance,"China is forming a state-backed blockchain alliance featuring a number of major cryptocurrency and financial companies, according to reports. Huobi China is one of the first big names to join the Blockchain Services Network Alliance (BSN). The cryptocurrency firm was unveiled as a member during the recent Blockchain Service Network Partner Conference, which was sponsored by the National Information Centre (NIC), China UnionPay (the countrys equivalent to Visa), and China Mobile. It is believed that the alliance will look to develop and implement a national blockchain service infrastructure which spans across public networks, regions, and institutions, according to local media outlet Xinhua . The network has been planned by top-level employees at the NIC and is being independently developed by China UnionPay and China Mobile. The blockchain service network can effectively reduce the threshold of blockchain application and facilitate the rapid promotion and application of blockchain technology, said Lin Yunan, director of the NIC. Other members of the alliance include China Telecom, China Merchants Banks International, and Weizhong Bank. The news follows a recent trend of positive sentiment towards blockchain technology in China, with President Xi Jinping recently announcing blockchain will be vital for the countrys future. Shortly after, a state-run newspaper ran a cover article on Bitcoin. While the piece was swift to point out the negatives of BTC, it sung the praises of the underlying blockchain technology.

12551,2018-01-11 12:10:58,Why I’m Still Bullish on a Rite Aid Corporation Stock Turnaround,"After its acquisition offer fromWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc(NASDAQ:WBA) got scrapped and turned into an all-cash deal for a handful of stores,Rite Aid Corporation(NYSE:RAD) was left for dead by investors. The fall from grace was not pretty. RAD stock dropped from nearly $9 to below a $1.50 in less than a year.
That fall doesn’t make much sense.
A few months ago, Walgreens agreed to buy 1,932 stores, or about 43% of the total store base, from Rite Aid for $4.4 billion (and those 43% of stores were the under-performing ones).
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
But Rite Aid’s current market cap is less than $2.2 billion. That means that Walgreens paid more than twice as much as Rite Aid’s current market cap for less than half of the company’s revenue-generating assets.
Scratching your head yet? Either Walgreens grossly overpaid for nearly 2,000under-performingRite Aid locations, or the market is missing the boat on RAD stock.
I think it is the latter. Here’s why.
• 10 Dividend Stocks You Can Set and Forget
Rite Aid just reported quarterly numbers. They weren’t great. Comparable sales are still negative. Margins are still under pressure. Adjusted earnings aren’t trending up in any bullish way.
But the numbers also weren’t all bad.
Comparable sales trends are improving. Front End comps have trended this year from -1.1% to -0.8% to -0.3%. Pharmacy comps have trended from -5.5% to -4.9% to -3.5%. Clearly, there is an upward trend here, and if it continues, Rite Aid will be looking at positive comps soon.
It should continue. Long term comps are cyclical. Comps were up in fiscal 2009, down in 2010 and 2011, up in 2012, down in 2013, up for the next three years and down the next two years. They will likely be down this year, and then up next year. This follows a long-term cycle.
Moreover, reimbursement rates stabilized quarter-over-quarter, and that is big for the margin improvement outlook.
If reimbursement rates can start improving and script counts start to trend up (which is not unlikely because Rite Aid’s store portfolio post-Walgreens deal has a higher mix of remodeled stores, which had significantly higher script growth last quarter than non-wellness stores), margins will start to rebound.
All in all, the numbers are actually showing signs of a near-term inflection point in RAD stock. The turnaround isn’t here yet, but it is coming.
The other overarching concern weighing on RAD stock is that the company won’t be around long enough for its turnaround to materialize.
Why?Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).
But as I’ve pointed out before, Amazon withdrew its pharmacy application in Maine, meaning that either Amazon is scrapping/postponing its whole big pharma plans or that the company is looking for alternative ways to enter the market (i.e. acquisition, and Rite Aid tops the acquisition list given its big reach and discounted price tag).
Either way, the Amazon threat to Rite Aid is minimal at this point in time.
Even if Amazon does bust into the big pharma market without acquiring Rite Aid, the risks to Rite Aid are already priced into the stock price. Because the company is already paying down debt from funds received in the Walgreens deal, Rite Aid’s enterprise value is rapidly dropping. But its EBITDA is eroding at a much slower pace, putting the EV/EBITDA multiple at under 5.
That is a historical low for RAD stock and makes no sense forAmerica’s sixteenth largest retailer.
Comparable sales are trending towards positive territory. Margin improvement is on the horizon thanks to an optimized store base and improving reimbursement rate trends. EBTIDA rates should start to improve. Debt is going down.
All of these are positives. And yet, Rite Aid stock trades near an all time low valuation.
I think its time to be greedy when others are fearful. The turnaround may not happen right away, but over time, this stock should head significantly higher and be a big out-performer from these depressed levels.

Bitcoin traded sideways around $41,000 early Monday while traditional markets were cautious as China kept interest rates unchanged, disappointing markets.
Hopes of a cut had increased in the wake of Vice Premier Liu He, President Xi Jinping’s top economic adviser, recent assurance that Beijing would roll out support for the Chinese economy and be cautious with measures for capital markets.
The top cryptocurrency's implied volatility trended lower, extending last week's slide, a sign of continued selling of options or volatility by sophisticated traders. ""The desk saw a tremendous amount of vol selling post-FOMC. From the highs of nearly 100%, both BTC and ETH front-end vols have dropped to 60%. A truly massive move,"" QCP Capital said in Saturday's Telegram broadcast.
One-week, one-, three- and six-month put-call skews held around 2% versus the highs around 5% to 7% before the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. The skews are down significantly from February highs of around 8%-10%, a sign of continued weakening of demand for puts or downside protection.
Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, rose nearly 2% to $2,920, having jumped 13% last week, the biggest gain in six weeks. Traders talking to CoinDesk said Ethereum's impending proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mechanism would have bullish implications for the programmable blockchain's native token, ether.
The Bored Ape Yacht Club-linked ApeCoin (APE) jumped 11% to $10.70, according to data provided by the charting platform TradingView. Leading decentralized asset management platformRibbon Finance launchedan option vault tied to APE. All holders have to do is deposit their coins in the vault, which will sell a one-week APE covered call each Friday. At press time, the projectedannualized yieldfrom the APE covered call strategy was 42%.
Other major gainers were THORChain's RUNE token, WAVES, DASH and liquid staking protocol Lido's LDO token.
""Since a portion of staking rewards are obtained as revenue for the Lido DAO, the price of their governance token (LDO) has been appreciating,"" IntoTheBlock said in the weekly newsletter published Friday.
On March 15, approximately 190,000 ETH was deposited into Lido’s stETH liquid staking, according to data tracked by the IntoTheBlock.

While bitcoin has yet to exit the downtrend on technical charts, the dollar value locked in the bitcoin futures contracts open on the Chicago Mercantile Mercantile Exchange (CME), a proxy for institutional participation, has done so.
Open interest has breached the trendline falling from November highs. In other words, the CME open interest suggests the downtrend is over.
Historically, a breakout in the CME's open interest has coincided with the end of bear runs and reversal higher in the spot market. Open interest dived out of an uptrend line at the end of April 2021, warning of an impending sell-off. Bitcoin crashed in mid-May.
Ether breakout
Ether (ETH) broke out of a multi-week contracting triangle on Friday, indicating the path of least resistance is to the higher side.
The cryptocurrency's bounce from the upper end of the triangle early today has reinforced the breakout and perhaps opened the doors for higher prices.
The immediate resistance is seen at $3,284 (Feb. 10 high).",41357.97,-0.07,41262.88,-0.29,41203.2,-0.44,40796.29,-1.42,41384.93

• Wed, January 10, 2024 at 4:14 PM UTCJosh SchaferIt might be time to your sell your I bonds, experts sayAs inflation comes down, the popular I bonds trade from the past few years isn't looking as attractive anymore.Yahoo Finance's Kerry Hannon reports:It’s a good time to sell those I bonds you bought when they became fashionable two years ago amid blisteringly hot inflation, which pumped up the annualized rate to 7.12% in November 2021 and a record 9.62% in May 2022.The lofty annual rate has since settled as inflation’s been tapped down, and the I bonds scooped up during those heady days are paying about a third of those beguiling rates, or 3.97%.Here’s why. The I bond rate is made up of a fixed rate, which applies for the 30-year life of the bond, and a semiannual variable inflation rate calculated from the six-month change in the Consumer Price Index.The annualized yield for thelatest I bondsis 5.27% — a hefty fixed rate of 1.30%, plus the 3.97% variable rate which will reset again in May.By contrast, the I bond fixed rate in November 2021 and May 2022 — when inflation was soaring — was 0%. That means those older bonds are now earning the current variable rate, period.The takeaway? Redeem and reinvest.“I personally sold my own and am advising clients to do the same,” Danielle Howard, a certified financial planner withWealth By Designin Glenwood Springs, Colo., told Yahoo Finance. “Depending on individual cash flow considerations, we are looking at money markets, laddered CD's, and corporate bond bullets.”

12196,2018-01-09 11:12:00,The 2018 Child Tax Credit Changes: What You Need to Know,"The recently passed GOP tax reform bill makes several major changes to individual tax laws in the United States. Some of the biggest changes were made to the Child Tax Credit, which affects most parents and guardians of children under 17 in the United States.
If you have children, here's what you need to know about the changes made to the Child Tax Credit for the 2018 tax year and how they could affect you.
Image source: Getty Images.
The Child Tax Credit is available to be claimed for qualified children under age 17. And you can claim it for all of your qualifying children in a given tax year. To be clear, the child must be under 17at the end of the yearto claim the credit.
For 2018, the recently passedGOP tax reform billdoubles the amount of the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per qualifying child. In other words, if you have one child, you'll be able to claim a $2,000 credit. For two children, your credit is $4,000. Three children... well, you get the idea.
It's also important to emphasize that this is acredit, not a tax deduction. While a deduction reduces the amount of your income that is subject to tax, a credit reduces your tax bill dollar-for-dollar. If you owe the IRS $5,000 for the year, and have a $2,000 tax credit, your tax bill drops to $3,000.
Another important distinction when it comes to tax credits is refundable versus nonrefundable credits. A nonrefundable credit can be used to reduce a taxpayer's bill all the way down to zero. On the other hand, a refundable tax credit can be given even if a taxpayer ends up with no tax liability at all. If your calculated tax for the year is $1,000, and you have $1,500 in refundable tax credits to claim, you can reduce your tax bill to zeroandget back that extra $500.
In a nutshell, refundable tax credits are better, especially for lower-income Americans.
So, in addition to the doubling of the Child Tax Credit amount, the tax reform bill also makes up to $1,400 of the credit amount refundable, while in previous years the Child Tax Credit was a nonrefundable credit (however, there was formerly an Additional Child Tax credit that effectively made theold Child Tax Creditrefundable). In other words, even if a taxpayer has no tax liability whatsoever, he or she can get back $1,400 for each qualifying child starting with the 2018 tax year -- and this amount will be indexed for inflation in future years.
However, the refundable portion of the credit is capped at 15% of your earned income in excess of $4,500. This effectively means that if your earned income is greater than $13,833, your refundable credit amount is only capped by the $1,400 limit, and if it is less, the refundable portion of the credit can be reduced.
The third big change to the Child Tax Credit for 2018 involves the income qualifications. In previous tax years, the credit has only been available for low- to middle-income households. For instance, the credit began to disappear in 2017 for married couples who earned more than $110,000 and for single filers with AGI above $75,000.
In 2018, the credit will be available to far more households, thanks to a massive raise in the phaseout thresholds. Here's a quick guide to the Child Tax Credit phaseout thresholds for 2018.
[{""Tax Filing Status"": ""Single"", ""Maximum AGI for Full Credit"": ""$200,000"", ""AGI Where Credit Disappears"": ""Over $240,000""}, {""Tax Filing Status"": ""Married filing jointly"", ""Maximum AGI for Full Credit"": ""$400,000"", ""AGI Where Credit Disappears"": ""Over $440,000""}, {""Tax Filing Status"": ""Head of household"", ""Maximum AGI for Full Credit"": ""$200,000"", ""AGI Where Credit Disappears"": ""Over $240,000""}, {""Tax Filing Status"": ""Married filing separately"", ""Maximum AGI for Full Credit"": ""$200,000"", ""AGI Where Credit Disappears"": ""Over $240,000""}]
Data source: GOP tax reform bill.
If your income falls between the two income thresholds for your filing status, you can still claim a partial credit. Each Child Tax Credit you qualify for will be reduced by $50 for every $1,000 your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) exceeds the lower threshold.
The tax reform bill also includes a nonrefundable $500 ""family credit"" for other dependents. Examples might include an aging parent who depends on you for care or a child whose support you provide, but is 17 years old or older.
As a final point, it's important to realize that while the Child Tax Credit is indeed going up, taxpayers are losing the personal exemption that until now has been available for every taxpayer and each of their dependents.
For 2018, before the new tax bill was passed, the personal exemption was set to rise to $4,150 per person. So, a married couple with two children would have been entitled to four of these.
The loss of the taxpayers' personal exemptions is more than offset by the big increase in the 2018 standard deduction. In the case of dependents, the new higher child tax credit helps make up the difference.
To be clear, the $1,000 in additional credit for each child will be more than the benefit from the personal exemption they would have been entitled to for many taxpayers, especially for middle-income households in the lower tax brackets and people whose incomes were formerly too high to use the credit at all. However, it's not truly ""doubled"" when you factor in the personal exemption loss.

Varietyreports thatthe rapperhas become Shazam’s all-time most searched artist.
Falling on the music platform’s 20th birthday, it announced that Drake has a record of 350 million Shazams. Among his long-running discography, “One Dance” featuringWizkidand Kyla has the most searches at more than 17 million.
While Drake took the top spot for artists, Gnarls Barkley’s “Crazy” came in as the most Shazamed song using “2580” — the app’s first version of its tool that used SMS messages to identify songs. Additionally,“Can’t Hold Us” by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis feat. Ray Dalton was the most searched song for Hip-Hop/Rap and “All of Me” byJohn Legendfor R&B/soul.
Drake’s Shazam feat comes on the heels of becomingthe artist with themost top five hits in Billboard Hot 100 history, with 30, according toBillboard.He beat out The Beatles, who have 29, thanks toDJ Khaled’s “Staying Alive” featuring himself and Lil Baby, which made his “I got more slaps than The Beatles” line a reality. The DJ Khaled track debuted at No. 5 on Billboard’s latest, Aug. 20-dated chart.
In light of making history, Drake shared his response, which included one of his other passions outside of music.
“Ok I broke my records for the month now me and @stake need you to do your thing Bitcoin,” he wrote in an Instagram post.

38001,2018-06-26 05:55:14,"Oil Price Fundamental Daily Forecast – Shortfalls from Libya, Canada Could Be Supportive","U.S. West Texas Intermediate and international-benchmark Brent crude oil futures settled lower on Monday after an early rally failed to gain traction. The market was supported by reports of an outage at Syncrude Canada’s 360,000 barrel per day oil sands facility that could last through July.
Also supporting prices was uncertainty over Libyan oil exports, but dragging prices lower was OPEC’s plan to raise output. There were also reports circulating that the United States may ask Russia to increase output in an effort to lower prices.
Crude oil futures are trading mixed early Tuesday with U.S. oil modestly higher and the international favorite slightly lower.
At 0532 GMT,August WTI crude oilis trading $68.25, up $0.17 or +0.25% andSeptember Brent crude oilis at $74.69, up $0.14 or +0.19%.
Trading in the oil market could get a little complicated over the next several days as investors continue to digest the details of last Friday’s OPEC decision to raise output. This could fuel a volatile, two-sided trade. Not only are investors trying to figure out the direction of prices, but they are also trying to determine the impact of OPEC’s move on WTI and Brent crude oil.
In addition to trying to assess the impact of the decision by OPEC to raise output, traders are also facing uncertainty around oil exports by Libya and a supply disruption in Canada.
Helping to contribute to the two-sided trade is uncertainty as to the impact of announced U.S. sanctions against Iran, and a possible tariff on U.S. imports into China. Because of this, investors aren’t sure if the output will come in north or south of about 600,000 barrels per day.
In my opinion, I think the fundamental news is supportive for higher prices, but because of last Friday’s nearly 5 percent rise, investors may be unwilling to chase prices higher at current levels. Since most of the rally was short-covering, I expect to see a short-term pullback into a value zone that should be attractive to new buyers.
I’m bullish because shortfalls from Libya and Canada were not factored into OPEC’s decision to raise output. They were primarily looking a reduced figures from Venezuela and Iran. If these conditions continue to linger then we should have a supply deficit later in the year.
Investment bank Jefferies says, “Despite the OPEC agreement we believe that tight supply is likely to drive oil prices higher during 2018.” Bank of America Merrill Lynch said tight market conditions would push Brent prices to $90 per barrel by the second quarter of 2019.
While the fundamentals appear to be supportive for a rally, gains could be limited if Russia agrees to a U.S. request to increase production. We may not know the details about this agreement, however, until U.S. President Trump meets with Russian President Putin in July.

28249,2018-04-23 11:48:00,Why You're Smart to Buy This Beaten-Up Dividend Stock,"Oil and gas experts are closely watching the Permian Basin in 2018. That's hardly surprising, considering it's the largest and fastest-growing energy play in the United States. But some are worried that it may be growing too fast. The Permian Basin has grown crude oil production from 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) entering 2014 to over 3.1 mbp today -- and that doesn't include natural gas (it's the second-largest gas play in the country) or other petroleum liquids. Current growth trends and expansion projects predict that crude oil output will rise to over 5 mpd sometime in 2023. That would be more than the entire United States produced in 2008. While production growth is great, it's possible to grow too fast. If takeaway capacity from pipelines, processing centers, and storage tanks doesn't keep pace, the region could drown in a sea of dinosaur sauce. That would tank prices in the Permian and stunt investment in new production. Luckily, pipeline operators such as Plains All American Pipeline LP (NYSE: PAA) are working to avoid such a scenario. That makes the beaten-up dividend stock worth a closer look. An oil rig at sunset. Image source: Getty Images. Analysts warn of a Permian bottleneck Multiple outlets, from The Wall Street Journal (subscription required) to Reuters , have weighed in on the potential for Permian Basin crude oil production growth to exceed pipeline capacity. According to Oilprice.com , the International Energy Agency estimates that spare pipeline capacity in the region was just 160,000 bpd at the end of 2017 and predicted that a deficit was possible in the second half of 2018. While the gap between production and takeaway capacity in the Permian Basin is certainly tight right now, numerous pipeline operators in the region are bringing new pipeline extensions on line in the near future. For instance, Enterprise Products Partners LP (NYSE: EPD) just announced that its Midland-to-Sealy pipeline for crude oil and condensate is now on line. The entire 540,000 bpd capacity is subscribed in long-term contracts, while minor expansions will boost it to 575,000 bpd next month. Another 300,000 bpd project in the Delaware Basin (part of the Permian Basin) is scheduled to come on line in July 2018. Story continues Plains All American has similarly ambitious growth plans in the Permian, but unlike Enterprise, which focuses primarily on natural gas and natural gas liquids, the company is mainly focused on crude oil. The length of its crude oil pipelines in the Permian Basin alone nearly matches that of Enterprise's entire crude oil pipeline portfolio. Pipelines shown up close. Image source: Getty Images. The company's existing footprint in America's most strategically important energy formation provides a notable opportunity to take advantage of the pending bottleneck. Plains All American Pipeline will add roughly 700,000 bpd of crude oil offtake capacity to its robust network in the Permian when its Cactus II and Sunrise extension projects come on line by the third quarter of 2019. Additional incremental expansions will come on line in the following quarter. The pipeline operator is spending $1.95 billion on growth projects across its entire North American portfolio in 2018 and 2019, with $1.61 billion contained within the Permian Basin. Most of that will be funded with a combination of $700 million in expected proceeds from asset sales and $600 million in retained cash flow. It all will be easier thanks to robust growth in operating cash flow in 2017. Plains All American Pipeline delivered $2.5 billion in cash flow from operations, supported by record volumes for its pipeline, facilities, and logistics segments. While much of that has been retained to fund capital projects and deleverage the balance sheet (aided by $1.1 billion in asset sales last year), there's considerable potential to begin returning more cash flow to shareholders in the coming years. That's not to be taken lightly: The current annualized distribution per share is $1.20 -- less than half the $2.76 per share paid out in 2015. Besides, investors that own the stock today aren't exactly getting a raw deal. Plains All American Pipeline stock trades at a favorable valuation compared to other pipeline operators, including Permian peer Enterprise: Metric Plains All American Pipeline Enterprise Products Partners Market cap $19.6 billion $57.9 billion Forward price-to-earnings ratio 14.5 16.0 PEG ratio 1.33 2.99 Enterprise value-to- EBITDA ratio 15 15.5 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Enterprise certainly earns a premium valuation thanks to its size and track record, but it's clear that Plains All American Pipeline is being weighed down by its turnaround . Nonetheless, the company has made tremendous progress reducing debt, improving profitability, and refocusing operations on core regions, such as the Permian Basin. Once the Cactus II and Sunrise extension come on line, Wall Street will have to take notice. This pipeline stock is worth the wait Analysts have warned that oil producers in the Permian Basin may encounter a production bottleneck due to a lack of takeaway capacity in the next year or two. Although there could be temporary constraints here and there, a survey of pipeline projects underway hints that the region will stave off a full-blown crisis. Plains All American Pipeline figures to be one of the biggest winners. With growth projects coming on line in the next two years, there's considerable potential to grow an already healthy distribution yield in the not-too-distant future. That expected growth, coupled with a depressed share price from the ongoing turnaround, gives long-term investors a great opportunity.

42603,2019-10-15 07:23:08,"CoinShares jointly rolls out a gold token ‘DGLD’, built on the bitcoin network","Imagine a gold product - with characteristics of physical gold and gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as the 24/7 nature and security of the bitcoin network. That was the aim of three firms behind the DGLD token.Cryptocurrency assets manager CoinShares, wallet provider Blockchain and Swiss gold trading firm MKS have jointly launched a gold token called DGLD, which is built on the bitcoin blockchain network.
The token took two years of development and is debuting with over $20 million in digitized gold, according to an announcement Tuesday. “When we embarked on the project, we had a simple aim: to ensure that we could imbue digitized gold with all of the properties traditional gold ownership comes with, without many of the physical limitations,” Daniel Masters, chairman of CoinShares, told The Block.
Masters added that the use of the bitcoin network as the security layer for DGLD makes it different from all other existing gold-backed tokens in the market. “To ensure the ‘trustless’ immutability of the DGLD blockchain and the record of gold ownership, it is linked (attested) to the Bitcoin blockchain via CommerceBlock’s Mainstay protocol. In other words - To double-spend DGLD, the Bitcoin blockchain would have to be rolled-back and re-written, which is practically impossible due to its global Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism,” Masters told The Block.
CommerceBlock is a London-based blockchain infrastructure development firm and is providing a technology stack for the DGLD token.
Each DGLD token is the digital equivalent of 1/10th of a troy ounce of gold and is vaulted in Switzerland, per the announcement. U.K.-based regulated capital markets firm Globacap is offering custody support for the token.Initially, DGLD will be available to purchase via Blockchain’s recently launched cryptocurrency exchange,The PIT. While the consortium did not specify the launch date of the token, Masters told The Block that it will be available “in the coming weeks,” adding:
“At launch, DGLD will not be available in the U.S., Canada or any sanctioned countries.” The consortium also plans to list the token on more exchanges in the future, but Masters did not disclose further details.Beyond exchanges, the token is also available via a DGLD wallet on DGLD.ch, Masters said, adding that applications will be reviewed and accepted on a case-by-case basis.
DGLD is targeted at both retail and institutional clients, although most of the $20 million gold was digitized for high-net-worth clientele, said Masters. Notably, demand as such wasn’t the key factor behind the launch of the token, as the chairman said: “We are unveiling [DGLD] to the broader public and excited to see where they take it.”
There has been a flurry of gold-based product launches in the cryptocurrency space. Just last week, cryptocurrency liquidity provider B2C2launcheda gold derivative product, which is priced and settled in bitcoin (BTC). Last month, stablecoins issuer Paxoslauncheda gold-pegged token called PAXG, which is built as an ERC-20 token on the ethereum blockchain. There is also Digix's DGX token, which is represented as 1 gram of physical gold, also on the ethereum blockchain network.",8313.41,0.0,8305.01,-0.1,8286.87,-0.32,8289.86,-0.28,8313.35
47195,2022-04-22 17:00:00,Breakthrough in public chains key to future development of on-chain perpetual contracts: Huobi Research Institute Report,"Future development of on-chain perpetual contracts will be shaped by emerging DeFi innovations and the combination of various DeFi protocols. London, UK --News Direct-- Huobi Research Institute A new report by Huobi Research Institute has flagged that the future development of on-chain crypto perpetual contracts is constrained by the performance of their underlying public chains, with a breakthrough in the latter needed for the former to thrive. Titled  On-chain perpetual contracts: Evaluating past performance and future prospects , the report also notes that the future development of on-chain perpetual contracts will be shaped by emerging DeFi innovations and the combination of various DeFi protocols. First introduced by BitMEX in 2016, crypto perpetual contracts have become a mainstay at many digital asset exchanges. They work similarly to their traditional financial market equivalents in automatically rolling over contracts for popular digital tokens such as Bitcoin. Compared with the booming off-chain perpetual contracts, on-chain perpetual contracts are developing at a slower pace. This is because perpetual contract trading is more sensitive to transaction speed and price fluctuations, requiring the higher performance of public chains. The latter is also the biggest constraint to the development of on-chain perpetual contracts at present, lagging centralized exchanges in terms of transaction experience and depth. The report provides a detailed introduction to three on-chain protocols, Perpetual Protocol which uses the virtual automatic market maker (vAMM), dYdX (off-chain match + on-chain settlement) and Injective (on-chain order book with batch auction). Comparing the risk response of each protocol, the reports evaluation shows on-chain perpetual contracts all face similar risks, including system stability risk, liquidation risk, front-running risk and protection for traders. While AMM show strong potential in the spot market, it is difficult for it to meet demand in the futures market. dYdX's compromise in its solution of ""off-chain match + on-chain settlement"" has been a great success, because it is applicable to the current situation and makes the best use of the limited infrastructure performance. With no one perpetual protocol meeting all desired attributes, the on-chain order book represented by Injective, a decentralized trading platform which uses Tendermint, appears to be the future direction of perpetual contracts development. Story continues Huobi Research Institute researcher Hugo Hou, author of the report, said: The development of the on-chain trading model has gone through several stages, from the early 0x protocol off-chain RFQ model to the AMM mechanism, and from the dYdX ""off-chain match + on-chain settlement"" approach to the on-chain order book. It can be seen that the on-chain trading paradigm has been converging with the traditional secondary market trading mode, from simple to complex, from off-chain to on-chain. Behind the transformation of the transaction mode is the evolving public chain performance, such as the maturity of Layer2 and the explosion of new public chains. Nonetheless, on-chain perpetual contracts are still in the early stages of development, which means there are many opportunities waiting to be discovered. To download the full report, click here .

This potential move followsBlackRock (BLK) partnering with Coinbase (COIN)to offer crypto trading to its institutional customers, a sign Wall Street continues to be attracted by crypto despite the horrible year for digital currency markets.
Earlier this year, Fidelity announced plans to allow corporate clients to add bitcoin to the 401(k) plans it manages for them. However, the plan has drawn criticism from theU.S. Labor Departmentand frommultiple U.S. senators.
Fidelity has more than 34.4 million individual brokerage accounts, according to the report.
Mike Novogratz, CEO of crypto investment firm Galaxy, said during a panel discussion at the SALT New York conference that he had heard Fidelity was moving to offer crypto to retail customers. The Monday panel was about institutional investment in the digital asset space.
""A bird has told me, a little bird in my ear, that Fidelity is going to shift their retail customers into crypto soon enough,"" Novogratz said. ""I hope that bird is right.""
Fidelity did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Analysts warned about the U.S. economic slowdown or recessions and renewed inflation risks. Meanwhile, the Fed rhetoric was not quite dovish. Investors started losing hope on American assets (U.S. bonds, currency and stocks).Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish FundUUP has retreated 4.3% over the past month (as of April 29, 2025).
Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that fetched sizable assets in the month of April and also highlight some that failed in the month.
Vanguard 500 Index FundVOO,Vanguard Total Stock Market ETFVTI andSPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETFSPLG hauled in $18.8 billion, $5.21 billion and $3.59 billion in assets, respectively. However,iShares Core S&P 500 ETFIVV andSPDR S&P 500 ETF TrustSPY witnessed outflows of $12.9 billion and $4.17 billion.
SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETFBIL added about $7.14 billion in assets.iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETFSGOV andVanguard Short-Term Bond ETFBSV amassed $5.51 billion and $3.77 billion, respectively. The trio yields 4.76%, 4.79% and 3.49%, respectively, annually. BIL charges 14 bps in fees while SGOV and BSV charge 9 bps and 3 bps in fees, respectively.
Ultra-short-term bonds help investors keep aside money for a couple of weeks to a few months with almost no risk.In times of market downturns, these can act as a hedge, protecting the portfolio from significant losses.
Instead of keeping excess cash idle in a low-yield bank account, investing in a cash-like ETF can enhance returns while maintaining liquidity. Moreover, BIL, BSV and SGOV are offering hefty current income at the current level. Both carry lower default and interest rate risks.
Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares ETFSOXL fetched about $3.22 billion in assets. Tech stocks drove a strong market rally last week, with Tesla, NVIDIA, and Alphabet leading the gains. This happened due to hints of trade de-escalation.
Meanwhile, the artificial intelligence (AI) boom is here to stay. Cryptocurrency summer has arrived thanks to Trump’s fascination with it. AI and crypto mining both rely heavily on semiconductors (read: Inside Best-Performing Leveraged ETFs of Last Week).

* Dollar bears unwind positions helping lift USD (Updates prices, market activity, comments to U.S. market open; previous LONDON)
By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Julien Ponthus
NEW YORK, June 18 (Reuters) - The dollar extended its advance against a basket of currencies on Friday, building on the gains logged after the U.S. Federal Reserve earlier this week surprised markets by signalling it would raise interest rates and end emergency bond-buying sooner than expected.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was up 0.38% at 92.23, its highest since mid April. That puts the index on pace for a weekly gain of about 2%, its best weekly jump in about 14 months.
The jolt to foreign exchanges was triggered on Wednesday by Fed forecasts, or 'dot plots,' showing 13 of the 18-person policy board saw rates rising in 2023, versus only six previously, with the median board member tipping two hikes in 2023.
Investors' risk appetite took another hit after St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on Friday that the U.S. central bank's shift this week towards a faster tightening of monetary policy was a ""natural"" response to economic growth and particularly inflation moving quicker than expected as the country reopens from the coronavirus pandemic.
""I think this is a direct echo of the 2013 taper tantrum. You are seeing a perceived shift in the Fed's reaction function driving investors into the safety of the U.S. dollar,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.
With investors pricing in a sooner-than-expected tapering of extraordinary U.S. monetary stimulus, the euro and the yen have come under selling pressure over the last few trading sessions.
""Essentially, the entire world was short the dollar going into this, everyone from speculative traders to corporates to investors,"" Schamotta said.
""You are seeing a wholesale unwind here,"" he said.
The unwind of sizeable bearish bets against the dollar is expected to provide support for the greenback in coming days, investors said.
With a dovish European Central Bank seemingly far behind the Fed in the monetary policy cycle, traders will be reluctant to buy euros against dollars.
""The U.S. central bank is one step ahead and as a result USD is likely to remain well supported against the EUR,"" Commerzbank strategists said in their daily note.
With equity markets hurting, the Australian dollar - seen as a proxy for risk appetite - was down 0.75% at 0.74945, its lowest since December 2020..
Sterling extended its fall against the U.S. dollar on Friday, dropping below $1.39, hurt by the Fed's hawkish surprise and an unexpected fall in Britain's retail sales.
In the world of crypto currencies, bitcoin failed to get a lift from the news that Spanish bank BBVA would open a bitcoin trading service to all private banking clients in Switzerland. Bitcoin was down 3.4% at $36,805.3.

Bitcoinsoared to nearly touch the $105,000 price mark within an hour of Trump's statement. However, it retreated to the previous zone within a few hours.
Ethereumalso neared the $2,600 mark within an hour of the statement before making a modest retreat.
As perKraken's price feed, Bitcoin was trading at $103,927 at press time. Ethereum was trading at $2,539.07 at the time of writing,as per Kraken.
Trumpwrote on Truth Socialthat the two countries negotiated a ""total reset"" in a ""friendly, but constructive"" manner. He added that the U.S. would like to see China opening up to American business. ""GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!""
However, the president didn't reveal any specific details on the progress he claimed.
The trade talks between the two countries began in Geneva, Switzerland, this weekend. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer from the U.S., and Vice Premier He Lifeng from China are holding the talks.
This is the first time that officials from both countries are meeting since Trump imposed tariff hikes on Apr. 2.
As of now, the U.S. levies a 145% tariff on Chinese imports, and China levies a 125% tariff on U.S. imports. The escalations have led to a near trade embargo.
China's official state news agency, Xinhua,said on May 10that the high-level meeting began at the request of the U.S. A ""stable and constructive"" relationship serves the interests of both nations and the world at large, it mentioned and added, ""Trade wars and tariff battles yield no winners.""",104382.0,-0.0,104395.04,0.01,104382.47,-0.0,104620.19,0.22,104385.93

But I think there’s also always a bear market somewhere. That’s because, even during good times, companies are always being hurt by new technologies, tough competition, and/or weak products. Additionally, there are always stocks whose valuations are excessive. Among the stocks currently in a bear market, likely to last for a long time, if not forever, are the major COVID-19 vaccine makers, cable TV providers, and movie theater owners. These seven stocks to sell are all in long-term bear markets and should be unloaded by investors immediately.

The ODP Corporation(NASDAQ:ODP)provides office products,including “office furniture..” and “breakroom supplies”   to businesses. It also sells cleaning and janitorial services to companies.
Although a multitude of companies are looking to limit or end the work-from-home trend, many employees are still spending considerable amounts of time working from home at this point and will likely continue to do so for many years.

As a result, “around 50% of major global companies will need less real estate in the next three years, with American cities — led by San Francisco — most exposed toempty offices,”CNNreported in June.
For obvious reasons, ODP is likely to be hit very hard by the trend. The company’s forward price-earnings ratio of 8.3 is very low, but it’s probably not low enough to account for the huge blow that the company’s business is likely to take. Thus, this is one of the top stocks to sell, at least in my book.

Boding badly forCoinbase’s(NASDAQ:COIN) chances in the pivotal lawsuit filed against it by the SEC, a huge, powerful organization and multiple legal experts”took the SEC’s side inthe litigation earlier this month,CoinDeskreported.
Specifically, the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), to which “securities regulators from all 50 U.S. states” belong, stated that “The SEC’s theory, in this case, is consistent with the agency’s longstanding public position” and “well within the bounds of established law.”
Additionally, “two academic administrative lawyers” argued in their own filing that a key part of Coinbase’s defense –its contention that only Congress can decide whether all cryptos on Coinbase except Bitcoin are securities — is completely inaccurate. One of the lawyers works for Yale Law School.
I find it hard to believe that the judge hearing the case would issue a ruling that goes against the position of the SEC, all 50 state securities regulators, and an academic administrative lawyer who works for Yale Law School.
After all, the combined experience and expertise of the regulators and the lawyers are tremendous.
It’s widely believedthat the consequencesof losing the case will be catastrophic for Coinbase. Thus, I believe it should be one of the top stocks to sell in your list.

In multiple past columns, I’ve contended thatAMC(NYSE:AMC) looks headed for disaster because it has a huge debt load, while movie theaters’ revenue is still well below their pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, due to the widespread popularity of streaming, I don’t expect the latter dynamic to change anytime soon.
But now the company has a new, potentially huge problem. Specifically, its CEO, Adam Aron, has managed to keep the company afloat and well-respected by many retail investors during the pandemic and, after that, may be forced to resign. That’s because Aron reportedlysent sexual picturesto a woman claiming to be a 17-year-old girl.
If Aron steps down, AMC may no longer be as well-loved by many retail investors. Additionally, the CEO showed great management acumen by keeping the company afloat during the pandemic and developing the idea of distributing Taylor Swift’s concert film, so losing him would be a big blow to the firm.
Moreover, his departure would distract the entire company during a critical time.

I’ve long been highly skeptical ofCassava Biosciences(NASDAQ:SAVA),citing the harsh, negative statements that many experts leveled against the company and huge issues with its “data integrity.” Given these points, I was highly skeptical about the future of the company’s Alzheimer’s drug candidate, simufilam, and I was very bearish on SAVA stock. Since the last time I wrote about SAVA,the companyhas become “the subject of ongoing federal probes.”
More evidence of highly problematic issues involving SAVA’s conduct has surfaced, as the City University of New Yorkfound that a scientistwho worked closely with the company, Hoau-Yan Wang, had committed “scientific misconduct.”
Specifically, the school discovered evidence that Wang had “improperly manipulated…images” in 20 papers that were key to establishing the notion that simufilam could be an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s,Sciencereported.
The committee added that Wang had engaged in “long-standing and egregious misconduct in data management and record keeping.” Consider it as among the stocks to sell before they tumble.

Warner Bros Discovery(NASDAQ:WBD) is one of the lesser players in the streaming wars, trailingNetflix(NASDAQ:NFLX) andDisney(NYSE:DIS). And like Disney, as an owner of cable stations and a movie-production unit, WBD is being hurt by the ongoing, widespread cord-cutting phenomenon.
But unlike Disney, WBD does not have a huge parks unit to cushion its financial results from the combined impact of cord-cutting and the decline of movie theaters.
Moreover, Warner Bros Discovery is likely to be significantlyhurt by the ongoing actors’ strike, which will probably cause the cord-cutting trend to accelerate and could increase the churn of its streaming business.
Despite all of these issues, WBD stockhas an elevatedforward price-earnings ratio of 49.5 times.

Charter Communications(NASDAQ:CHTR) is another company that is hurt by the cord-cutting trend because it provides cable TV services. For example, Charter’s cable TV customer basefell by a net total of about 200,000 in the second quarter alone.
Charter’s efforts to offer less expensive cable packages may enable it to prevent more of its TV customers from leaving but are also likely to meaningfully reduce its profit margins going forward.
While Charter did manage to add a net total of 77,000 internet customers in Q2, the churn of its internet business is likely to be high as it faces new, low-cost competition fromVerizon(NYSE:VZ) and other companies with 5G capabilities.
In Q2, the company’s overall top line rose just 0.5% versus the same period a year earlier, but I would not be surprised to see its top line start to meaningfully decline going forward.

BioNTech’s(NASDAQ:BNTX) revenue and gross profitsfrom the coronavirus vaccine onwhich it partners withPfizer(NYSE:PFE) is plunging. In August, BNTX predicted that its revenue from the shot would be roughly 5 billion euros, way below the 17.2 billion euros it received in 2022.
Additionally, the company noted that its gross profits had sunk due to write-offs on the shot taken by Pfizer. And in Q2, BioNTech’s overall revenue plunged 95% to 167.7 million euros.
Pfizer recently took $4.6 billion of write-offs on the vaccine, indicating that BioNTech’s gross profit will plunge much further in Q3 and Q4.
Moreover, Pfizer’s write-offs indicate that the overall demand for the shot is dropping tremendously, boding very badly for BioNTech and BNTX stock.

35689,2018-06-13 14:33:00,ExxonMobil Is Spending Billions of Dollars to Solve the Permian Basin's Biggest Problem,"ThePermian Basinis the gift that keeps on giving to oil companies. Since 1921, producers have pumped out more than 29 billion barrels of oil from the play. However, instead of running dry, production from the Permian is on pace to rise quickly in the coming years due to advances in shale drilling technology. In fact, some would argue that the Permian is coughing up just too much oil these days because output has risen so fast that it hasfilled pipelines to capacity, which is making it harder for producers to get crude oil off the basin. That congestion is putting pressure on regional oil prices and pinching producer profits.
ExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM)is one of the many producers contributing to this problem because the oil giant is on track to boost itsshale oil output by 18% this year. However, Exxon is also part of the solution because it plans on spending more than $2 billion to expand midstream infrastructure in the region.
Image source: Getty Images.
ExxonMobil sees the Permian Basin as a crucial growth driver over the next several years. The company currently plans to deliver a fivefold increase in output from the region by 2025, when it sees production reaching 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/D). That's a key component of the company'slong-term planto add 1 million BOE/D to its total -- boosting it up to 5 million BOE/D -- in a move that would also double earnings and cash flow.
Given that Permian pipeline capacity is filling to the brim, Exxon needs to make sure it has access to the infrastructure necessary to facilitate its growth in the region. That's why it plans to spend upwards of $2 billion on transportation and terminal upgrades over the next several years. The company is leveraging that investment by working with midstream companies to build these assets as quickly and efficiently as possible.
Image source: Getty Images.
ExxonMobil has several midstream partners lined up to help support its growth. In late 2016, it formed a strategic joint venture with Sunoco Logistics, which is now part ofEnergy Transfer Partners(NYSE: ETP), called Permian Express Partners. The joint venture combined key oil pipeline networks from both companies to help expand ExxonMobil's options in suppling Permian crude to its refineries along the Gulf Coast. The Energy Transfer-operated partnership recently placed its third Permian Express pipeline into service and could boost that 140,000-barrel-a-day (BPD) line by another 50,000 BPD if it can secure enough additional shippers to support the project.
Meanwhile, ExxonMobil's XTO subsidiary agreed to dedicate natural gas produced from two counties in New Mexico toSummit Midstream Partners(NYSE: SMLP)last July. Summit is currently investing $110 million in building out a natural gas gathering and processing system to serve new wells in that area, which should be in service this month. In addition, Summit has proposed a long-haul pipeline to move gas out of the region, which would cost up to $450 million and could help support Exxon's growing gas output from the area.
Exxon's most recent partnership is with oil pipeline giantPlains All American Pipeline(NYSE: PAA). The companies announced this week that they're pursuing the creation of a joint venture that would build a more than 1 million BPD oil pipeline from the Permian to the Gulf Coast. That project would add to the more than $2.4 billion Plains All American plans to invest in building out Permian infrastructure over the next few years to serve the growing needs of producers in the region, which are on pace to boost oil production from 3.5 million BPD this year up to an estimated 6.4 million BPD by 2023.
ExxonMobil is in the midst of an ambitious push to boost production, which will in turn double earnings and cash flow by 2025. The Permian Basin is a crucial part of that plan, which is why Exxon is working to get ahead of any potential problems by partnering with midstream companies to build the infrastructure it needs to support its growth. This strategy increases the odds that Exxon can achieve its growth objectives, which has the potential to create significant value for investors over the next several years.

44295,2021-04-22 12:13:12,Moving Average Crossover Alert: JinkoSolar,"JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd.JKS could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for JKS broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.
This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 15.4% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for JKS stock.
If that wasn’t enough, JKS isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.
Consider that in the last 30 days, 1 estimate have been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So, either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for JKS. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

37370,2018-06-22 10:31:00,Detroit Automakers Receive Good News From J.D. Power's 2018 IQS,"One of the best, and yet most difficult, things auto investors can do is research the quality and performance of vehicles. With the U.S. new-vehicle market slowing, competition will become intense and better long-term reliability and higher quality will increasingly impact consumers' purchase decisions. In other words, automakers with higher quality have a better chance to protect valuable market share and pricing -- more important than ever for automakers such asFord Motor Company(NYSE: F)andGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM).
Since it would be near impossible for any single investor to accumulate research spanning the entire industry, it's of great value to take information such as J.D. Power U.S. Initial Quality Study (IQS) and dissect it for takeaways.
J.D. Power's IQS measures the number of problems experienced per 100 vehicles spanning the first 90 days of ownership, with lower scores reflecting fewer problems and thus higher quality. Because of the study's focus on the first 90 days of ownership, the results offer investors brilliant insight into which automakers' new vehicles are improving, or regressing.
Starting from the top, overall new-vehicle quality improved 4% from 2017, reaching the best level ever, according to J.D. Power's 2018 IQS. ""There's no question that most automakers are doing a great job of listening to consumers and are producing vehicle quality of the highest caliber,"" said Dave Sargent, Vice President of Global Automotive at J.D. Power, in a press release. ""That said, some vehicle owners are still finding problems. As vehicles become more complex and automated, it is critical that consumers have complete confidence in automakers' ability to deliver fault-free vehicles.""
Ford's Mustang brought home a model-level award for quality. Image source: Ford Motor Company.
Investors of domestic automakers such as Ford and GM didn't have to dig far into the study to find positive news. All domestic automakers improved their scores faster than the industry average.Fiat Chrysler Automobilesposted the largest jump, improving its score by 7 PP100, with Ford and General Motors both registering a 5 PP100 improvement. Detroit's three automakers performed better than the industry's average 4 PP100 improvement but was outclassed by a surprising foreign group.
Genesis checked in with the highest overall IQS score of 68 PP100, followed by Kia at 72 PP100 and then Hyundai ranking third with 74 PP100. Kia is no stranger to ranking high -- this is the fourth consecutive year Kia ranked the highest of any mass market brand -- but it's the first time three Korean brands checked in at the top of the ranking.
Mazda checked in as the most-improved brand with 25 PP100 fewer problems thanthe prior 2017 study, with Mitsubishi and Cadillac reporting strong 20 PP100 and 15 PP100 improvements, respectively. Other notable improvements were Infiniti with a 15 PP100 improvement, and Hyundai and Lexus both with a 14 PP100 improvement.
Switching gears back to Detroit automakers, Ford shined in the 2018 IQS. Not only was Ford's IQS score the best it hasrecorded in the report's 32-year history, the folks at the Blue Oval received more model-level awards under its namesake brand or Lincoln than any other automaker, with five. Those five Ford vehicles were the Expedition; Mustang; Super Duty; Continental (Lincoln); MKC (Lincoln). Second most model-level awards went to Hyundai with four, and BMW and General Motors each with three.
Image source: J.D. Power's 2018 IQS
Already there is an emerging trend that will become important if automakers want to improve their score and protect market share: driver assistance systems. As the industry drives toward a driverless car future, more and more advanced driver assistance systems will be included in vehicles. Because those systems are still in the early development stages, they're causing more problems; in fact, the number of problems with driver assistance systems has increased roughly 20% each of the past three years.
And while the reality of driverless cars is far down the road, automakers that have the highest scores with driver assistance technology will have a huge advantage. To put it bluntly, what consumer in their right mind would want to purchase a vehicle that drives itself from a company with a history of low driver assist quality scores?
All in all, investors of domestic automakers Ford and GM should walk away from the 2018 IQS feeling good about the products being rolled out. While it would be difficult to pinpoint in financial data, these high quality scores should lessen the need for incentives and deals to protect sales and market share as the market plateaus. Higher quality vehicles also generate stronger new-car pricing, and retain value better in the used car markets -- all important and positive aspects for investors.

(NASDAQ: PTEN) are getting pounded on Thursday and were down more than 14% at 2:45 p.m. EST after the onshore drilling contractor reported fourth-quarter results at market open this morning. So what While the company said that revenue skyrocketed 219% year over year to $787 million -- which was $23 million ahead of expectations -- it still lost money after adjusting for a big one-time gain due to the changes in the U.S. tax law. Overall, it reported an adjusted loss of $0.10 per share, which was $0.02 per share more than the consensus estimate. It's not the only onshore contract driller to remain in the red as rival Helmerich & Payne (NYSE: HP) also didn't turn a profit last quarter after adjusting for a similar one-time boost from the tax change. That said, Helmerich & Payne did manage to beat the consensus estimate since its loss came in $0.11 per share less than analysts feared. A drilling site at sunset. Image source: Getty Images. ""Despite widespread concerns for lower industry drilling activity, our rig count rebounded through the quarter. Even with the typical holiday slowdown in Canada, our rig count at the end of the year was near the highest level of 2017,"" according to CEO Andy Hendricks. He further noted that the average rig margin per day increased $280 versus the third quarter as better pricing more than offset higher costs. That said, while the quarter was certainly a step in the right direction, investors expected more. Meanwhile, there's some concern about what lies ahead. Patterson-UTI noted that while it had 96 rigs running under contracts during the first quarter of 2018, it only had contracts supporting an average of 67 rigs for the full year. As a result, if oil prices take a tumble, Patterson's financial results could follow. Now what Despite a big uptick in shale drilling over the past year, profits remain elusive for contract drillers like Patterson-UTI and Helmerich & Payne. That tide could turn this year as long as oil prices hold up. However, investors should brace themselves for a bumpy ride, especially if oil price volatility returns.

Bitcoin (BTC) retreated to near $41,000 on Tuesday before recovering in the afternoon, while LEO, the token of crypto exchange Bitfinex, surged. U.S. officials announced they had seized roughly $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin tied to the exchange’s 2016 hack.
At the time of publication, the oldest cryptocurrency was trading at $44,187, roughly where it was 24 hours ago, according to CoinDesk data.
Bitcoin fell on Wednesday after it went as high as $45,519.24 during Asia trading hours, based on data from TradingView and Coinbase. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down slightly over the past 24 hours to just over $3,132, according to CoinDesk data.
Data compiled by CoinDesk shows that after a relatively quiet week, bitcoin’s trading volume across major exchanges has increased gradually this week.
The market chatter on Tuesday, however, centered onthe potential impactof the latest development around Bitfinex’s hack in 2016. As CoinDeskreported, the U.S. Department of Justice announced on Tuesday that it had seized some $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin tied to the breach. The number marks the largest financial seizure in history by U.S. law enforcement, according to therelease.
UNUS SED LEO token (LEO), the utility token intended to be used on Bitfinex and other trading platforms managed by its parent company iFinex, rose 40% in just 20 minutes after the news broke.
Bitfinexsaidit would buy back and burn any outstanding LEO if it recovers the stolen bitcoin within 18 months of the day of receiving this bitcoin.
Bitcoin Stalls Near Resistance; Lower Support at $40K
Bitcoin (BTC) reached a high of $45,488 over the past 24 hours, near a key resistance zone that preceded the current pullback. The cryptocurrency could find lower support at $40,000 into the Asia trading day.
The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is declining from overbought territory, similar to what occurred in late December amid a short-term downtrend. This time, however, bitcoin has broken above previous resistance levels, which means the current pullback could stabilize soon.
One concern is the low conviction among buyers, evidenced by low trading volume during the prior price rally. Low volume rallies typically result in pullbacks or range-bound trading before a more definitive price bottom is confirmed.

27058,2018-04-15 13:35:00,The Worst Airlines in the U.S. Are Getting a Lot Better,"Most air travelers would agree thatSpirit Airlines(NYSE: SAVE)and Frontier Airlines are the worst airlines in the U.S. in terms of service quality. The two ultra-low-cost carriers offer rock-bottom fares, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.
However, executives at Spirit and Frontier are trying to change the public's negative perception of their companies. The recently released 2018 Airline Quality Rating report shows that they have made significant progress in improving their operations during the past year. In the long run, smoother operations at these ultra-low-cost carriers could be bad news forAmerican Airlines(NASDAQ: AAL)andUnited Continental(NYSE: UAL).
The annual Airline Quality Rating study scores airlines based on four objective criteria related to customer service. These are: (1) on-time performance, (2) the rate of involuntary denied boardings (i.e., passengers getting ""bumped"" from flights), (3) the frequency with which checked bags are lost or delayed, and (4) the percentage of customers who file official complaints with the U.S. Department of Transportation.
Airlines' performances in these four categories are aggregated into a single score. Each score is a negative number, with results closer to zero representing better performance.
The objective metrics used in the annual Airline Quality Rating reports show that Spirit Airlines and Frontier Airlines have earned their poor reputations. In 2015, Spirit Airlines was last in the industry with a score of negative 3.18. Frontier Airlines' score was negative 2.60. No other carrier scored worse than negative 1.73.
Spirit and Frontier frequently rank last in the airline industry for customer service. Image source: Spirit Airlines.
In 2016,both ultra-low-cost carriers improved, with Frontier Airlines scoring negative 2.24 and Spirit Airlines vaulting ahead of it with a score of negative 2.01. However, the goalposts moved. The next-worst score was negative 1.36, meaning that Frontier and Spirit remained far behind all of their rivals.
The 2018 Airline Quality Rating report, which came out last week, showed that Spirit Airlines and Frontier Airlines remained at the back of the pack. However, both carriers improved their performances significantly. Spirit Airlines scored negative 1.66, while Frontier improved its score all the way to negative 1.23, putting it within striking distance of regional airline ExpressJet at negative 1.06 and American Airlines at negative 1.03.
A look at the individual metrics reveals that on-time performance improved at both Frontier and Spirit last year, bucking the trend for the rest of the industry. In terms of mishandled baggage, Spirit Airlines was actually the best in the business, while Frontier was near the middle of the pack.
The main reason both ultra-low-cost carriers still rank at the bottom overall is that they have a much higher rate of official complaints -- especially Spirit. This is largely due to the nature of their business models: Their extensive fees for ""optional services"" can irritate new customers who don't understand what is (and is not) included in the base fare. Spirit Airlines and Frontier Airlines also tend to bump passengers more frequently than other airlines.
The quality improvements at Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines were even more obvious toward the end of 2017. For example, both carriers scored better than American Airlines in the month of December.
Delta Air Linesis routinely near thetop of the airline industryin terms of service. This has helped it attract customers without matching the lowest fare on every route. By contrast, United Continental and American Airlines have been slightly below average in recent years. As a result, they are increasingly relying on low fares to keep their planes full.
Indeed, in the past few years, American and United have started to aggressively match the prices of rivals like Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines. Executives at United have been particularly vocal in promoting this strategy. Last year, CFO Andrew Levy and President Scott Kirby both commented that nobody likes flying on Frontier or Spirit. The implication was that matching ultra-low-cost fares would undermine those carriers' whole reason for existence.
However, the recent quality improvements at Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines will make it that much harder to defeat these pesky rivals. To be fair, American Airlines and United Continental are also improving their quality scores, but Frontier and Spirit may be good enough for many travelers at this point. Meanwhile, price-matching has hurt profitability at both American and United just as much as it has hurt the ultra-low-cost carriers.
Spirit Airlines and Frontier Airlines are never going to provide a luxurious experience. But if they continue to get better at running on time and offering courteous service, it will be virtually impossible for rivals like American Airlines and United Continental to stop their growth.

28018,2019-04-21 02:09:19,"The Week Ahead – Brexit, Earnings, Stats and Monetary Policy are in Focus","It’s a quieter week ahead for the Greenback.
Through the first part of the week, March existing home sales and new home sales figures are due out on Monday and Tuesday.
The numbers are unlikely to have a material influence, with sentiment towards the housing sector having seen a marked improvement of late.
Data due out in the 2ndhalf of the week will have a more material impact on the Dollar and risk sentiment. March durable goods orders are due out on Thursday, with 1stquarter GDP numbers due out on Friday.
While softer numbers are expected, due to the extended government shutdown, anything worse than forecasted will hit risk appetite hard.
Outside of the figures, expect earnings and geopolitical risk to also impact the Dollar in the week.
The Dollar Spot Index ended the week up 0.42% to $97.378.
Economic data includes flash consumer confidence figures out of the Eurozone on Tuesday, which are released ahead of Germany business confidence numbers on Wednesday.
Of less material influence will be French jobseeker figures on Friday.
In a shortened week, European markets closed on Monday, business confidence figures will likely have the greatest impact.
The EUR/USD ended the week down 0.48% to $1.1245.
It’s a quiet week ahead. Key stats are limited to CBI Industrial Trend Orders due out on Thursday.
Barring a material move from March’s figure, which was the weakest since May 2018, there’s unlikely to be too much impact on the Pound.
MP’s return to Westminster on Tuesday and Theresa May will be on a mission to wrap up an exit solution before the EU Parliamentary elections.
Indicative votes could be on the cards in the week.
The GBP/USD ended the week down 0.62% at $1.2993.
It’s a quiet week ahead on the data front, with key stats limited to wholesale sales figures due out on Tuesday.
A material jump in sales would provide support for the Loonie, though the main event will be on Wednesday. The Bank of Canada will deliver its April monetary policy decision and report ahead of the customary press conference.
With the U.S – China trade war ongoing, there’s little incentive for the BoC to change tact. They will likely remain dovish, joining a string of banks that have raised concerns over the economic outlook.
The Loonie ended the week down 0.51% to C$1.3391 against the U.S Dollar.
It’s a quiet week ahead. 1stquarter inflation and wholesale inflation figures are due out on Wednesday and Friday respectively. Following the latest RBA minutes and uncertainty over the economic outlook, this week stats will have a material impact on the Aussie Dollar.
Outside of the numbers, corporate earnings will remain in focus to drive sentiment towards the global economic outlook, which will also influence commodities and the Aussie Dollar.
The Aussie Dollar ended the week down 0.29% to $0.7152.
It’s a relatively busy week ahead. March retail sales and prelim industrial production numbers are due out on Friday. Earlier in the Friday session, April inflation figures will also be released, though the numbers are unlikely to have an impact on the Yen.
We can expect the markets to respond to the retail sales and production figures, both of which are key to economic growth.
On the policy front, the BoJ will deliver its April policy decision, though few surprises are anticipated.
The Japanese Yen ended the week up 0.09% to ¥111.92 against the U.S Dollar.
Another quiet week ahead leaves March trade data due out on Friday to provide direction.
Market risk sentiment will influence ahead of the numbers.
The Kiwi Dollar ended the week down 1.17%% to $0.6684.
There are no material stats due out. Updates on the U.S – China trade could hit the news wires in the week, however.
U.S – China Trade War:  The markets will be hoping that the talking is done and an agreement is made. With the U.S President incentivized to deliver, there could be some good news in the week. Though it might not be great for everyone…
Brexit: Lawmakers return from the Easter break and Theresa May will be looking to resume talks. Indicative voting may be the way forward in fishing out a supported deal. Cross-party talks may have caused more harm than good…
On the monetary policy front,
For the Loonie, The BoC will deliver its monetary policy decision on Wednesday. While few are expecting a move, the dovish tone may well persist at the press conference.
For the JPY, the BoJ will deliver its monetary policy decision on Thursday. While it’s not been bells and whistles for the Japanese economy, it may be too soon for the BoJ to make a move… There is the threat of U.S tariffs after all.
U.S Corporate Earnings:Corporate earnings will pack a punch in the week ahead. Some of the key releases include those for:

12415,2021-02-17 12:00:00,"Currency Exchange International, Corp. (CXI) starts selling Bitcoin and Ethereum powered by Cyclebit and CEX.IO","A new in-person concierge service for buying cryptocurrencies
ORLANDO, Fla., Feb. 17, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --Currency Exchange International, Corp.

Customers can purchase Bitcoin and Ethereum in less than 10 minutes at select CXI branch locations starting February 17, 2021.
Purchasing Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency can be intimidating because the concept of Bitcoin is complex and vastly different from traditional fiat currencies and physical assets like gold - both of which you can see and touch. Others are hesitant to provide the regulatory required “Know Your Customer” (KYC) information to new or unregulated entities for their first purchase.
The number of Americans who own cryptocurrencies almost doubled in 2019, from 7.95% in 2018 to 14.4%, and continues to grow as the price of Bitcoin surges. Currently, the most popular way to purchase crypto is online through cryptocurrency exchanges or offline through crypto ATM's. The goal of this new offering by CXI is to expand access to this emerging asset class by providing a safe, transparent and trusted process to buying cryptocurrencies - in person.
CXI customers will be able to purchase directly from tellers at brick-and-mortar locations across the United States. CXI is set to accept cash, debit cards, and credit cards for customers buying Bitcoin and Ethereum. In addition, the first 1,000 customers will receive a free NFC enabled hardware wallet to store and manage their crypto. The initial in-branch pilot program launches at 12 CXI locations across the United States. ""Adding digital currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum to our long list of currencies that we offer was a natural evolution. We are excited to be working with Cyclebit and CEX.IO to be able to offer this new asset class to our US customers,"" says Randolph Pinna, CEO of Currency Exchange International.
“A concierge service by a trusted brand like CXI for purchasing cryptocurrencies is the type of initiative that will push the adoption and acceptance of cryptocurrencies,” echoed Sameer Pirani, CEO of Cyclebit.
“CEX.IO is a worldwide leader in digital asset trading, and we are excited to partner with strong, regulated companies like CXI and innovative technology providers such as Cyclebit to bring physical crypto purchases to the retail public, thereby engaging a whole new population in the growing worldwide financial paradigm of digital assets,” said Alexander Kravets, CEO of CEX.IO US.

47219,2022-11-07 13:14:46,Chats That Toppled Kurz Roil Austrian Media in Latest Fallout,"(Bloomberg) -- Editors at two major Austrian news organizations were suspended after text messages in the possession of public prosecutors showed them cozying up to senior government officials. Most Read from Bloomberg Twitter Now Asks Some Fired Workers to Please Come Back Elon Musk Tells Twitter Followers to Vote for a Republican Congress Elon Musk Walks Back on Twitter Job Cuts, Blue Checks in Second Week Billions in Capital Calls Threaten to Wreak Havoc on Global Stocks, Bonds Twitter Fires More Than 90% of India Staff, Leaving Just a Dozen The announcements are the latest fallout from a wide-ranging corruption probe with origins in the so-called Ibiza video that toppled Sebastian Kurzs government in 2019 and led to his departure from politics in 2021. Messages confiscated from the phone of Thomas Schmid, the Finance Ministrys top civil servant, as well other senior officials, have roiled Austrians by showing them the inner dealings between government and business. Prosecutors are investigating multiple alleged accounts of corruption based on the messages. After the most recent revelations, Styria Media Group AG suspended Rainer Nowak from his duty as editor-in-chief of Vienna daily newspaper Die Presse. Messages sent between 2017 and 2019 appeared to show him seeking Schmids help for a senior position at the countrys public broadcaster ORF. Messages also suggested that the longtime executive was asked to intervene in stories at the request of Schmid, according to texts first published by Der Standard newspaper. Nowak apologized in a statement for the inappropriate tone of the messages but said the conversations were never reflected in stories published by the paper. Separately, Matthias Schrom went on leave as news director of ORF after discussing the perceived influence of the Social Democratic Party on public media with Heinz-Christian Strache, who led the the right-wing populist Freedom Party and was Austrias vice chancellor at the time. Story continues ORF said that Schrom wrote in a letter to the newsroom that Straches interventions didnt affect editorial decisions and came amid a time of great political pressure on the channel.

58693,2022-06-27 03:51:17,Harmony Protocol Offers $1M Bounty Following Massive Exploit,"• Harmony’s Horizon bridge was exploited for $100M on Friday.
• The team’s 1% bounty may not be enough incentive for the attackers.
• The funds remain in the hacker’s wallet and have yet to be moved or ‘cleaned.’
Late last week, the high-throughput layer-1 blockchain platform Harmony became the latest victim of a bridge exploit. Around $100 million in various crypto assets were stolen from the protocol due to a vulnerability in a multi-signature wallet connected to the Horizon bridge. The bridge allows assets to be transferred to and from Harmony and other networks such as Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC).
On June 26, the Harmony team offered a million-dollar bounty for the return of the funds. It also promised to advocate for no legal charges.
The theft makes Harmony the fourteenth-largest industry exploit, according to Defiyield’s Rektdatabase(which has yet to be updated).  However, the 1% bounty is one of the smallest offered so far, so they may have to up the incentive a little to have any hope of funds being returned.
At the time of writing, the funds were still in the hacker’saddresswhich held 85,867ETHworth approximately $104.6 million. If the assets start moving to anonymizing services such as Tornado Cash, Harmony can kiss goodbye any hopes of retrieval.
There was plenty of reaction from the crypto community, with many suggesting that the amount offered was too low. Others pointed out that providing bounties doesn’t solve the problem and, if anything, may even encourage hackers.
“Isn’t it funny to actually reward the hackers with $1M dollars for returning the fund when they can get away with $100M?” onecommentedbefore adding, “even if they accept the offer, the same hackers will and again comprise another system? Problem isn’t solved.”
The exploit, which resulted from a private key breach, not a smart contract bug, is the latest cross-chain bridge attack this year. On June 26, Harmony stated:
“The team has found evidence that private keys were compromised, leading to the breach of our Horizon bridge. Funds were stolen from the Ethereum side of the bridge.”
The attacker was able to access and decrypt a number of these keys and use them to sign unauthorized transactions, it added.
Hackers have been increasingly targeting these conduits between different networks. In February, hackers stole $320 million from the Wormhole bridge; then, the following month came the industry’s largest attack. More than $600 million was stolen in an attack on Axie Infinitie’s Ronin bridge in March.
Harmony’s native token,ONE, is still in decline, having lost more than 12% since the attack. It was down around 5.3% on the day, trading at $0.023 during the Monday morning Asian trading session.
ONE has lost 42% over the past month and has collapsed 94% from its October all-time high of $0.379.

To say thatTesla(NASDAQ:TSLA) is a founder-led stock is a bit of a misnomer.While Elon Musk is very much the driving force at theelectric vehicle (EV)manufacturer, the company was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning inJuly 2003. Musk came along in April 2004, investing $6.35 million in Series A funding. He became CEO in October 2008.
As for the company, it continues to deliver loads of EVs. In the first quarter of 2022, it delivered310,048 EVs, most of which were the Model 3 and Model Y. As for profits, it generated$2.2 billionin free cash flow in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, 660% higher than a year earlier. It has generated positive free cash flow in 11 of the past 12 quarters. It finished the quarter with $17.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet.
Tesla currently trades at13.1x sales, higher than its five-year average, but lower than its multiple over the past couple of years.

Jensen Huang has beenNvidia’s(NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO since founding the company in 1993. Nvidia went public inJanuary 1999at $12 per share. Even though NVDA stock is down 41% year-t0-date, Huang has still managed to generate a cumulative total return of 23,156% since its initial public offering over 23 years ago.
In January, I suggested that Nvidia stock could be one of2022’s best bets. While it hasn’t worked out this way, the company continues to deliver great quarterly results. Even though it likely won’t hit $400 in 2022, Huang remains entirely in control.
For thefirst timein the company’s history, its data center revenue of $3.75 billion in Q1 2023 was higher than its gaming revenue of $3.62 billion. Its data center revenues grew 83% over Q1 2022 and 15% from Q4 2022.
Nvidia trades at16.3xsales, slightly less than its five-year average of 17.3. All of its major financial metrics are lower than in previous years due to its 2022 correction.

Salesforce(NYSE:CRM) Co-CEO Marc Beniofffounded the cloud-based software company in 1999. Benioff believes that companies have a responsibility to not only create great products, but also make a positive impact on the world.CNN Businessnamed Benioff its top CEO of 2020.
Recently, as a result of the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, 4,000 Salesforce employees signed anopen letterto Benioff and Co-CEO Bret Taylor, requesting that the company drop the National Rifle Association (NRA) as a customer.
I would think that Benioff would be open to meeting the employees’ requests. In 2019, it banned customers from using its software if they were selling certain types of firearms.
Despite Benioff’s focus on bettering the world, Salesforce’s business hasn’t suffered. In Q1 2023, its sales grew 24% year-over-year to$7.41 billion. On the bottom line, adjusted net income was $982 million, 14% lower than Q1 2022.
As for free cash flow, it was $3.5 billion in the first quarter, 14% higher than a year earlier. Its free cash flow for the trailing 12 months through Q1 2023 is$5.7 billion, the highest in its history.

Blackstone(NYSE:BX) wasfounded in 1985by Steven Schwarzman and Pete Peterson. Both were former Lehman Brothers veterans. The company went public in 2007, selling $4 billion of its shares. Today, it’s one of, if not the largest, alternative asset managers in the world, with $915 billion in assets under management.
Schwarzman remains CEO despite being well into his 70s. I guess if Warren Buffett can do it into his 90s, the Blackstone founder has lots of years ahead of him.
Blackstone’s assets under management are invested under four primary platforms: Real Estate ($298 billion), Private Equity ($268 billion), Hedge Fund Solutions ($83 billion), and Credit & Insurance ($266 billion). Companies owned by its private equity business include Ancestry, Refinitiv, and SERVPRO.
In the last 12 months through the first quarter, its net income was $5.3 billion, 38% higher than a year earlier. Its assets at the end of the first quarter were 41% higher than a year earlier, as well.

Current CEO Mark Millett co-foundedSteel Dynamics(NASDAQ:STLD) in 1993. He has been CEO since January 2012 and owns 1.5% of the company’s stock.
The steel maker produced lots ofrecords in Q1 2022, includingrecord steel shipments, net sales, operating income and net income. It also had record cash flow in the quarter, providing it with free cash to buy back its shares. It bought back 3% of its stock in Q1 2022 alone.
There is no question the company is benefiting from high steel prices. In Q1 2022, it got$1,561 per tonof steel, 50% higher than a year earlier.
How can you tell that the business is operating at maximum efficiency? The five-year average free cash flow between 2016 and 2021 was $1.5 billion, almost 3x the five-year average between 2011 and 2015.With the company’s new Texas electric arc furnace flat roll steel mill up and running, it’s expected to grow its annual steel production by 25%. That will lead to even greater free cash flow in the years to come.

Block(NYSE:SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey co-founded the company inJuly 2009. In April 2022, his title changed from CEO to Block Head. Dorsey also served as CEO ofTwitter(NYSE:TWTR) before stepping down inNovember 2021. In May, he also stepped down from the social media platform’s board.
In December, I suggested that Dorsey focusing solely on Block wouldpay dividendsfor shareholders. Down 55% year-to-date, SQ stock hasn’t cooperated so far. In the long-term, I have no doubt Dorsey will deliver for shareholders.
NorthStar Asset Management, a Block shareholder, has proposed that the company give up its super-voting shares. It will be voted on at the company’s mid-June shareholder’s meeting. It was on last year’s annual meeting vote, but only got20% support.
Although Dorsey and co-founder Jim McKelvey own less than 11% of Block stock, they control more than 48% because of the dual-class share structure. As we’ve seen withShopify(NYSE:SHOP), it can be a hot-button issue with shareholders.

Apollo Global Management(NYSE:APO) CEO Marc Rowan co-founded the high-growth alternative asset manager in 1990. At the end of March, it had$513 billionin assets under management, with its Yield business accounting for 73% of those assets.
The company believes that a properly constructed investment portfolio should include 20% to 30% of its assets in alternatives, with equities and fixed income accounting for 40% and 30%, respectively.
Over the next five years, Apollo expects to double its assets under management to $1 trillion, with a majority of those assets focused on its Yield business.In fiscal-year 2022, it expects fee-related earnings of $1.4 billion, with a total adjusted net income of $3.3 billion or $5.50 a share. That’s a reasonable 10.5x its 2022 earnings.
In early January, Apollo completed itsmergerwith Athene Holdings. Apollo now has two operating subsidiaries: Apollo Asset Management, which manages alternative investments, and Athene, which specializes in retirement and reinsurance services.

By Tom Westbrook
SINGAPORE, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Chinese internet stocks slumped on regulatory news on Friday to drag Asian stocks down for the final full trading week of the year, while the dollar wobbled ahead of U.S. inflation data that's expected to validate bets on rate cuts in 2024.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gave up gains to trade flat after China issued a draft of rules that would impose spending limits on gamers. For the week the index is down 0.2%.
Netease lost 12% and Tencent fell 7%, pulling the Hang Seng 0.4% lower. Banking shares helped Japan's Nikkei rise 0.2%. The euro poked above $1.10.
Outside Asia, markets have been in a festive mood for weeks as inflation data around the world has showed a slowdown and the Federal Reserve signalled it was done raising interest rates.
Two-year U.S. Treasury yields are down almost 38 basis points in a week and a half and fell 2 bps overnight when third-quarter U.S. core PCE inflation was revised down to 2%.
The data has markets girding for a downside surprise on the last key number before Christmas, November's personal consumption expenditure index, due at 1330 GMT with consensus expectations for a monthly increase of 0.2%.
""Analysts are confident it shouldn't be higher than 0.2%,"" said National Australia Bank's head of currency strategy Ray Attrill in Sydney.
""Could we get 0.1%? It'd probably take a 0.1% to see and extension of the moves we have seen.""
Overnight U.S. stocks bounced back from a sudden slide at the end of Wednesday's session and the S&P 500 rose 1%.
The index is within 2% of its record high.
S&P 500 futures dipped 0.1% in Asia and Nike shares slid almost 12% in after-hours trade after the company cut its sales forecast, blaming cautious consumers.
European futures were flat.
Oil is set for a weekly gain on nervousness about the security of Red Sea shipping, but prices fell overnight after Angola said it would quit OPEC, raising questions about the producer group's efforts to limit global supply.
Brent crude futures were up 58 cents to $79.97 a barrel in Asia trade on Friday, for a weekly gain of 4.5%.
TALE OF TWO HAVENS
In currency trade the dollar has come under pressure from markets' expectation of more than 150 bps of rate cuts in 2024.
At $1.1002 the euro is up 1% this week, even though a similar amount of cuts are priced in for Europe next year. The common currency is also up about 1% against sterling, which fell sharply this week after a surprise dive in inflation.
Sterling was set for its biggest weekly drop on the euro and against the Aussie dollar for three months. It last bought $1.2686 and traded at 86.71 pence per euro.
The dollar index is down 0.7% this week to 101.85. For the year it is down 2.4%. Among G10 currencies the best performer of the year was the Swiss franc, up nearly 8% on the dollar, while the yen's 7.8% drop made it the worst.
NAB's Attrill noted the mirror moves of the two so-called ""safe haven"" currencies underscored the overwhelming influence of the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) monetary policy. It has stuck with negative interest rates while the rest of the world has hiked.
Policymakers debated communication around an eventual exit from such settings in December, meeting minutes showed on Friday. But data showing a slowdown in the pace of Japan's core inflation takes off some of the pressure to hurry.
The dollar rose marginally to 142.43 yen on Friday.
Gold is set to end the week and the year ahead, with a 12% gain so far this year to $2,049 an ounce.
Bitcoin is up 160% this year to $44,114.

33220,2018-05-26 15:26:00,6 Unusual Things You Probably Didn't Know About Alibaba,"Alibaba(NYSE: BABA)is widely known as the ""Amazonof China"" simply because it's the largest e-commerce company in China.
But Alibaba is much more than an online retailer. The company has been aggressively diversifying its revenue sources in an effort to become an ecosystem for customers to spend their money on everything from grocery delivery to concert tickets.
Alibaba's revenuegrew an incredible58% year over year for the fiscal year ended in March and it expects to post 60% revenue growth for the 2019 fiscal year. Because Alibaba is so large and its main source of revenue comes from its China-based online shopping platforms, it's not often that you hear about the company's side projects. So here are six of Alibaba's smaller initiatives that you've probably heard little or nothing about.

In the fall of 2017, Alibaba announced a new partnership with New York Fashion Week (NYFW).
As part of the deal, Alibaba selected two U.S. brands from NYFW to feature in its second annual ""See Now, Buy Now"" fashion show. This was valuable for U.S. brands because the fashion show is broadcast to Alibaba's more than 500 million monthly active users who can buy the clothing with a simple click during the broadcast. In return, NYFW agreed to showcase selected Chinese designers at its ""NYFW: China Day"" event in September 2018.
During the 2017 ""See Now, Buy Now"" show, consumers could click ""Buy Now"" to pre-order the fashion show's clothing through Alibaba's shopping platforms. The purchase was actually completed on Nov. 11 as part of Alibaba's annual Singles Day sales extravaganza. Last year, Alibaba did$25 billion in saleson that one day.
Alibaba has also partnered with other fashion weeks, including a recent partnership with Shanghai Fashion Week that allowed the event to use Alibaba'sNew Retailtechnology. This included the use of facial recognition as admission to events, as well as a foot traffic heat map to determine which brands and shows captured the most interest.
Alibaba's $73 ""Genie X1"" Chinese voice control assistant launched this past August. In the latest earnings call for the quarter ended in March, Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang said the company had sold more than 2 million units so far.
You might know that Alibaba bought a 60% controlling stake in a Hong Kong-based movie and TV production company back in 2014 and renamed it Alibaba Pictures.
But what you might not know is that Alibaba Pictures recently released a short martial arts film calledGong Shou Daothat stars none other than Alibaba founder Jack Ma. The film follows Ma as he competes with martial-arts masters around the globe and also stars famed martial artist and actor Jet Li.
In a further push into the entertainment business, Alibaba purchased China's largest online entertainment ticketing platform Damai.cn in early 2017. Damai was founded in 2004 and sells tickets to theater shows, sporting events, concerts, and movies in China.
In addition, Alibaba Pictures has an online ticketing business known as Tao Piaopiao (piaomeans ticket in Chinese). The platform has been an official marketing and promotions partner for a number of hit movies, including Indian blockbusterDangaland Christopher Nolan'sDunkirk. While Tao Piaopiao's revenue jumped 189% to $311 million in 2017, heavy investments and expenses related to it led to a loss of $55 million for the year.
Alibaba currently gets over 70% of its revenue from its core China commerce retail businesses. That's why it's working on its international growth, including the May 2018 purchase of Pakistani e-commerce firm Daraz to help its South Asia growth story. Founded in 2012, Daraz also operates in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Nepal.
Ma believes consumers want a better system to test drive and buy cars. That's why Alibaba partnered withFord(NYSE: F)to unveil China's first car vending machine in early 2018 in Guangzhou. The seven-level vending machine is called The Super Test Drive Center and offers three-day test drives to potential buyers.
To use the unstaffed car vending machine, consumers simply pick a model and pick-up time from Alibaba's shopping app and snap a selfie so their identity can be confirmed by a machine at the test drive center. If they like the car and have a good credit score, they can purchase the car by themselves in just a few minutes.
This is the first collaboration between Alibaba and Ford as part of a three-year partnership deal.

23692,2019-04-02 22:42:59,Paypal’s First Blockchain Bet: Digital Identity,"Paypal has made a relatively small (for a $120+ billion company) in Cambridge Blockchain, which is a company focused on digital identity.
Cambridge Blockchain is working on a product that will amount to a digital passport: the user will be able to have strict control of who uses their data, but also be able to use it to verify themselves. The investment gives a clear picture of how Paypal, who allow people to send, receive, and store money without the need of a bank (and even use ATM services through their debit card), might use the blockchain in the future.
Rumors of Paypal integrating Bitcoin payments have circulated for years, but the company has never really gone the whole way with cryptocurrency. Back in 2015, they enabled Bitcoinpayments through Braintree, a company they acquired in 2013. A search of Braintree’s website today for “Bitcoin” returns no results.
Now they’ve made their first investment in a blockchain company that’s not focused on cryptocurrency at all. The dollar is still king at Paypal.
A Paypal representative toldForbes:
“We made an investment in Cambridge Blockchain because it is applying blockchain for digital identity in a way that we believe could benefit financial services companies including PayPal.”
Besides gambling and value transfers, one of the primary use cases for decentralized ledger technologies is the secure issuance and usage of virtual documents. Things like land/auto titles, university degrees, and other types of credentials are ripe for a digital solution.

86321,2024-07-26 07:57:18,Trump Campaign Surges with $3 Million in Crypto Donations in Q2 2024,"Donald Trump's reelection campaign has received approximately $3 million in digital assets contributed since the former president announced he would accept such donations. According to a Federal Election Commission (FEC) filing for the second quarter of 2024, the Trump 47 Committee received these crypto contributions from around 20 individuals starting in May. The FEC filing did not cover contributions from July or crypto donations to other committees.
Among the most significant donors were Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who pledged a combined $2 million in Bitcoin on June 20. Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell committed $1 million in Ether on June 28. FEC records show Powell's contribution exceeded $844,000, while the Trump campaign had to partially refund the Winklevoss twins' Bitcoin donation due to contribution limits, which cap individual donations at $844,600.
Ryan Selkis, the former CEO of Messari, who resigned on July 19 after making controversial statements on social media, contributed $50,000 in USDC. Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, donated $300,000 in XRP. Despite Alderoty’s significant contribution, his social media activity has not indicated support for Trump, though he has been a vocal critic of the Securities and Exchange Commission and its chair, Gary Gensler, under the Biden administration.
The Trump 47 Committee reported raising over $118 million in both cryptocurrency and fiat for the second quarter, contributing to a total of more than $142 million for 2024. While there were rumors that President Joe Biden might accept crypto donations for his reelection campaign, he announced on July 21 that he would not seek another term, instead endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris.

More Provably Fair and NFT-Based Games
Blockchain tech will usher in new styles of games, including NFT-based gambling, decentralized betting platforms, and real-time fair-play tracking.

Look for casinos to launch crypto-native apps with mobile wallets, quick swaps, and even on-chain rewards systems.
The future is bright—and crypto casinos are at the center of the evolution.

45498,2020-12-18 17:20:13,Ruffer Investment Used Coinbase to Execute $745M Bitcoin Buy,"When Ruffer Investment wanted bitcoin in November it turned to One River Digital, which went to Coinbase to hit the “buy” button on a purchase now worth over $745 million, Ruffer representative Jonathan Atkins confirmed to CoinDesk.
In a recent portfolio update, Ruffer alluded to the involvement of the “world’s largest custodian of digital assets” without naming names. “Access to the bitcoin is controlled by multi-layer security protocols,” Ruffer wrote of its cold-storage setup. A second source confirmed to CoinDesk that Coinbase was the custodian described in Ruffer’sportfolio update. Coinbase Custody announced last month it was storing over$20 billionin customer assets.
The revelation sheds light on how large investors are entering thebitcoinmarket: namely through trusted partners. Big bets in recent weeks by everyone fromMassMutualtoGuggenheimare seen as the driving force behind bitcoin’s current price rally. (MassMutual went withNYDIGfor its $100 million bitcoin buy.)

As CoinDesk reported Tuesday, Rufferinvested2.5% of its $27 billion portfolio into bitcoin in November. The following day, One River Digital, a crypto-focused offshoot of volatility hedge fund One River Asset Management,came out of stealth, proclaiming it had already brokered $600 million in bitcoin andetherfor its institutional clients.
Coinbase confirmed on Wednesday it was conducting trade execution and crypto custody for One River Digital. It declined to comment for this story.
Ruffer owns a stake in One River Digital. Billionaire hedge fund manager Alan Howard does as well. One River Digital did not respond to a request for comment.
The Ruffer revelation shows just how far San Francisco’s Coinbase is reaching into the world of fund management.

Earlier this month, itrevealeditself as the “primary execution partner” for MicroStrategy’s $425 million bitcoin purchase in the fall. Acase studypublished by Coinbase explained how the firm pulls off market-swamping allocations without alerting traders.
Coinbase is now readying itself for a Wall Street debut. On Thursday, as bitcoin continued to race past its $20,000 ceiling into new all-time highs, the exchangeannounced it had confidentially filed for an initial public offeringwith U.S. regulators.
Meanwhile, Ruffer explained in its portfolio update that macroeconomic factors guided the manager’s bitcoin bet.
“The current macroeconomic environment is set up perfectly for an asset that blends the benefits of technology and gold,” Ruffer said, adding:
“Negative interest rates, extreme monetary policy, ballooning public debt, dissatisfaction with governments – all provide powerful tailwinds for bitcoin at a time when conventional safe-haven assets, particularly government bonds, are perilously expensive.”
Ruffer said bitcoin has grown to meet this moment.
“Since 2017, billions of dollars have been invested in the infrastructure needed to support this wave of bitcoin adoption; many of the impediments to institutional investors have been dismantled.”
Ruffer’s analysis was clear: the institutions are here with more on the way; the cypherpunks are fading fast. Wrote the $27 billion mega-manager:
“[Bitcoin] seems set to move from being loved by the anti-establishment to being embraced by the dominant interests of the establishment.”

58014,2020-09-14 13:40:58,The Crypto Firms Collaborating on a Swiss Franc Stablecoin,"The folks building the next generation of digital money in Switzerland understand the need to collaborate.
Stablecoins, digital tokens pegged one-to-one to the Swiss franc (CHF) in this case, are a prime example. SEBA Bank and Sygnum Bank, the two B2B players that hold banking licenses from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority and that specialize in digital assets, are both involved in stablecoin explorations, as is the country’s respected crypto conglomerate, Bitcoin Suisse.
“Within the Crypto Valley and here in Switzerland, there’s a very good collaboration going on, where everyone’s working together to try to design a Swiss franc stablecoin which has more or less the same definition or is fully interoperable,” said Matthew Alexander, SEBA Bank’s head of asset tokenization.

“Coopetition” is an ungainly term at the best of times, while “interoperability” is a word that gets bandied about the blockchain world an awful lot. But it appears that’s what’s happening among Swiss stablecoin issuers.
The end goal, Alexander said, is that “you’ve got something which a consumer, or a central bank or a corporate can trade with anybody else because they know they have the same thing on the other side.”
The Swiss also see the advantage in avoiding the kind of separate andcompeting currency pairsthat have emerged with USD stablecoins liketether(USDT) andUSDC.
Sygnum, which works in partnership with telco giant Swisscom, recently claimed the world’s firste-commerce transactionusing a bank-issued stablecoin, the Sygnum Digital Swiss Franc (DCHF).

“We are absolutely in discussion with other players in the ecosystem,” Martin Burgherr, co-head of clients at Sygnum Bank, said on the topic of stablecoins. “To the clients, it’s a new way to transfer assets via a blockchain and this requires some disruption, and disruption is easier if you not only compete but also team up on certain aspects. We think that there will probably be multiple stablecoins for multiple purposes, but agree that you don’t need 200 stablecoins with a Swiss franc common denominator.”

Bitcoin Suisse is no stranger to crypto interoperability, having led the OpenVASP network to harmonize global anti-money laundering (AML) standards. The firm’s Swiss Crypto Tokens AG subsidiary was the first of the three to come out with a Swiss franc stablecoin, theCryptoFranc (XCHF).
“Within the Swiss crypto industry, we are in frequent discussion with partners and other stablecoin issuers to see what cooperation and new use cases may make sense for the XCHF and how we can further adoption of cryptocurrencies in general,” said Armin Schmid, CEO of Swiss Crypto Tokens.
All three firms praised the support of the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Asked for comment on the growth of stablecoins in Switzerland, a spokesman for SNB referred toa speechby the bank’s chairman, Thomas Jordan.
“We believe that cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-based tokens are of only limited use as payment instruments, stores of value and units of account because they are subject to major fluctuations,” he said last September. “The picture may be different for stable coins, however.”
Diving into the nuts and bolts, there are two levels of stablecoin interoperability, said SEBA’s Alexander. On the one hand, there’s the relatively straightforward technological design of the coins; on the other, the legal and regulatory underpinnings.
Stablecoins, normally built on the Ethereum ERC-20 standard, have an advantage in Switzerland because they tend to be regulated and audited by firms like PwC or Grant Thornton. Starting out with small projects and experiments, an agreed-upon set of rules and auditing capabilities can be defined.

“It literally becomes like an open banking API, and those who prove capable will be allowed to join the network,” said Patrick Salm, SEBA’s head of token platform. “A lack of collaboration will result in five standards and a race for a standard, which is not efficient.”
Standardized common languages are critical. For example, an attempt to implement a stablecoin such astether(USDT) orUSDCwithin a core banking system would not work, simply because such systems are not capable of handling a four-character currency unit, Salm pointed out. Currencies, according to ISO definition, are supposed to be three characters.
“It starts with stuff like this,” said Salm. “We’re not just talking about using a four-digit stablecoin as a settlement coin. … It’s really about the deep roots of banking.”
Naturally, interoperability is front and center when it comes to establishing a euro stablecoin, said Alexander of SEBA.
“We are trying to help design something that is truly interoperable,” Alexander said, adding:
“If lots of European countries are doing their own definition of a euro, you destroy the idea of a European Union when you reach a border and have to exchange your currency in your electronic wallet. You’ve got to have one definition and one means of operating; otherwise, what’s the point of having an integrated European banking system?”

90002,2023-07-25 20:47:17,Elon Musk’s Twitter Overhaul Could Be Huge for DOGE and Crypto Generally,"• Elon Musk’s decision to rename Twitter as X and make it an “everything app” has a shot at broadening use of dogecoin (DOGE), bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.
• “It would be an absolute game-changer to incorporate cryptocurrency payments as part of that ecosystem,” one expert said.
Elon Musk's brazen attempt torefashion Twitter into a new, broader service called Xwill apparently turn the iconic social-media app into a platform for making payments.
This dream, according to experts, probably has implications for cryptocurrencies, most specifically one of the billionaire's favorite playthings: dogecoin (DOGE).
Musk has long talked about creating a so-called everything app that incorporates not only social media and messaging but also the ability to buy things and send money. Crypto could easily factor into that, given Musk’s long history of dabbling in digital assets.
Read more:Dogecoin Bumps 10% on X Payments Speculation, DOGE Futures Traders Lose $10M
His carmaker,Tesla, holds bitcoin. He’s frequently talked about DOGE. “Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool,”he tweeted in 2019. Earlier this year, Twitter’s logo was for several daysswapped out for dogecoin’s dog symbol, driving a huge (albeit temporary) DOGE rally. The tokenjumpedthis week on Monday after Twitter’s X rebranding.
“Elon clearly has an affinity for DOGE, almost as part of a running joke, but I wouldn’t be surprised if he actually went through with enabling payments via DOGE,” said Brian D. Evans, CEO and founder of BDE Ventures, a Web3 venture studio and advisory firm.
In January,the Financial Times reportedthat Musk had asked for payment infrastructure to be built at the company, initially for fiat currencies but with the ability to add crypto later.
Crypto has never broken through to the mainstream, despite flirting with that status amid the bull market that ended in 2021. Musk has many detractors, so enabling payments via crypto on X is not guaranteed to move the needle on crypto adoption. However, X (née Twitter) still has millions of users, so it could broaden use.
“I suspect that he’ll incorporate other crypto assets such as bitcoin, ethereum along with stablecoins like USDC, but DOGE is such a part of Elon’s online presence that he would almost have to include a DOGE function were he to launch a crypto payments system on Twitter,” Evans said.
Musk’s vision for a platform called X goes years back to his time at PayPal, which got its name after the company merged with Peter Thiel and Max Levchin’s company Confitinity. Before the merge, its name wasX.com – a URL Musk now ownsand which redirects totwitter.com.
Twitter has alreadysecured money transmitter licenses, which allows companies to receive and transfer funds, in three U.S. states – Michigan, Missouri and New Hampshire – as it quietly works on its payments tool.
“It’s clear that he’s keenly interested in turning the rebranded Twitter into something of a payments behemoth, and so it’s only natural that he would explore incorporating crypto in this functionality,” said Phillip Shoemaker, executive director ofIdentity.com, a non-profit organization providing decentralized identity verification. “If done correctly, Twitter could become the go-to platform for payments in general, whether they involve normie fintech applications or blockchains like Ethereum and Solana.”
A move into the crypto space wouldn’t be new for the app, which alreadypartnered with Jack Mallers-led payments startup Strikein September 2021 to launch a bitcoin (BTC) tipping feature under former CEO Jack Dorsey.
“If we consider Musk’s vision for creating an everything app, it would be an absolute game-changer to incorporate cryptocurrency payments as part of that ecosystem,” said Raluca Cherciu, the co-founder and CEO of unpaired., an online community exploring how emerging technologies can foster real world connection. “This not only resonates with the hugely active crypto community on Twitter, but also echoes Musk’s well-known fascination with the cryptosphere.”

Samsung, one of the leading tech companies in the world, announced the launch of its virtual store yesterday. The virtual store was opened onDecentraland, one of the leading metaverse projects in the cryptocurrency space.
The company opened a virtual version of its 837 physical store in Decentraland. Samsung’s flagship physical store is located at 837 Washington Street in New York City’s Meatpacking District, Manhattan.
In its announcement, Samsung said,“Join us for CES 2022 to celebrate the opening of Samsung 837X, our official launch in the metaverse. This immersive space lets anyone experience the creative possibilities of 837, Samsung’s culture and technology hub in New York City.”
The company told The Block that the launch of its virtual store is one of the biggest brand land takeovers in the history of Decentraland.
MANA, the native token of the Decentraland platform, is up by more than 14% over the past 24 hours. The news of Samsung opening a virtual store in Decentraland pushed MANA’s price higher in the last few hours. The coin’s technical indicators show that it is currently outperforming numerous other cryptocurrencies.
At press time, MANA is trading at $3.24 per token, which is below its 50-day moving average price of $3.7. However, it could surpass the50-day EMAsoon if the current momentum is maintained.
The MACD line is still below the neutral zone but could enter the positive territory soon. The 14-day RSI of 48 shows that MANA is getting out of the oversold region thanks to its current rally. If the rally continues, MANA could target the $4resistance levelbefore the end of the day.
MANA’s rally comes despite the broader cryptocurrency currently underperforming. The cryptocurrency market has lost more than $200 billion since the start of the week.Bitcoin, the leading crypto, lost its $45k support and is now trading around $42,500 per coin.

There is a significant amount of resistance above, so I do believe that the Euro is going to struggle to continue going higher. It is not to say that we cannot, it is just that there is a lot of noise between here and the 1.12 handle. Speaking of the 1.12 handle, we also have the 50 Day EMA slicing through that level and falling.
That being said, I am looking for signs of exhaustion to get short again, due to the fact that the US dollar is the favored currency when you have a global slowdown, and we most certainly are going through the midst of that right now. I think at this point in time, it is likely that we will continue to see a lot of noisy behavior, but I am not going to be sucked into buying this pair until we get well above the 1.12 handle. It is a matter of volatility and choppy behavior, which typically does not portend strength, and clearly, the European Union has a huge list of problems, not the least of which is a war in Ukraine.
Europe has to worry about energy, and it has to worry about business sentiment which has fallen through the floor. Inflation is an issue, and of course, the interest rate differential between the two economies continues to favor the United States anyway. In other words, it is going to continue to be a market that you wish to short, not by. That being said, I would like to see a little bit of a better price on the US dollar to start shorting.

A bearish start to the day saw bitcoin slide to a low of $17,936 before making a move.
Steering clear of the Major Support Levels, bitcoin rallied to a late high of $20,777.
Bitcoin broke through the First Major Resistance Level at $20,584 before easing back to $20,550 levels.
There were no external market forces to provide bitcoin with direction. Dip-buyers delivered much-needed support, with the US markets closed on Monday.
The pickup in investor appetite came despite risk aversion spreading from the US equity markets. Last week, the NASDAQ fell by 4.78%, with Fed monetary policy and fears of a global recession doing the damage.
While trends were aligned, bitcoin losses had accelerated before Sunday’s relief rally.
Today, the US markets are closed for Juneteenth National Independence Day, leaving the NASDAQ Mini to influence. Later today, investors will need to consider any FOMC member chatter.
Sunday’s relief rally provided modest support to the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index. This morning, the Index climbed from 6/100 to 9/100. Despite the upside, the Index remained deep in the “Extreme Fear” zone.
The weekend fall to 6/100 took the Index below March 2020 levels, when bitcoin stood at sub-$10,000.
Investor sentiment towards Fed monetary policy and investor fears of a global recession remain headwinds near-term.
Barring a marked decline in inflationary pressure, volatility will likely persist as investors digest economic data and central bank forward guidance.
At the time of writing, BTC was down 2.14% to $20,113.
A mixed start to the day saw BTC strike an early high of $20,606 before falling to a low of $20,031.
BTC left the Major Support and Resistance Levels untested early on.
Avoiding the $19,757pivotwould bring the First Major Resistance Level at $21,573 into play.
BTC would need plenty of support for a breakout from Sunday’s high of $20,777.
Another extended rally would test the Second Major Resistance Level at $22,595 and resistance at $23,000. The Third Major Resistance Level sits at $25,437.
A fall through the pivot would bring the First Major Support Level at $18,733 in play. In another extended sell-off, bitcoin could retest support at $17,000. The Second Major Support Level sits at $16,914.
Looking at theEMAsand the 4-hourly candlestick chart (below), it is a bearish signal. Bitcoin sits below the 50-day EMA, currently at $22,094. Today, the 50-day EMA fell back from the 100-day EMA. The 100-day EMA eased back from the 100-day EMA, bitcoin price negative.
A move through the 50-day EMA would give the bulls a look at $25,000.

60649,2022-01-17 21:46:49,Bitcoin: piso de $40.000 no es seguro ante inactividad de institucionales,"Si bien el mercado de opciones de bitcoinha dejado de ser bajista recientemente, algunos analistas siguen sin estar convencidos de la solidez de su tendencia alcista a causa de la débil demanda institucional y la susceptibilidad de la criptomoneda a factores macroeconómicos.
Laurent Kssis, experto en fondos cotizados en bolsa (ETF, por sus siglas en inglés) de criptomonedas y director de CEC Capital, dijo que hay pocas señales de interés renovado por parte de los inversores institucionales, de manera que parece improbable un gran rebote del precio en breve. ""Un buen barómetro es siempre el activo bajo gestión y las entradas en los productos cotizados y ETFs de criptomonedas. Hasta ahora solo hemos recuperado $1000 millones de entradas frente a los $4.000 millones que han salido de estos productos solo en enero"", dijo Kssis a CoinDesk en un chat de Telegram.

El gráfico de arriba, de ByteTree Asset Management, revela que el número de monedas en manos de fondos de inversión cerrados estadounidenses y canadienses, y en manos de ETFs canadienses y europeos, ha disminuido en $377 millones (8812 BTC) desde mediados de diciembre.
Los ingresos en el ETF ProShares Bitcoin Strategy que cotiza en la Bolsa de Nueva York (BITO) se han ralentizado. ""BITO tiene ahora menos de 5.000 contratos de futuros CME por primera vez desde noviembre, y su AUM (NdT: abreviación en inglés para activos bajo gestión) ha alcanzado su nivel más bajo desde el 19 de octubre, lo que indica un interés decreciente por la exposición a BTC a través de ETFs basados en futuros"", dijo Arcane Research en la nota de investigación de la semana pasada, refiriéndose a activos bajo gestión.
El ETF Proshares Bitcoin Strategy, que invierte en futuros de bitcoin listados en la Bolsa Mercantil de Chicago (CME) con el objetivo de imitar el comportamiento del precio de la criptomoneda, es vulnerable a lasangría del contango(NdT: situación en la que el precio spot de un activo es menor a su precio futuro).
Las instituciones y los grandes operadores suelen establecer las tendencias del mercado, mientras que los inversores minoristas son los que siguen la corriente. La negativa de los institucionales a intervenir debería preocupar a los compradores que esperan un repunte desde el reciente nivel de soporte psicológico de $40.000.
El proveedor de servicios cripto Amber Group afirmó que un aumento continuado de los tipos de interés reales o ajustados a la inflación supone el mayor riesgo a la baja para bitcoin y activos de riesgo en general. ""La correlación de bitcoin con el mercado de acciones ha subido"", dijo Amber Group.
Desde mediados de noviembre el rendimiento real a 10 años en los Estados Unidos ha subido 50 puntos básicos hasta -0,66%, de acuerdo a datos del Departamento del Tesoro de ese país. Bitcoin ha bajado casi 40% durante el mismo periodo.
La correlación entre bitcoin y laoferta monetaria M1ha aumentado hasta 0,77, lo que señala una fuerte relación estadística entre los dos, dijo la firma de análisis de blockchain IntoTheBlock en una nota de investigaciónpublicadadurante el fin de semana. Esto implica una perspectiva bajista para bitcoin si la Reserva Federal comienza a elevar los costes de los créditos cada trimestre, como anticipa el mercado de tipos de interés.
Griffin Ardern, un operador especializado en volatilidad y parte de Blofin, una empresa de management de criptoactivos, dijo que a los operadores les convendría apostar por una explosión de volatilidad manteniendo posiciones largas en opciones, en lugar de predecir y apostar hacia dónde podría dirigirse el precio en el futuro.
""Adquirir opciones de compra o de venta, o ambas, son buenas soluciones con algunos costos, ya que la volatilidad implícita es demasiado baja para el lado vendedor, lo que significa una relación riesgo-recompensa inadecuada"", dijo Ardern en un chat de Telegram. Estarlong vegasignifica mantener posiciones en opciones que se beneficiarán de un aumento de la volatilidad.
La volatilidad implícita es la expectativa de los inversores sobre las turbulencias en los precios durante un periodo específico; y tiene un impacto positivo en el precio de una opción. Además, es una métrica que tiende a volver a su valor medio.
Los operadores experimentados suelen adquirir opciones de compra y de venta al mismo tiempo cuando la volatilidad implícita es barata, y vender opciones cuando la métrica es demasiado alta. En las últimas cuatro semanas la volatilidad implícita a un mes se ha desplomado desde un 84% anualizado hasta un 59%, según la fuente de datos Skew. En el momento de escribir este artículo, la métrica se situaba muy por debajo de su media histórica de 76%, por lo que parecía barata según los estándares históricos.
Al cierre de esta edición, bitcoin se negociaba cerca de los $42.150, con pocos cambios en el día. La criptomoneda subió casi 3% en los siete días transcurridos hasta el 16 de enero, defendiendo el nivel de soporte de $40.000 y rompiendo una tendencia perdedora de dos semanas,según data de CoinDesk.
Kssis, de CEC Capital, prevé una nueva prueba de los $40.000 en caso de que bitcoin no logre afianzarse por encima de los $43.000 esta semana y recomienda estrategias de protección ante una posible caída más profunda. Los operadores suelen adquirir opciones de venta o vender futuros como cobertura contra una posición larga en el mercado al contado.
Al cierre de esta edición, el diferencial entre los precios de las opciones de venta —o apuestas bajistas— y los de las opciones de compra —o apuestas alcistas— apenas había variado, lo que implica una tendencia neutral. Los futuros a un mes que cotizan en la Bolsa Mercantil de Chicago (CME) registraron apenas una diferencia con el precio al contado, mientras que los de otras bolsas cotizaban con una prima inferior al 5% anual, muy lejos de las cifras de dos dígitos registradas en octubre y noviembre. Tal vez se deba a que los operadores venden futuros para cubrir su exposición.
Según Pankaj Balani, CEO de Delta Exchange, bitcoin sigue siendo vulnerable a una caída más profunda debido a la falta de demanda de compra. ""No estamos viendo ninguna pesca de fondo en estos niveles, y el interés por poseer el riesgo de bitcoin en torno a $40.000 sigue siendo bajo"", dijo Balani a CoinDesk en un chat de WhatsApp. ""Podríamos volver a probar los $40.000; y, en caso de que eso se rompa, podemos ver una nueva ronda de ventas"".",41663.24,0.06,41676.52,0.09,41624.79,-0.03,42192.45,1.33,41638.54
21652,2020-03-09 08:18:11,Boeing 737 Max Electrical Wiring Issues Further Delay Return To Sky,"Boeing Co.(NYSE:BA) must fixelectrical wiring issuesinside its grounded 737 MAX planes before they are cleared to fly by the FAA.
What Happened
In another setback for Boeing, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) concluded that the wiring layout of the 737 Max violates wiring-safety standards aimed at preventing short-circuits, according to The Wall Street Journal.
The aviation regulator decided that “under extreme circumstances,” the failure of the wiring could lead the 737 MAX flight control systems to point the plane’s nose sharply downwards in the same manner as the two MAX Jets that crashed in the past and killed 346 people.
Official confirmation has not been made by FAA Administrator Steve Dickson, but the regulator’s safety and certification officials have been told by technical experts at the FAA that changes are required in the wiring locations.
Why It Matters
In late February, Boeing haddiscoveredforeign object debris in some of the grounded MAX’s fuel tanks.
Wiring changes could delay 737 MAX’s returns to the skies by several weeks reported the Journal citing sources. Boeing had planned to return the 737 Max back to service by mid-June.
This is a test of new Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun’s ability to steer the company out of the crisis caused by the fatal crashes that led to the grounding of these aircraft. Calhoun has taken a more conciliatory stand with respect to the FAA.
What Else Is There
In a boost for Boeing last month, Japanese airline group ANA Holdings Inc.announcedthe purchase of 20 additional 787 Dreamliners valued at more than $5 billion at list prices.
Price Action
Boeing shares traded 1.27% lower at $259 in the after-hours session on Friday. The shares had closed the regular session 0.75% higher at $262.33.

Rogan praised Musk, whom he oncedescribed as his ""favorite billionaire,"" for taking on powerful entities and questioned why anyone would think someone as wealthy as Musk, with a net worth of around $400 billion, would need to steal from taxpayers.

• If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
Rogan argued that Musk, being one of the smartest minds alive, is simply fighting back after being messed with by government agencies and critics. ""I’m telling you, that’s not what he’s doing. What he’s doing is he’s a super genius that’s been f****d with,  and when you’ve been f****d with by these nitwits that hide behind three-letter agencies, and you’re dealing with one of the smartest people alive and hehelpsDonald Trumpget in officeand he goes ‘I want to find out what kind of corruption is really around,’ well you f****d up you f****d up and picked the wrong psychopath on the spectrum because he’s gonna hunt you down. And that’s good,"" Rogan explained.
He highlighted Musk's involvement in uncovering supposed wasteful government spending and praised his ability to bring in ""a bunch of psychopath wizards"" tohelp with his mission. However, the idea that Musk isn't interested in making more money seems questionable at best. Billionaires don't typically build empires by walking away from profit opportunities. According to a recent report from Informa Connect Academy, Musk is on track to become the world's first trillionaire by 2027.
Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing —you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.
While Rogan believes Musk’s actions are for the greater good, it’s worth considering that many of Musk’s moves,from Tesla(NASDAQ:TSLA) toSpaceXand nowreviewing government spendingwhile holding numerouslucrative government projects, often align with his business interests, raising questions about his motivations.
For instance,Musk met with Indian Prime MinisterNarendra Modion Thursday. President Trump couldn’t explain to reporters whether he was meeting with Modi as a CEO or as a representative of the US government. “I don’t know, they met, and I assume hewants to do business in India, but India is a very hard place to do business in,”Trump said.
This podcast episode also touched on political corruption, with Rogan questioning howpoliticians amass millionson modest salaries and expressing distrust in Bitcoin due to potential hacking threats from quantum computing. But the standout moment remains Rogan's defense of Musk, despite the clear contradiction that billionaires, no matter how brilliant, are rarely motivated by pure altruism. So, did Rogan miss the mark here?

50685,2021-05-10 12:25:00,Release Content Introduces Ways to Begin a Crypto Centered Business in 2021,"FORT KENT, Maine, May 10, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Recently, Release Content launches its new services of educational contents. Since the development of Blockchain technology, the cryptocurrency industry has experienced greater heights. While Bitcoin remains the most popular coin, there are over a hundred cryptocurrencies that most people don't remember. Interestingly, that area is one that any intelligent business-inclined person can take advantage of. And this is where Release content brings some Ways To Begin A Crypto Centered Business In 2021.
The cryptocurrency industry is still in its infancy stage, where people need information. You can start a business in this area. Immerse yourself into the business specifications, research more about the industry, have discussions with experts, and enhance the opportunity to succeed.
Nevertheless, it will never be a bumper-free ride because starting a business is always challenging and requires a lot of hard work, commitment, and persistence to progress. Notwithstanding anything, you can create a lucrative business in the cryptocurrency industry and become very influential.
Introducing New Ways to Begin in Crypto Industry
When starting a cryptocurrency business, before thinking of incorporation services, you need to develop a strategy. That will give you an edge over other companies once you start. To help you get that edge, here are a few steps to starting your business and when to employ a business formation services company. Without further ado, let's begin.
1. Everything starts with Planning
Without a concrete plan, you are already on the path to failure. With a well-defined, transparent, and detailed plan, you can know your roadmap and determine your success. A plan will allow you to define the goal and objective of the company and what strategy to employ at each stage. Remember, even with your plans, you can face challenges and problems.
It is never enough to buy a ready-made plan because you have to put certain things into consideration. You need to define your target audience, cost, and potentials of your investors. Furthermore, you need to determine if your business can be profitable. Some of these questions will enable you to determine if you can move forward or not.
2. Form A Legal Entity
Your business needs an entity, and the best way to do that is to form a business structure. There are various business structures to choose from as you start. You have the option of a sole proprietorship, limited liability company (LLC), partnership, and corporation. The reason to set your business as a legal one is that it protects you from being held personally if someone sues your business.
Today, several incorporation services providers can help you if you don't want to pay the LLC costs. Alternatively, you can hire thebest LLC servicesprovider for a small fee to ensure you get everything sorted out. Furthermore, you need to apply for state and federal taxes before opening your business. To register for taxes for your company, you need to apply for an EIN, which is usually free.
There are many LLC services companies to choose from when starting a new cryptocurrency business in 2021. These online business formation services can help you streamline the process and identify what each state requires. While ZenBusiness seems to be the favorite, LegalZoom is another option to consider. Furthermore, other LegalZoom alternatives include Northwest Registered Agent, Incfile, BetterLegal, and Inc Authority.
3. Receive Licenses and Permits
If you eventually made it through the two steps above, you are close to setting up your cryptocurrency business. The next step is getting the necessary permits and license to make your company legal.
4. Get Business Insurance
In as much as licenses and permits are essential, your business needs insurance. You need to protect it to operate lawfully and safely. The essence of business insurance is to protect your company's financial wellbeing peradventure something unexpected happens.
Nowadays, we have different types of insurance policies to handle different risks. For beginners, you can start with General Liability Insurance as it covers everything a small business needs. You can also get workers' compensation insurance if you have workers under you.
5. Create a business Identity
Once you have completed every legal and insurance policy, you need to give an identity to your cryptocurrency business. Here, you create a unique brand name and build social media account for marketing purposes. Today, social media platforms play an integral role in building and growing a brand.

5205,2017-10-11 16:00:48,Nearing Bottom? Litecoin Prices Consolidating After Rough September,"Litecoin's price has had a hard time in the fallout of China's initial coin offering (ICO) ban.
While both bitcoin and litecoin took a hit after the early Septemberstatement from Chinese regulators– followed by domestic cryptocurrency exchanges voluntarily ceasing to offer services in the aftermath – bitcoin quickly recovered andneared record highsagainst the US dollar this week.
As litecoin support struggled, bitcoin seems to have benefitted from the rotation out of ether andethereum-based tokens, triggered by fears of China-like ICO restrictions in other jurisdictions.
Against the U.S. dollar, litecoin is now down by more than $40 from its record high of $98.28, achieved on September 1. Further, the litecoin-bitcoin (LTC/BTC) exchange rate fell from 0.019 BTC (September 2 high) to 0.0098 BTC this week.
At press time, LTC/BTC is trading at 0.0105 BTC – down 0.9 percent on the day. Week-over-week, the pair is down 13.22 percent, while on a monthly basis, it is nursing a 34 percent loss.
However, price action analysis suggests that the LTC/BTC pair could be nearing a bottom.
The 4-hour chart shows that:
• The relative strength index (RSI) is rising from the oversold region.
• The falling trend line is seen offering resistance at 0.0115 BTC.
The weekly chart shows that:
• Prices are currently hovering around the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of 0.01025 BTC, which acted as a strong support mechanism in May, June and August.
• Trading volumes have dropped significantly during the recent sell-off.
• The upward sloping 50-day moving average is seen offering support at 0.0098 BTC.
• The oversold conditions on the daily and 4-hour chart – which come at a time when prices are hovering around the critical 61.8% Fibonacci retracement support level – indicates the LTC/BTC pair could be nearing a bottom.
• The dips below 0.01025 BTC (61.8% Fibonacci retracement) are likely to be short-lived.
• The pair is more likely to rally to 0.012 and 0.0135 (200-day moving average) levels in the short run.

Fears eased somewhat after New York Fed President John Williams described the economy as headed ""in the right direction."" According to theCME FedWatchTool, 43.5% of investors are expecting an interest rate hike in November.
Among individual names,Applewas especially notable this week, as China's iPhone ban for governmental officials sparked fear among shareholders of further restrictions. The tech giant's shares slid 5.1% this week.

73842,2023-05-31 12:30:00,Crypto Wire-Temasek’s FTX reckoning,"May 31 - Plus, what Ron DeSantis thinks about bitcoin. When a crypto exchange valued at $32 billion collapses, the investors who put money into it are left in an uncomfortable position. This week, Singapore's Temasek finished a six-month review into what went wrong. Meanwhile, regulators around the world are still looking to rein in the risks in the crypto space.

Temasek’s FTX reckoning
Temasek, Singapore’s state investor, was one of the biggest names to have invested in FTX before it collapsed. It put in around $275 million, which it then wrote down to zero. Temasek said it had done “extensive due diligence” on FTX and seen an audited financial statement that showed it to be profitable.
Now, after a six-month internal review of what went wrong, the investor said on Monday it reduced the pay of the team who recommended investing in FTX, and for senior management, as part of a move to take “collective accountability” for the investment. Temasek’s chairman said there had been no misconduct by the investment team, but acknowledged the “negative impact” on Temasek’s reputation. Meanwhile, U.S. presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis spoke in favour of allowing individuals to invest in cryptocurrencies, arguing that the incumbents in Washington “have it out for Bitcoin”.
Here’s exactly what he said: ""You have every right to do Bitcoin. The only reason these people in Washington don't like it is because they don't control it. And they're central planners, and they want to have control over society. And so Bitcoin represents a threat to them... I just do not have an itch to have to control everything that people may be doing in this space.

72471,2022-12-09 11:30:00,Bitcoin miners took on billions in debt to ‘pump their stock’—leading to a crypto catastrophe,"The phone just won’t stop ringing, beams Zach Bradford, the CEO of Bitcoin mining company CleanSpark. The calls are from other mining bosses—and they’re panicking. After Bitcoin crashed and energy costs spiraled over the summer, mining firms that took out expensive short-term loans to buy hardware during the bull run now teeter on bankruptcy. Lenders are breathing down their necks, and the miners need quick cash. But only a handful of companies are buying mining rigs these days—and Bradford’s CleanSpark, which only took on a small amount of debt during the bull run, is one of them.
Having always sold 70% of the Bitcoin it mined using mostly cheapnuclear energy, CleanSpark is in the enviable position of being rich enough to swoop in to buy box-fresh, top-of-the-line machines from near-bankrupt miners at sensible prices. At the start of the month, CleanSpark spent $5.9 million on 3,843 miners that Bradford says cost about $1,500 each—down from $13,000 last November during peak Bitcoin mania. Crypto finance giant Grayscale also had hopes of buying miners on the cheap but then pulled back amid economic troubles at its parent company, while Bitdeer set upa $250 million fundto exploit the crisis.
Meanwhile, the pressure has only continued to build at companies that bungled the Bitcoin crash. Core Scientific, America’s largest Bitcoin miner, took on a debt-to-equity ratio almost 12 times greater than CleanSpark during the bull run and now risks bankruptcy if it doesn't raise money by the end of the year, havinglost $1.7 billion in 2022 alone. Another miner, Argo, told investors it’ll shut down if it can’t sell miners it hasn’t even taken out of the box. Another, Iris,defaulted on a $108 million loan.
And there is the state of Texas, whose bold experiment to welcome Bitcoin miners to help balance the power grid risks turned into a Lone Star State-sized disaster. In the wake of rising energy prices and debt burdens among miners, one state executivebemoaneda situation where “transformers, switch gears, and mobile data centers and containers for mining...are just sitting there.”
So how exactly did this mess develop? One would expect that miners, who had to wait months for out-of-stock rigs to arrive, would have played it safe in a market known for volatility. But Guzman Pintos, the cofounder of mining company Luxor, says that these mining companies were incentivized to load up with debt to “pump their stock.” The premise is simple enough: The more mining rigs a company operates, the more Bitcoin they can produce, the greater its revenue, the higher its stock’s value—so long as Bitcoin’s price continues to fly.
During the bull run, publicly traded Core Scientific increased mining income by 3,440% to $210.8 million, having raised its Bitcoin mining power by 4.5 times to 13.5 EH/s at the end of 2021 (EH/s is a measure of “hash rate” or deployed computing power). Bitcoin miner Hut8 added 9,592 machines in the first quarter of this year, increasing its capacity by nearly a third. The sudden increase in capacity “was insane, it was ridiculous—but that was what public markets were paying for,” says Pintos.
Miners used their debt to stretch their money even further, holding onto Bitcoin they produced and speculating on its worth. To cover their spiraling costs, Pintos says some miners collected premiums on futures contracts. He says industry financiers were practically “giving money away,” relaxing the amount of collateral requireded for loans and even accepting deposits of Bitcoin while the cryptocurrency’s price continued to soar.
And then the party came to an abrupt end. For the riskier miners, things took a turn for the worse when energy prices rose over the summer and Bitcoin crashed. “Nobody was expecting both,” says Pintos. Electricity costs for Argo’s Texas operation were almostthree times the average prices for August, owing to an overwhelmed grid and an energy agreement that priced electricity at market rates.
Pintos estimates margins dropped from 70% to 20%—not nearly enough to pay for energy costs and repay loans. “The financial return on investment became almost impossible for miners,” says Dan Ives, a managing director of Wedbush Securities. ”It's been a near-term gut punch to the industry—no different than the burst of the dot-com bubble.”
Indebted miners are now in a tight spot. For those who held Bitcoin mined during the bull run, selling it now will fetch a quarter of its all-time high, while mining rigs, whose prices strongly correlate with Bitcoin’s own price, have collapsed in value. Pintos says secondary sales of unused individual miners are cheaper than the listing price of their wholesale manufacturers—and they even come with the same warranty. Stock prices of all mining companies have almost universally plummeted as soaring operating costs squeeze the pulp from their margins.
Lenders now hold all the power. Financiers have already begun to repossess mining equipment—lender NYDIG took back 26,200 machines from miner Stronghold. Generate Capital hasboughta $5 million stake in its bankrupt debtor, mining firm Compute North. [hotlink ignore=true]Compass Point, an investment company, wrote in an investment note that lenders should lower the monthly payments they extract from miners to stop them from returning rigs and using the money to buy new computers at a lower price.
Still, Pintos says the worst is over. As miners unplug, the Bitcoin blockchain will make it easier to mine new coins, thereby increasing the revenue of the miners who survive. But if Bitcoin’s price rises, the cycle of short-term loans and cascading crashes may continue once more. CleanSpark's Bradford thinks that none of the current roster of lenders would issue longer-term debt—with repayment terms of at least three years, and ideally five to seven—that could prevent another liquidity crisis. But it’ll be years until that happens, he says. After the collapse of FTX shakes the industry to its core, it’ll take a long time until institutional lenders trust crypto again.

• The Differences: Litecoin Cash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin
Litecoin went through a hard fork at block 1371111 on Sunday evening, resulting in the creation of Litecoin Cash (“LCC”).
There was plenty of noise in the lead up to the fork, with Litecoin founder Charlie Lee and others from the Litecoin community calling the announcement of the fork a scam.
Regardless, Litecoin rallied 60% to a week high $237.72 on Thursday, as investors moved into Litecoin in anticipation of receiving 10 Litecoin Cash coins for each Litecoin held in a Litecoin wallet at the time of the fork.
Now that Litecoin Cash does in fact exist and is already tradable, there are some distinct differences between Litecoin and Litecoin Cash, with theLitecoin Cash teamlooking to deliver a cryptocurrency that is miner-friendly, whilst tweaking some other key attributes.
Key characteristics of Litecoin Cash include:
• Litecoin Cash will be run with Bitcoin’s SHA256 algorithm as opposed to Litecoin’s Scrypt algo.
The use of Bitcoin’s SHA256 algo provides prospective miners to mine for Litecoin Cash, with the SHA256 proof-of-work algorithm allowing Litecoin Cash mining using old and obsolete Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (“ASICs”) Bitcoin mining hardware.
• The total supply of Litecoin Cash is 840 million LCC coins, far greater than Litecoin’s 84 million coins.
• Litecoin Cash has a different difficulty adjustment to Litecoin, with Litecoin Cash seeing the mining difficulty adjusted with every block, using Evan Duffield’s DarkGravity V3 algorithm from Dash, compared with Litecoin’s approximately 3.5 days.
• Litecoin Cash transaction fees are reported to be 90% cheaper than Litecoin’s fees.
The use of the DarkGravity V3 algorithm provides a more predictable block time environment, supporting a target block time of 2.5 minutes, resulting in the lower transaction fees.
The Litecoin Cash team’s objective is to deliver a cheap and fast SHA256 coin that has a favorable difficulty adjustment.
The first step in buying Litecoin Cash is to set up a Litecoin Cash wallet that can store your Litecoin Cash (“LCC”) coins following the purchase. The same wallet will also be used when wanting to sell LCC coins, with the coins transferable to an exchange that accepts Litecoin Cash for sale, or to a merchant in the case of a purchase.
On theLitecoin Cash website, a number of wallets have been recommended by the team to cater for Windows, MAC OSX, Linux, and mobiles.
As it is always recommended to store coins in a wallet supported by the team behind the coin, we propose that one of the wallets recommended by the Litecoin Cash team be downloaded to store the Litecoin Cash coins.
Once the wallet has been downloaded to your desktop, run the executable and follow the instructions in order to set up the wallet on your desktop.
At this point, you will need to go to File>>Import Private Key, with the private key entered needing to be backed up somewhere safe to avoid loss of the coins held within the wallet. The wallet will also need to be encrypted for added security before being backed up, though do note that the Litecoin Cash blockchain will need to be downloaded and synchronized before this step.
The Litecoin Cash website contains a “Bootstrap” download. This is an optional file that is there to synchronize your blockchain faster when you initially install Litecoin Cash.
Once synchronized, the wallet will no longer be “behind”, as it was upon download. At this point, you will need to obtain the Receive Address, by selecting the Receive tab and copy the address somewhere safe so that the LCC coins can be transferred to the wallet upon purchase. It is recommended that a new address is generated on each occasion.
Now, click on settings>>Encrypt Wallet and create a secure password that must be at least ten or more random characters, or eight or more words. It is recommended to use at least 16 characters that include letters, numbers and punctuation marks.
Upon completion, an icon on the bottom right-hand corner of the wallet will indicate that the wallet has been encrypted and locked. The password will need to be stored in a safe place as this will be needed each time you want to access the wallet and will result in losing the coins in the event of loss of the password.
With the wallet now created, LCC coins can be bought with, either U.S Dollar or Russian Roubles, or they can be purchased with one of 3 cryptocurrencies, these being Bitcoin DOGE and Ethereum.
At present, Litecoin Cash can only be bought and sold onYObit, which caters for purchasing Litecoin Cash with the pairings LCC/USD and LCC/RUR for those interested in purchasing with fiat currencies.
While it is possible to currently purchase with fiat currency, a common way to purchase Litecoin Cash will also be with one of the three crypto pairings offered byYObit.
Below is a Step-by-Step guide to buying Litecoin Cash (“LCC”) with other cryptocurrencies:
1. Open an account – In the event that you don’t already have an account on an exchange and are not holding Bitcoin, DOGE or Ethereum, open an account atCoinbase, and purchase Bitcoin, DOGE or Ethereum. It’s worth noting that, while there are higher transaction fees when purchasing with debit or credit card, the purchase is immediate.
2. Sign into Yobit – Once you have bought BTC, DOGE or ETH, sign intoYObitand open an account.
(Remember to always use strong passwords and to also enable the 2FA option when prompted).
1. Transfer your BTC, DOGE or ETH coins fromCoinbaseinto your newly openedYObitIn order to do that, click the “Funds” tab and search for BTC or DOGE or ETH, depending on the cryptocurrency you bought, choose “Deposit”, copy the deposit address and paste it to the exchange that you intend to withdraw the cryptocurrency from, by selecting send. This process can take up to an hour, depending on backlogs.
2. Return to theYObittrading platform, search for the pairing, whether it’s LCC/BTC, LCC/DOGE or LCC/ETH and proceed with the transaction. Upon completion of the transaction, you will find the newly purchased LCC coins in the Deposits ‘Withdrawals’ tab located in the ‘Funds’ section of your account. We would highly recommend transferring the coins into the recently downloaded Litecoin Cash wallet and to not leave them on the exchange. Select ‘Withdrawal’, enter the details and select submit. You had previously saved your Litecoin Cash wallet address safely when setting up the wallet. The LCC coins will then transfer from yourCoinbaseaccount to your Litecoin Cash wallet and will remain there until you wish to sell them
Digital wallets are virtual wallets that allow coin holders to hold their cryptocurrencies privately as opposed to on the exchange from where they were purchased. The wallet allows coin holders to send and receive cryptocurrencies from the wallet to an exchange or merchant.
It is always advisable for coin holders to store their coins in a private wallet and not on an exchange, with many cases of coin theft having been reported from exchanges in recent times.
In the case of Litecoin Cash, the website recommendsCoinomifor mobiles, which is a free secure source-available multi-coin multi-asset HD wallet for Bitcoin altcoins and tokens.
For Windows, the team recommends QT Wallet for Windows and MAC OSX and QT & headless Linux Binaries for Linux, the wallets are available for download from theLitecoin Cash website.
It is always recommended that a wallet is used that has been endorsed by the company or team behind the cryptocurrency, whilst also ensuring that the wallet has private keys and encryption of the private keys.
Wallets and private keys should always be backed up in order to avoid the loss of coins held within a wallet, as the loss of either the wallet or the private keys will result in the loss of coins held.
At present, Litecoin Cash has only been made available onYObitaccording toCoincodex, though there have been reports that exchangesTradeSatoshi,MEANXTRADE,MercatoxandCryptoBridgeare also scheduled to list Litecoin Cash following Sunday’s fork.
As demand builds, we will expect other exchanges to begin including Litecoin Cash, with exchanges having a tendency to hold back immediately after a fork to assess the performance and demand for a resultant cryptocurrency.
As we have seen withBitcoin Cashand other fork cryptocurrencies, any time lapse from creation to inclusion is not reflective of general sentiment towards the cryptocurrency, with some of the major cryptocurrencies yet to have been included on larger exchanges.
Unlikely previous forks, Litecoin Cash became tradable almost immediately, with cryptocurrency exchangeYObitmaking Litecoin Cash available for trade, removing the need for a futures or synthetic price. Litecoin Cash surged to a first hour high $8.00 before sliding to a low to $0.63 in the hour after launch. Since then, Litecoin Cash has found its legs and sits at $7.52 at the time of writing, a since launch gain of 437% (Launch Price Estimate: $1.40), whilst having hit a 24-hour high $9.99.
Investors who bought low and sold high would have made quite a tidy sum.
We have seen other cryptocurrency launches lead to sizeable rallies in the early days and the moves over the last 24-hours will certainly be called speculative in nature by some of the skeptics.
For those originally holding Litecoin and receiving the 10 Litecoin Cash coins for each Litecoin held, there won’t be any complaints and for miners with obsolete ASICs hardware sitting around, the surge in price is certainly an incentive to support the network.
Litecoin Cash and Bitcoin are perhaps to be considered more comparable than Litecoin and Bitcoin by the fact that both cryptocurrencies are on a SHA256 proof-of-work algorithm that allows the cryptomarket to make a more direct comparison from a performance and cost perspective.
It’s no crypto secret that Bitcoin has its troubles, with transaction speeds of 10-minutes and extortionate fees. Litecoin Cash has taken some elements of Bitcoin and some elements of Litecoin and delivered a hybrid, whilst also looking to drive support for the transaction speeds by making Litecoin Cash mining more accessible.
Other differences to Bitcoin include the maximum supply, with Bitcoin having just 21 million coins and a difficulty adjustment of 2-weeks, compared with each block for Litecoin Cash and the 840 million LLC coins.
While we have looked at the key differences between Litecoin and Litecoin Cash, it’s also important to note that the Litecoin Cash team have no affiliation with Litecoin, something that Litecoin founder Charlie Lee was quick to point out last week and the Litecoin Cash team have also highlight on theirwebsite.
In the creation of Litecoin, the team focused on transaction fees and speed, when switching from Bitcoin’s SHA256 algorithm to Scrypt. While there were certain improvements, the shift to Scrypt left older mining machines obsolete. While the algorithms differ, the blockchain size of approximately 13Gb is the same, both of which are far smaller than those of Bitcoin and Bitcoin’s 145Gb.
The nuances between the various cryptocurrencies and those that result from hard forks are all in an effort to become the leading crypto in the market. To-date, Bitcoin continues to sit at top of the tree, with various hybrids and enhancements having yet to test Bitcoin. We will expect the day to come, however, when Bitcoin’s mantle as the #1 coin is tested and it may well come from a fork that delivers a hybrid too good to be ignored.

77350,2022-02-01 13:30:00,SurgePays Issues Summary Shareholder Letter,"- Providing Preliminary 2021 Financial Results and Initial Outlook for 2022 -
BARTLETT, Tenn., Feb. 01, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SurgePays,Inc. (Nasdaq: SURG) (“SurgePays” or the “Company”),a fintech company providing essential financial services and prepaid products to the underbanked and underserved, today issued a letter to shareholders from its Chairman & CEO, Brian Cox, summarizing key SurgePays developments in 2021 and providing strategic plans and initial expectations for 2022.
Dear Valued Shareholders:
2021 was a transformative year of results and accomplishments for the SurgePays team. Our key objectives, including access to capital, liquidity and long-term shareholder value, hinged on achieving a listing on the NASDAQ exchange. This was without question the most important accomplishment since starting this public company journey almost 4 years ago. Regardless of pandemics or other curveballs, our team persevered through every obstacle to succeed in this monumental accomplishment.
There were several other notable achievements and moves made during 2021 that I would like to highlight. While our sales in previous years had steadily increased, our profitability was not improving. Our executive team set out to refocus inward to explore margin expansion and pursue strategies to be more financially efficient while building the foundation for rapid sales increases. We strive to reach $1 billion in annual sales, but on a more profitable trajectory so we do not have to dilute our shareholders by raising capital. I don’t want to sell investors on valuations of future breakeven based on hope. I prefer to discuss our ability to grow rapidly organically and through accretive acquisitions while simultaneously making money across our core revenue channels. While our top line sales for 2021 did not increase at the same growth rate as previous years, our executive team did an outstanding job of reducing our monthly burn and cut our yearly operating loss by almost 50% compared to our 2020 numbers while still achieving similar top line sales numbers. These numbers improved month over month and trended towards operational positive cash flow.
Also in 2021, we enhanced our ability to provide mobile internet directly to underbanked and underserved consumers by launching our SurgePhone Mobile Broadband subsidiary. Starting with zero customers in August, we reached over 30,000 subscribers by end of year. Our growth trajectory continues and we have already achieved the milestone of over 1,000 activations in a single day. We are deploying sales teams in over 12 states in an effort to reach my target of 200,000 mobile broadband subscriber activations by the end of 2022 with monthly recurring revenue of $30 per subscriber.
SurgePays is a fintech company focused on underbanked and underserved communities. We utilize a suite of financial and prepaid products to convert corner stores into tech-hubs for underbanked neighborhoods. The neighborhood stores are profit partners that provide a multichannel distribution network for SurgePays to deliver consumer products, allow cash-to-digital currency conversions as well as capture data and build a loyal consumer base. These communities historically have been overlooked by larger corporations, but we saw the opportunity in this largely untapped market years ago and feel we have developed a competitive advantage as a sector leader by procuring a suite of all-encompassing underbanked financial and prepaid products.
We believe the infrastructure we have built positions us at a grassroots level, allowing us to serve this underbanked market better than any company in the sector. We are looking to corner the underbanked market both in the consumer’s home through our direct-to-consumer model and where these consumers shop in the neighborhood community markets. As we have enhanced our offering to now include a comprehensive suite of value-driven financial service products for the underbanked, our ability to add stores and grow market share has significantly increased.
In seeing the addressable opportunity and understanding our focus on neighborhood community markets, consider:
• Residents of low-income neighborhoods visit c-stores five or more times per week due to proximity, convenience, and a lack of other stores in the neighborhood.
• The underbanked generally rely on local retailers to fill the financial services gap that leaves many families operating on a cash basis.
• There are over 74,000,000 prepaid wireless subscribers in the U.S. with most paying for service (top-up) in person.
• Many c-store distributors have been doing business the same way for over 100 years and additionally do not serve Hispanic stores which means the market is primed for disruption.
• The Hispanic population has increased to more than 63.6 million representing over $2 trillion in consumer spending power.
Many shareholders have asked about the future of our LogicsIQ subsidiary. We have decided that it’s in the best interest for both the company and shareholders to pursue a strategic path to spin the subsidiary off. We have our legal, consulting and banking team working diligently on the best way to maximize this transaction. I need to be able to give a focused and concise vision and mission for SurgePays. The spin-off of Logics will enable me to more clearly and quickly explain our company, our products and services and goals.
2021 Preliminary Results
For the full year 2021, we expect to report revenues between $51 - $55 million and with our loss from operations cut almost in half compared to 2020.
As part of our strategy to improve the foundation of the company, we conducted a thorough review of our infrastructure, software duplicity and excess, products and customer base. We focused on profitable products and customers while eliminating unprofitable components of our business. Also, we transitioned from our software development phase, substantially reducing monthly spend.
2022 Outlook
With the company’s foundation solidified, the balance sheet improved and the product offering growing, we anticipate a return to revenue growth in 2022. Specific goals include:
• As I mentioned earlier, we have a goal of 200,000 mobile broadband subscriber activations by the end of the year. We believe we can generate revenue of at least $75 million in 2022. This is only for Mobile Broadband Subscribers recurring monthly revenue– a channel that only started in August of 2021.
• We expect SurgePays consolidated to hit $130 million in annualized revenues by Q4 in 2022.
• SurgePhone is currently approved to offer customers discounted Mobile Broadband services in California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Texas. We believe we will be offering service in over 40 states by April 2022 thus enabling us to calibrate sales upward with an essentially unlimited geographic landscape for sales.
• We expect to grow the network of stores transacting on our SurgePays fintech platform organically and through additional acquisitions. The immediate focus is building the national sales team. The significant profit catalyst coming from the mobile broadband revenue has given us the luxury of calibrating our focus to ramping up store acquisitions 3 times as fast as originally planned. If we were burning capital, the focus would be more methodical, cautious and exploring ways to bring on stores one market at a time. Now, we can bring on stores rapidly with our key objective simply being adding stores daily. One of our key business metrics and overall valuation targets will specifically be how many independently owned stores are transacting on our network. We will initially focus on 3 to 4 markets by the 2nd quarter, to further refine the onboarding process and then expand nationally in 3rdquarter. Our goal is to grow the network to over 20,000 stores by year end.
• Our ability to sell Bitcoin for cash, at the community store level, should start gaining traction and market acceptance as we believe we will be on the forefront of digital currently adoption by the underbanked. This is especially true in the immigrant market once consumers realize they can avoid the 15%-18% fees they are paying remittance companies simply to send cash back home to Central and South America. These consumers will be able to keep more of their own money simply by purchasing Bitcoin and sending Bitcoin to their relatives which is being made easier by Central and South American countries adopting Bitcoin and setting up fee free ATMS around their countries. Additionally, some countries such as El Salvador are even sponsoring digital wallets and creating awareness for their citizens. With remittances such a huge portion of these countries GDP, it only makes sense that these countries would attempt to reduce the remittance fees the family members of residents are paying and increase the cash going directly into their local economies. SurgePays is positioned to be the company at the grass roots store level in the U.S. enabling this disruptive transition.
We are not surprised at the success behind us and the opportunities in front of us. Our team has worked tirelessly building a foundation for this type of growth. We all realize there is a gold rush mixed with a land rush as it pertains to the last digital frontier in America: the underbanked. Our SurgePays FinTech software enables community stores to become the financial tech-hubs for underbanked and underserved neighborhoods and now our mobile broadband devices provide essential internet access in the homes of our target customers. We believe we are cornering the underbanked market both at home and where these consumers shop.
We believe the infrastructure we have built positions us to serve the underbanked market at a grassroots level better than any company in the sector. We couldn’t be more excited about the opportunities ahead and we look forward to sharing our progress with our shareholders, employees and partners. I greatly appreciate your support and interest.
Thank you,
Brian Cox

A document was uploaded yesterday to Kremlin.ru containing a list of instructions from President Putin regarding the implementation of the Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly. One particular instruction under the name “Pr-294, p. 3a-2” relates to “federal laws aimed at the development of digital economy, including determining the procedure for conducting civil law transactions in electronic form, as well as regulating digital financial assets and attracting financial resources using digital technologies.” It is noted that prominent Russian politicians Volodin Vyacheslav Viktorovich and Medvedev Dmitry Anatolyevich will be responsible for carrying out the instruction. The period for execution is set for July 1st, 2019. Blockchain development on the rise Russian financial outlet Rambler recently reported that the State Duma – the lower house of the Federal Assembly of Russia – plans to review and adopt a law relating to cryptocurrency in March this year. With its adoption, the Russian Federation aims to accelerate the development of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies to aid businesses. Reportedly, Oleg Nikolaev, who is a member of the State Duma Committee on Economic Policy, has stated the situation is in the final stages of development. Coin Rivet has also reported on a claim made by Russian university professor Vladislav Ginko that he expects Russia to invest “at least $10 billion” in crypto this year. According to reports, Russia’s plans to introduce a “ CryptoRuble ” to rival Bitcoin are also in full swing. Interested in reading more crypto and blockchain-related news from Russia?

Each bet comprises a ""Yes"" and a ""No"" side. Each share pays out $1 in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency that trades at par with the U.S. dollar, if the prediction comes true, and zero if not.
In October, a <a href=""https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/10/24/microsoft-urges-shareholders-to-vote-against-a-proposal-to-assess-bitcoin-as-a-diversification-investment-filing"" target=""_blank"">proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research</a> urged Microsoft to add bitcoin to its balance sheet as a diversification investment, but the board recommended shareholders vote against it, arguing that crypto lacked the stability to be part of the treasury of a company the size of MSFT.
Saylor, the executive chairman of Microstrategy (MSTR), which has seen its stock rocket up 455% year-to-date, <a href=""https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/02/micro-strategy-added-15-4-k-bitcoin-for-1-5-b-taking-total-holdings-to-402-100-tokens"" target=""_blank"">recently pitched</a> Microsoft's board on this issue, arguing bitcoin could act as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, potentially boosting Microsoft’s $3.2 trillion market cap to over $8 trillion.
Microsoft's current treasury strategy, Saylor says, is weakening the company, as it has ""surrendered"" $200 billion in capital over five years through dividends and buybacks, which he argued could have been invested in Bitcoin, now up over 1,200% in that period.
One Polymarket bettor argued that there wasn't really a point for institutional investors to want Microsoft to add bitcoin to its balance sheet, because there are already so many options out there to get bitcoin exposure – which wasn't the case when Microstrategy originally bought.
""They're just making their value assessment more difficult by muddying up safe investments (MFST) with volatile ones (BTC),"" <a href=""https://polymarket.com/profile/0x79add3f87e377b0899b935472c07d2c3816ba9f1"" target=""_blank"">trader Oxymirin wrote</a>, who holds a position on the 'no' side worth $2000.
Another bettor, who holds the opposite side of the trade, argued that given Microsoft's comfortable cash position, the company might buy a small amount of BTC.
""I think a small amount of funds will be allocated for testing. After all, shareholders' rights must be taken into consideration. Microsoft's cash position is sufficient. Microsoft offers some options for buying Bitcoin,"" a <a href=""https://polymarket.com/profile/0xb7e5f664261d08262554a350fb45ae012d14b7b6"" target=""_blank"">trader that goes by the handle of titanlin</a> wrote.

Bitcoin (BTC) resumed its ascent on Oct 3, clearing the final resistance level prior to the Sept 7 highs. While there is some short-term weakness developing, BTC is expected to eventually move above the aforementioned highs.
Bitcoin increased considerably on Oct 5, creating a large bullish candlestick.
The candlestick was important since it took the price above the Supertrend resistance line (red icon). The Supertrend is an indicator created by using the absolute high and low prices on a given day and serves as a gauge for the direction of the trend. Now, it has finally turned bullish (green circle), after being bearish since Sept 7.

10129,2017-12-21 11:30:01,5 Burning Questions for Bitcoin Investors in 2018,"Even investors who wouldn’t dare buy Bitcoin wonderhow long its bull run will last. The answers to these questions could determine when the party ends.
The lack of a regulatory road map has kept big financial institutions and asset managers from investing in cryptocurrencies. Butnew products are removing those hurdles, and bulls believe Bitcoin’s value could grow by many more multiples as Wall Street joins the fray.
Price drops of 20% or more have been routine for Bitcoin, and some have hurt more than others. After then-dominant exchange Mt. Gox was shut down by a massive hack in 2014, investors’ wariness about security kept prices in bear-market territory for two years. A comparably huge crisis could scare casual investors away.
Chinese regulators have cracked down on Bitcoin before, and concerns about speculation and leverage could lead them to do so again—sidelining some of the asset’s most avid traders.
Bitcoin is the oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency, buta crop of nimble competitors, including Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash, could lure investors away.
Many Bitcoin fans believe it will become a true global currency, one that you could spend on sandwiches or scarves the same way you’d useVisaor MasterCard today. Few people envision that happening soon, but if and when it did, it might be the end of Bitcoin’s huge price surge; for the digital coin to be useful as a currency, its value would have to stabilize.
A version of this post appears as a sidebar in the article “How High Can Bitcoin’s Price Go in 2018?” in the Jan. 1, 2018 issue of Fortune.",16449.99,0.03,16448.13,0.02,16540.0,0.58,16600.0,0.94,16445.0
33836,2019-09-23 21:46:34,"Russian Hacker Pleads Guilty to Huge Data Thefts From JPMorgan, Others","(Bloomberg) -- A Russian hacker admitted Monday that he executed the largest known cyber-attack against a U.S. bank, pleading guilty to charges that he stole data on more than 80 million clients of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other institutions that netted hundreds of millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains.
The hacker, Andrei Tyurin, 36, was accused of stealing customer information from 12 financial news companies, banks and other financial firms, including Fidelity Investments, E-Trade Financial and Dow Jones & Co. His co-conspirators used the information to ply customers with spam emails promoting stocks, hoping to cash out at higher prices, the government has said.
Tyurin, who was apprehended last year in the Republic of Georgia and extradited to the U.S., pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy, wire fraud, illegal online gambling and computer hacking. As part of the deal with prosecutors, the government will recommend that he serve 15 to 20 years behind bars, though the final decision on his sentence will be up to the judge.
Tyurin’s plea before U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan, which was expected, brings U.S. authorities a step closer to closing the book on the devastating series of attacks on the financial system from 2012 to 2015.
The enterprise extended to all manner of other illicit digital activity, including identity theft and online sales of counterfeit pharmaceuticals and malicious software, as well as hiding the true source of the proceeds to launder the money through bank accounts, prosecutors said. Some of the money was laundered through a Bitcoin exchange.
The case of the accused mastermind of the scheme, Gery Shalon, hasn’t been resolved. People familiar with the case have said he is cooperating with authorities. Several other defendants in a related case either pleaded guilty or were convicted after a trial.
There was no indication in Monday’s hearing that Tyurin is cooperating. The stiff prison sentence proposed by prosecutors suggests he may not be, because prosecutors typically ask for lenience for defendants who provide useful information.
Appearing in court in blue prison garb, his hair cropped close and his legs shackled at the ankles, Tyurin spoke entirely in Russian through an interpreter, including a lengthy series of “nyets” and “das” in response to questions from the judge. He agreed to forfeit more than $19 million, which was calculated based on the amount he and his co-conspirators agreed he would be paid for his work, prosecutor Eun Young Choi said during the hearing.
“I pleaded guilty to those counts because I am in fact guilty,” he told Swain through the interpreter. He’s scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 13.
In building their case against Tyurin, prosecutors amassed more than 3,000 pages of digital chats between him and his co-conspirators, primarily in Russian. They also recovered evidence from electronic devices seized from other defendants after they were arrested in Israel, as well as data from the companies documenting the intrusion into their networks.
Tyurin was charged in a sealed indictment in 2015, but he remained at large until his apprehension in Georgia and September 2018 extradition to the U.S.
Court filings show that Tyurin agreed to plead guilty a month ago and that he had been in negotiations with the government since the spring. He has been held at the federal jail in lower Manhattan since his extradition to the U.S.
The scope and sophistication of the hacks in the case led U.S. authorities to initially suspect it was a state-sponsored cyberattack, with potential ties to Russian intelligence. But they ultimately concluded it was the work of an independent criminal enterprise, despite evidence possessed by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia sought to recruit the hacker. Georgian authorities also said Moscow sought to have Tyurin returned to Russia after his initial arrest, to no avail.
Tyurin was the hacking genius at the keys, working with Shalon, an Israeli businessman who was arrested at his home in 2015 in a suburb of Tel Aviv. Shalon was extradited to the U.S. in 2016, but the status of the case against him is shrouded in mystery.
Shalon hasn’t appeared in court in more than three years, and hearings in his case have been rescheduled repeatedly. The federal prison registry has no record of his incarceration. What Shalon’s cooperation could yield isn’t precisely known, but it could potentially illuminate links between Russia’s cyber criminals, spy agencies and international crime networks.
Shalon had $100 million in Swiss bank accounts at the time of his arrest, and court filings show he agreed to repatriate hundreds of millions more stashed in bank accounts in Switzerland, Georgia, Cyprus, Luxembourg and Latvia.

Bitcoin volumes and volatility are still lower than ether’s but Ethereum-based opportunities have analysts optimistic for the future.
• Bitcoin(BTC) trading around $32,938 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Losing 7.6% over the previous 24 hours.

• Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,328-$2,721 (CoinDesk 20)
Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Tuesday by 7.6% as of press time. The price was above the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour, a sideways signal for market technicians.
BTC fell from $35,614 at 20:15 UTC (1:15 p.m. ET) Monday to $31,277 by 18:30 UTC (11:30 a.m. ET) Tuesday, a 12% drop based on CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin then regained some of those losses, at $32,938 as of press time.

Continued concerns about the regulatory regimefor crypto in China were among the reasons for many investors to turn bearish on bitcoin. Some traders are also worried aboutthe possibility of tighter monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which might put downward pressure on risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.
As the price of BTC fell over the past 24 hours the trading volume rose, reaching $2.9 billion as of press time on Tuesday, the most since May 28. For 2021 so far, daily averages have been at a much loftier level, around $4.9 billion, based on spot markets tracked by the CoinDesk 20.
“Bitcoin has found its footing since becoming oversold from an intermediate-term perspective within its long-term uptrend,” said technical analyst Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies. “As it stands, we would look for bitcoin to establish a lower high versus April without damaging the long-term uptrend.”

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether, was trading around $2,502 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), slipping 8.2% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is above the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour, a flat signal for market technicians.
Ether dropped from $2,721 at 23:15 UTC (4:15 p.m. ET) Monday to $2,328 by 16:15 UTC (11:30 a.m. ET) Tuesday, a 14% fall based on CoinDesk 20 data. ETH has climbed a bit since, at $2,502 as of press time.
“Ether’s short-term momentum has improved with the rebound, but intermediate-term momentum has deteriorated, supporting a lower high versus the May peak near $4,380,” noted Fairlead’s Stockton.
Ether’s momentum, in the form of volume, continues to beat bitcoin’s. For 10 straight days , the number of ETH changing hands has exceeded BTC volumes. Analysts are beginning to think this may be a longer-term trend, especially considering how much higher bitcoin volumes had been for most of the year.
Constantine Kogan, a crypto investor and founder of investment community BullPerks, thinks ether’s upstart rise in 2021 as an institutional asset is just beginning.
“Long term, I think Ethereum will grow, as proof-of-stake is proving to be a more scalable consensus mechanism,” Kogan said of the blockchain.
“Price action right now has been stronger for ETH than for BTC, and it’s shown up in the BTC/ETH correlation as well as in the derivative markets,” added Nathan Cox, chief investment officer of crypto fund Two Prime.

In the ether options market, strikes below the $2,560 price level are heavily favoring puts because traders are preparing for any possible scenario, including over 64,000 ETH total open interest at the ludicrously low $400 strike.
“The recent volatility has left traders a little spooked and willing to pay up for downside protection,” said Two Prime’s Cox. “But volatility levels all around have basically collapsed at this point, with BTC [volume] trading back to the low end of the range.”
Indeed, after jumping to over 170% in 30-day annualized volatility in late May, ETH’s price gyrations are declining, to 162% as of Monday, based on the most recent data from CoinDesk Research. Also, bitcoin’s price volatility has flattened as of late, to 89%.
“I expect some rangebound trading from here as new hands are hesitant to commit new capital, and long-term HODLers are deciding if this is the right price to continue accumulating,” said Cox. “Short term, I think you see ETH continue to outperform.”
The total crypto market cap declined on Tuesday by over 7%, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. In the market for alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, Fairlead’s Stockton sees a mostly flat-to-bullish outlook for the week ahead.
“Most cryptocurrencies have crossed bullish thresholds versus bitcoin, excludingstellarandcardano, which have neutral relative strength outlooks, andtether, which should remain out of favor while the oversold bounce persists in the space,” noted Stockton. “The cryptocurrencies pointing up and to the right should outperform, whereas downturns inuniswapandchainlinksuggest they may lag.”

29222,2018-04-29 14:33:03,Exclusive: An Interview with Sirin Labs CMO on the Blockchain Smartphone ‘Finney’,"CCN, in association with Brazilian industry outletCriptomoedas Fácil, interviewed Nimrod May, CMO of Sirin Labs, to discuss the startup’s development of the world’s first smartphone to integrate blockchain technology.
Codenamed ‘Finney’, the $1,000 smartphone will bemanufactured by global giant Foxconnand will use Android as the operating system.
CCN:Following your partnership with Foxconn, how do you see the world’s largest electronics manufacturing company help drive innovation with blockchain in the smartphone era?
N The Go Crypto revolution is growing. By choosing Foxconn to build the FINNEY, we’re demonstrating the public’s desire to have a mass-market smartphone that is able to safely and securely operate within blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
The combination of the top-tier manufacturing of Foxconn, and the innovative, agility of SIRIN LABS, who specialize in security, creates an incredibly synergistic relationship which will enable the FINNEY to flourish in a mainstream marketplace.
Q:One of the main characteristics of Finney, with plenty of hype, is to be the first cell phone in the world to integrate blockchain technology. What is the big benefit of using this technology?
Nimrod May:Currently, there are very few (if any) uses for cryptocurrency or blockchain within a mobile environment. There are 2 major factors preventing bringing cryptocurrency to a mobile environment, and by extension, preventing mass-adoption of the technology:
1. Ease of use. Cryptocurrency is currently incredibly complicated to understand. The learning curve is incredibly steep and most people have very little interest in learning it.
2. Security. Phones are hacked all the time and people are apprehensive to use and utilize cryptocurrencies on such devices.
The SIRIN OS will create a simple, secure, and streamlined user experience for both cryptocurrency and blockchain so that anyone can pick up a device and function within the world of crypto without needing to learn any additional information. Additionally, the FINNEY will contain a cold-storage wallet which is separated on both hardware and software levels from the rest of the phone. It will also have significant security built into it, such as a Machine Learning Intrusion Prevention System.
Finally, our proprietary Token Conversion Service (TCS), will be able to securely and automatically exchange between tokens and coins in the background of the phone in order to complete mobile purchases, without the need to visit an exchange to purchase tokens or coins you don’t currently own. Simply put, the TCS will enable users to use the currencies they have to complete transactions that require currencies they don’t.
These improvements have the ability to bring the technology to the masses and finally bring mass-adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency.
Q:The Finney operating system will be Android, which opens up Google’s entire app ecosystem. Will Finney support all Android apps or will app developers have to make adaptations for your phone?
Nimrod May:The SIRIN OS will contain 2 pre-installed app stores. There will be the regular Google Play store and the SIRIN LABS Decentralized App store. The Google Play store will give users the ability to download all of the apps that they are currently using on their device, without the need for the developers to make any changes. Additionally, we will be releasing an SDK so that developers will be able to release apps within the DApp store that will accept cryptocurrency as payment.
Q: With the recent scandal involving the Facebook, a debate has resurfacedon data protection and how data is obtained/stored. How will a blockchain cell phone address this issue?
Nimrod May:SIRIN LABS will be overseeing the security for the phone and the wallet in order to prevent, in real-time, malicious intrusions. However, any legitimate application’s access to your data is derived through the Android ecosystem. Ultimately, users need to be responsible for their own personal information. Apps can only have as much access as the user provides to them. When an app is downloaded, it requests permissions, and it’s up to the user to grant or deny those permissions. If your flashlight is requesting access to your contacts, maybe that’s not the best app to install.
Q: At the beginning of the project, Sirin announced that it would use ITAA’s Tanglein his project. This was reworked with a blockchain implementation announced later. Will the technologies work together or there will be a substitution entirely to blockchain?
NM: No final decisions have been made yet. We are currently working with the dev teams for IOTA, Cardano and a number of other blockchain protocol platforms in order to evaluate which would most benefit our users.
Q: Recently Lighting Labs has launched Lightning Network, a layering solution2 that promises to solve the problems of the scale of Bitcoin and to allow Atomic Swaps, among other things. Since Finney, by design, has an integrated cold walletis it possible to integrate LN in the future?
NM: Our development team is already exploring the Lightning Network for both the SIRIN OS and FINNEY.
Q:How will P2P transactions work in Finney? For example, I’m out of battery on my cell phone, how, through Token, can I buy power and charge the battery?
Nimrod May:The battery sharing was simply a “use case” for the secure P2P protocol. What our team has built within the SIRIN OS is a way to safely and securely monetize your phone’s resources through the blockchain. When activated, you will be able to trade anything from battery power through a direct connection, to processing power through the cloud, to WiFi through a local network, without fear of putting your phone’s data or security at risk, while being paid in SRN tokens through the blockchain.
Q:One of the great issues being debated by governments around the world is the regulation of the crypto-coins market. How do you think Finney can be benefited or even harmed by regulation, particularly with efforts in Europe?
Nimrod May:As stated on their website: “The objectives of the FATF are to set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system.” To this extent, we don’t see how this initiative would affect us in any way. We are a growing technology company, focusing on producing mainstream products, and who operate in complete transparency. If there are individuals who are using cryptocurrency for money laundering and terrorism, rooting those individuals out can only help cryptocurrency in general by bringing more validity to those who operate in cryptocurrency legitimately.
Q:Much has been speculated, including among governments, that blockchain technology can help reduce social inequalities and empower people and people living today the margin of society, including promoting a revolution among the unbanked population. What do you make of blockchain’s potential for inclusion?
Nimrod May:We believe that the FINNEY and SIRIN OS have the ability to aid the unbanked population tremendously. This blockchain revolution is the first time in the modern age where society will be able to safely and securely maintain their own savings without the need for a bank. Further, our proprietary secure P2P protocol has the ability to not only allow individuals within these communities to sell their products without incurring costs from distributors or retailers but will also provide a brand new revenue stream where these individuals can monetize their device’s resources.

• Brandt said that bitcoin's recent price high of near $74K has already topped according to historical data.
Peter Brandt, veteran chart analyst and CEO of Factor LLC, who was previously uber-bullish on bitcoin {{BTC}}, has switched sides.
In a report shared with CoinDesk, Brandt suggested that bitcoin’s upward trajectory may have reached its peak. This starkly contrasts hisFebruary predictionthat the bullish cycle, starting from the bear market lows in November 2022, could extend out to September 2025, with prices reachingas high as $200,000.
The latest projection is based on a statistical concept called “exponential decay,” which describes the process of reducing an amount by a consistent percentage rate over a period.
“Bitcoin has historically traded within an approximately 4yr bull/bear cycle, often associated with the halving events. There have been three major bull market cycles since the initial bull cycle and each cycle has been 80% less powerful than its predecessor in terms of the price multiple gained,” Brandt said.
“If the statistical constant of the 80% decay holds true, the [record] high in bitcoin of $73,835 of March 14, 2024, has already reached a price consistent with the historical Exponential Decay,” Brandt added.
Brandt predictedbitcoin's 2018 collapse to under $4,000.
The table shows the magnitude or gain multiple of previous bitcoin bull runs and exponential decays.
The first rally saw prices rise from $0.01 to $31.91, marking a 3,391x increase in less than two years. Subsequent bull markets have been longer in duration but smaller in magnitude, consistently suffering a roughly 80% exponential decay.
Bitcoin’s rally to record highs above $73,000 in March marked a 79.1% upswing from the bear market low of $15,473 reached after the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX in November 2022.
So, if exponential decay theory is a guide, the bull market may be over.
That said, past data does not guarantee future results, more so, as historically, Bitcoin blockchain’s quadrennial mining reward halvings have bolstered bullish trends. Thefourth reward halvingtook place on April 20, reducing the pace of per-block supply emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.5 BTC.
As such, the consensus in the crypto community is that bitcoin’s ongoing consolidation between $60,000 and $70,000 would resolve in a bullish move.
""The ‘Pre/Post Halving’ cycle construct would suggest that the current bull trend will reach a top in the $140,000 to $160,000 range sometime in late summer/early fall 2025,” Brandt said, adding that the thesis remains the primary driver of his bitcoin ownership status.
Brandt, however, added that the exponential theory remains on his radar until evidence emerges that “such decay will not influence the bull trend that began in November 2022.”

7228,2019-01-10 14:09:00,Top investor who beat the market for years says the bull could last another decade,"Hedge fund manager Jeffrey Vinik believes the current bull market could last another 10 years thanks to economic growth and low inflation. The longtime money manager said earlier Thursday that he is reviving Vinik Asset Management, the hedge fund he closed in 2013. While he declined to comment on individual investments, Vinik added that ""technology is in the middle of a 20-year run"" and that construction materials look interesting. Jeffrey Vinik, who announced the resurrection of his hedge fund on Thursday, believes that the current bull market could run for another decade. ""My belief is that we're in a secular bull market,"" Vinik said on "" Squawk Box "" Thursday morning. ""In retrospect — I didn't know it at the time — it started in 2009 and if I had to guess, we're halfway through it, driven by good economic growth and low inflation."" Vinik's upbeat prediction comes despite recent concerns that one of the longest bull markets in history may finally be winding down amid expectations for cooler GDP growth and higher borrowing costs. Though the S&P 500 is up nearly 10 percent from its recent December lows, many market participants have wondered about the longevity of employment gains and continued market success. ""We will have cyclical bear markets in between: I don't know what's going to happen in the next six months. But long-term, I'm very optimistic,"" Vinik added. The investor said the fourth-quarter plunge in the stock market was just a correction, just as a pullback beginning in 2015 was as well. Vinik rose to investing fame while running Fidelity's Magellan Fund before opening his own fund, Vinik Asset Management, in the 1990s. Over a 17-year run spanning the mid-1990s to 2013, Vinik's fund returned 17 percent annually, according to the Wall Street Journal. The longtime money manager said earlier Thursday that he is reviving his fund with ""plenty of opportunities"" drawing the investor back into the business of fundamental analysis and long/short stock picking. That model may appear antiquated to some new to Wall Street as capital flows into low-fee index funds and more and more trading is dictated by computer algorithms. Story continues While he declined to comment on specific investments, Vinik added that ""technology is in the middle of a 20-year run, just like the market is"" and that construction materials ""look interesting."" Vinik said he wants to get back to ""good old-fashioned stock picking"" and that his fund's revival isn't tied to the overall success of the stock market. He noted that even if his call for a prolonged bull market turns out to be wrong, that some volatility can be good for long/short hedge fund returns.

20717,2018-02-28 14:02:00,JACK DORSEY: Square 'is not stopping at buying and selling' bitcoin (SQ),"Reuters / Lucas Jackson
• Payments appSquarelaunched support for bitcoinin November.
• Now, CEO Jack Dorsey has doubled down on the company’s stance, saying the company ""is not stopping at buying and selling"" bitcoin.
• Shares of Square are down slightly in early trading, at $45.
Square, the payments app helmed by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, is doubling down on itscryptocurrencybet.
""Bitcoin, for us, is not stopping at buying and selling,"" Dorsey told analysts on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call. ""We do believe that this is a transformational technology for our industry and we want to learn as quickly as possible.""
For now, bitcoin’s impact on Square’s bottom line ""was really immaterial,"" Dorsey said.
In the final quarter of 2017, the company earned an adjusted $0.8 per share, beating the $0.067 that Wall Street was expecting, according to Bloomberg. Revenue of $282 million also topped the Street’s estimate.
""We also believe that it does provide an opportunity to get more people access to the financial system. And certainly, that's in stores of asset, but also ultimately, over time, through currency,"" he said.
Anestimated 2 billion people worldwide don’t have access to a bank account, according to a 2017 World Bank report. That’s a massive number that many say cryptocurrency could help bring down by making it easier for customers to prove their identity to comply with so-called “know your customer” laws.
Yet bitcoin’s wild volatility — sometimes as much as 20% in either direction on any given day — isn’t making it easy for Square.
""Today, when we offer to the buyer to purchase or to sell their ownership in the Bitcoin, we include a cushion or a margin in the price effectively to allow us to account for the fairly dynamic market that we see for Bitcoin,"" Dorsey said.
Shares of Square were down slightly, about 1%, in early trading Wednesday as traders digested the earnings report overnight.
Bitcoin is up 58% since Squareannounced it would support the cryptocurrency in November 2017, but is down 43% from its all-time high above $19,000 from December.

Yum China forecasts its profits could be reduced by 50% to 60% for the third quarter due to lockdowns in a number of Chinese provinces.
On Monday Stifel maintained its Buy rating on Starbucks but lowered its price target to $130. If Starbucks were to reach the target price, it would still be a new all-time high for the stock.

The Starbucks Chart:This week Starbucks has been working to erase some of the 8% decline the stock took between Sept. 10 and Sept. 20. On Wednesday Starbucks was attempting to break up over a resistance level at $113.45, but rejected and wicked from the area.
The decline paired with the reversal to the upside has created a bear flag on Starbucks' chart. For the flag to be negated, the stock will need to regain the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA) as support.
Starbucks has two overhead gaps and because gaps fill 90% of the time, it's likely the stock will trade up to fill the ranges in the future. The first gap is between about $117 and $118 and the second gap has a range between $123.44 and $124.21.
Starbucks is trading below the eight-day and 21-day EMAs with the eight-day trending below the 21-day, both of which are bearish indicators. On Monday Starbucks tested the 200-day simple moving average as support and has held above the level, which indicates overall sentiment is bullish.
• Bulls want to see sustained bullish volume pop Starbucks back up above the $114 level. If the stock can regain the level as support, it has room to regain the eight-day EMA and make its way up to fill the closest gap.
• Bears want to see Starbucks continue to reject its overhead resistance and then for the bear flag to be recognized, which could drop the stock back down below a support level near the $111 mark. If Starbucks were to lose the level as support, it would also fall below the 200-day SMA which could push the stock down toward the $107 area.

52772,2022-08-01 11:00:30,7 Small-Cap Growth Stocks Trading at a Huge Discount Right Now,"When equities are under pressure, it is particularly important for investors to find stocks that are trading at a discount to their intrinsic value. This can be particularly difficult if you’re interested in finding small-cap growth stocks trading at a discount.
The widely accepted definition of small-cap companies are those with a market capitalization of less than $2 billion. The allure of small-cap stocks is easy to see. The stocks generally trade for a low price. And if investors buy them at the right time, there is the possibility for outsized gains.
However, that potential for a reward also carries an outsized level of risk. And during market corrections and bear markets, these stocks can drop much further than the market average.

• 7 Stocks to Buy on the Dip
With all that said, every sector has undervalued stocks and the small-cap sector is no different. Therefore, if you’re an investor who is comfortable with the risks involved with small-cap stocks, here are seven small-cap growth stocks trading at a discount right now:
[{""Ticker"": ""HCAT"", ""Company"": ""Health Catalyst, Inc."", ""Price"": ""$16.57""}, {""Ticker"": ""CRNC"", ""Company"": ""Cerence Inc."", ""Price"": ""$27.47""}, {""Ticker"": ""FTCI"", ""Company"": ""FTC Solar, Inc."", ""Price"": ""$4.73""}, {""Ticker"": ""SIX"", ""Company"": ""Six Flags Entertainment Corporation"", ""Price"": ""$22.47""}, {""Ticker"": ""PLAY"", ""Company"": ""Dave & Buster\u2019s Entertainment, Inc."", ""Price"": ""$37.02""}, {""Ticker"": ""BLMN"", ""Company"": ""Bloomin\u2019 Brands, Inc."", ""Price"": ""$20.36""}, {""Ticker"": ""COOK"", ""Company"": ""Traeger, Inc."", ""Price"": ""$3.06""}]

The first of my small-cap growth stocks trading at a discount is a company at the convergence of healthcare and technology. Specifically,Health Catalyst(NASDAQ:HCAT) gives investors exposure to the healthcare and data analytics sectors. The company’s vision is that in the future, all healthcare decisions will be informed by data.
To that end, the company uses its cloud-based data platform and data from over 100 million patient records to help healthcare organizations make decisions that can provide measurable, data-informed decisions.
Health Catalyst is not yet profitable, but that is expected by 2024. In the meantime, the company continues to grow revenue both sequentially and on a year-over-year (YOY) basis. Both revenue and earnings are expected to grow strongly over the next five years.
HCAT stock is down 72% from its 52-week high set in July 2021 and is down 58% in 2022 alone. However, analysts are generally bullish on HCAT stock and institutional investors continue to buy it.

The next stock on my list is also a technology stock. Investing in a company such asCerence(NASDAQ:CRNC) is a bet on the idea that automobiles and the people that drive them are going to become more connected. Cerence is anartificial intelligence- (AI) powered assistant providerfor connected and autonomous vehicles.
A powerful catalyst for the company is its partnership with CerebrumX andAmazon(NASDAQ:AMZN) announced in July 2022.
This partnershipwill combine Cerence’s Connected Vehicle Digital Twin platform with CerebrumX’s deep learning platform to create an AI-powered connected vehicle data platform that is built on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Analysts are projecting Cerence to show low double-digit growth in both revenue and earnings per share in the next five years. The mean price targetamong 9 analysts is $42.11, which is approximately 52% higher than the current CRNC stock price.

Investors who are looking for small-cap growth stocks trading at a discount frequently find themselves looking at penny stocks. That’s the case withFTC Solar(NASDAQ:FTCI). The company wasestablished in 2017and has only been trading publicly since 2021.
FTCI stock dipped into penny stock range in January 2022 and remains there as of this writing. The company provides solar tracker systems, technology, software, and engineering services to a range of customers. This is another company that is not yet profitable. However, FTC Solar’s earnings and revenue are expected to show strong growth as solar usage grows across the country.
The company also received two upgrades in July 2022 and has a“strong buy”from 8 analysts that have issued ratings on FTCI stock. The company is not yet on the radar of institutional buyers, which may make it an attractive buy for retail investors.

If you’re an investor to whom the words “thrill seeker” means more than just a love of roller coasters, I would encourage you to take a second look atSix Flags Entertainment(NYSE:SIX).
I can understand why some investors would want to stay away from theme park related stocks. Depending on what metrics you look at it, the United States is already in, or headed for, a recession. And even if it’s not, the effects of inflation are being felt by consumers. It could be logical to believe that trips to a theme park may get cut out of budgets.
On the other hand, Six Flags operates properties that many consumers can access with an easy day’s drive. And thenature of these parksis that consumers can turn these excursions into a multi-day value vacation.
• 7 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy on the Dip
If you need more hard data to support that opinion, I’ll offer the fact that in the first quarter 2022 (historically the company’s weakest quarter),revenue was up 68%and earnings were up 32% on a YOY basis.

Another small-cap stock that appears to be trading at a discount isDave & Buster’s Entertainment(NASDAQ:PLAY). This is a company that was hurt badly by the restriction on gathering created by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, many entertainment venues are returning tobusiness as usual. And, as of this writing, the emergence of a new variant of Covid-19 is not expected to cause further disruption.
Assuming that remains the case, investors may want to pay attention to PLAY stock. We are heading into the heart of fantasy football draft season and Dave & Buster’s haspackages set upfor league commissioners to level up their live draft experiences.
PLAY stock is down 10% in 2022 and it may be concerning to investors that it has failed to hold on to the gains it made after posting strong first quarter earnings. Still, analysts remain mostly bullish on the stock, which has an attractive price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and expectations for strong growth in revenue and earnings in the next five years.

Just as the restaurant industry was beginning to lift its metaphorical head above the waters of the pandemic, inflation is threatening to pull it back under. You can put it under the category of revenge spending, but for the first half of 2022, consumers appeared to have an appetite for dining out.
And that was good forBloomin’ Brands(NASDAQ:BLMN). The company posted earnings and revenue that was higher not just on a YOY basis, but at higher levels than in the year before the pandemic. Some of this can be attributed to the company’s portfolio of popular, recognizable brands.
• 7 Seriously Undervalued Dividend Stocks to Buy for High Total Returns
But what does the second half of the year suggest? Analysts believe the company is headed for further growth. BLMN stock offers 55% upside from its Jul. 26, 2022 price. Backing up that price target is a low P/E ratio of just 8x earnings. And earnings are expected to grow at a high single-digit level over the next five years.

The last of our small-cap growth stocks trading at a discount isTraeger(NYSE:COOK). The company makes its namesake wood pellet grills that combine an internet of things component. That makes these products ideal for millennial homeowners who are looking to accessorize their indoor and outdoor living spaces. It also capitalizes on the popularity of posting social-media worthy culinary creations.
The company may have picked the wrong time to go public. Since its initial public offering in July 2021, COOK stock has dropped nearly 80% and is now trading as a penny stock. With that said, earnings and revenue are expected to grow strongly over the next five years.
While analysts are bullish on the stock in general, many analysts lowered their price targets in the past few months. That may mean that bad news is already priced in. If the company can continue to deliver solid earnings and revenue, there may be an upside surprise.

19022,2018-02-14 20:27:27,Bizarre snow spirals are forming in the wondrous land we call Canada,"If you love snow, Canada is a pretty fantastic place to be, but a strange phenomenon is being observed in some parts of the country that is capturing the imaginations of everyone, regardless of their affinity (or lack thereof) for the powdery white stuff. Bizarre snow rollers, which are chunks of snow that roll themselves into larger spirals, have been captured on video, and they look like pure witchcraft. Theyre quite a sight to behold, but theres actually a well-documented natural recipe for these strange snow donuts. A mix of wind and a very specific condition of snow is required for them to form, and its a rare occurrence. Don't Miss : Amazon has $9.99 LED light bulbs that can be controlled by Alexa and Google Assistant These delicate formations need just the right mix of moisture, snow, wind, and temperature, the National Weather Service explains. The snow has to be a light dusting, sticky enough to adhere to itself but on a surface that it wont cling to. The wind has to be strong enough to encourage these mounds of snow to curl up and form their signature loop, but not so strong that the whole thing gets blown apart. Alternatively, the snow could be on a hill and gently roll downslope to form the same shape. Wind speeds need to be around 30 miles per hour for the snow to begin its roll, but no faster, as speedy winds will tear the rolls apart before they have a chance to grow to their full potential. Because a straight and steady wind is required, snow rollers arent normally seen in larger cities. Rural areas with large spaces of flat land are much more likely to produce the odd phenomenon. Even rarer than the snow rollers themselves is the fact that this time they were captured in the process of forming. In any case, its a pretty fantastic little clip, and a friendly reminder that Canada is a land of magic and wonder. And lots and lots of snow.

72657,2023-04-05 14:27:38,A Football Field-Sized Boat Will Service US Offshore Wind Farms,"(Bloomberg) -- At a Louisiana shipyard Tuesday, construction slowed so executives, politicians and reporters could tour a boat that’s almost as long as a football field. Some workers welded steel bulkheads, while others used an industrial press the size of a trailer to bend metal. At the center of the activity sat the Eco Edison, a concrete and expensive sign that some companies are pressing ahead in the fledgling offshore wind industry. Most Read from Bloomberg Google and Amazon Struggle to Lay Off Workers in Europe Nassim Taleb On What Bitcoiners, Anti-Vaxxers, VCs and Deadlifters Are Getting Wrong China Restraint on Taiwan Shows Xi Has Bigger Concerns Now Top Tax Mistakes to Avoid If You Make More Than $100,000 Stocks Rise Amid Hopes for ‘Just Right’ Jobs Print: Markets Wrap When completed next year, the boat is expected to be the first US-built vessel to service offshore wind farms. Over the past six months, inflation and political pushback have become significant challengers for offshore wind, a sector that the Biden administration sees as a crucial source of power in the push to purge fossil fuels from the electric grid. Rising costs delayed two huge farms off the coast of Massachusetts by at least a year. Republican lawmakers seized on a rash of whale deaths to demand the whole industry stop in its tracks. And when Rhode Island asked developers to propose a new wind farm, it received just a single bid. Even Danish energy giant Orsted AS, one of the companies building the big boat in Louisiana, said it would take a hit of about $365 million on a farm it’s building off New York. None of that has deterred Orsted or Massachusetts utility Eversource Energy from continuing construction of the 262-foot Eco Edison. “This shipyard and this vessel are living proof that the US offshore wind industry is creating jobs today,” David Hardy, chief executive officer for Orsted in the Americas, said at the shipyard on Tuesday. While offshore wind has a more established track record in Europe — though it faces challenges there, too — the industry is basically starting from scratch in the US after a decade of stumbles. The first large farms are scheduled to start producing power later this year, and President Joe Biden has set a goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. (One gigawatt is roughly equal to the electricity-generating capacity of a large nuclear reactor or natural gas-fired power plant.) Story continues Read More: Wind Farms Fall Victim to Global Inflation Fight That goal was given a boost last year by the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. The landmark climate legislation includes valuable tax credits for clean energy, but developers are eager for Internal Revenue Service guidance on how exactly those tax credits will be implemented. “It’s great that the law was passed, but until we understand the nuances we can’t really count on that,” Hardy said. In the meantime, the country’s offshore ambitions could lead to significant economic activity. Orsted and Eversource declined to share how much the Eco Edison will ultimately cost, but the boat employs some 400 local workers and boasts a supply chain crossing 34 states. “There’s going to be a lot more to come,” said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Republican who represents the district where the boat is being built.The Eco Edison will operate out of Long Island, New York, to service the wind farms Orsted and Eversource are building in the Atlantic Ocean: the South Fork Wind, Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind farms. Together those projects are expected to generate enough electricity to power more than 1 million homes. That power will be especially valuable during cold Northeast winters, said Eversource Vice President Mike Ausere, when natural gas prices can jump as the fuel is needed for both electricity generation and heating. “You asked about momentum? We're going full-tilt,” Ausere said. (Updates with comment from Eversource in 10th paragraph.)

81318,2024-12-25 10:51:00,Better Buy in 2025: XRP or Bitcoin?,"Cryptocurrency investors are having a great year in 2024. The total value of all coins and tokens across the industry currently stands at $3.5 trillion, more than doubling from where it ended in 2023.
Industry-leading cryptocurrencies likeBitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC)are responsible for most of that added value, but many tokens at the more speculative end of the market have also delivered solid gains. EvenXRP(CRYPTO: XRP), which was under a dark regulatory cloud until recently, is up by 250% in 2024.
Falling interest rates are driving demand for growth assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. Investors are also hopeful that the incoming Trump administration will be more crypto-friendly than previous administrations. That could set the stage for new opportunities for the industry to create value.
XRP could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of that regulatory shift, but will it be a better buy than Bitcoin in 2025?
Global banking is complicated. Sending money around the world can take days. Some financial institutions use the SWIFT payment network, whereas others don't, which means they need an intermediary to act as a middleman for each transaction.
A company calledRipplesought to fix that problem. Its Ripple Payments (formerly RippleNet) network connects with all existing banking infrastructure, so financial institutions can talk to each other directly and settle transactions instantly.
Ripple also created the XRP crypto token to standardize those transactions. For example, an American bank might send XRP to a Japanese bank rather than sending American dollars, which would eliminate currency exchange fees and other transaction costs. The two banks can then handle their own conversions from XRP to the fiat currency of their choice.
There are 100 billion XRP tokens in existence. 57 billion are in circulation, and Ripple holds the other 43 billion, releasing up to 1 billion per month to meet institutional demand. In 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple, because the regulator believed the XRP token should be classified as a financial security (like a stock or a bond), which would place tight restrictions on how it is issued and how the company operates.
The lawsuit was partially resolved in August 2024. Ripple was hit with a $125 million fine. The judge determined that XRP was only a security in certain situations, such as when new tokens are sold to institutions, but not when it's traded on crypto exchanges or used in transactions.
The SEC is appealing the decision, but President-Elect Donald Trump recently nominated pro-crypto businessman Paul Atkins to run the regulatory agency during his administration (pending Senate approval). Therefore, investors are hoping that Ripple's legal woes will disappear after Jan. 20, once the new government takes office.
That's why the bulk of XRP's year-to-date gain occurred after the election on Nov. 5. But the token is trading at $2.21 as of this writing, which is still well below its record high of $3.40 from 2018. It could move higher next year, butXRP is still a speculative asset, so investors should exercise caution.
Unlike XRP, Bitcoin isn't backed by any individual or company that can issue more supply. There are 19.8 million Bitcoins in circulation right now, but there will only ever be a maximum of 21 million. The total supply is expected to be fully mined by the year 2140.
As a result, Bitcoin has never faced the regulatory woes that Ripple did. In fact, the SEC even approved dozens of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this year, which give financial advisors and institutional investors a safer, regulated way to own it. The Bitcoin ETF industry already manages more than $110 billion in assets, so demand is incredibly strong.
Bitcoin consistently climbed to new highs even after suffering steep corrections over the years, which isn't the case for most cryptocurrencies. Along with its limited supply and decentralized nature, that's a key reason why investors are warming up to it as a true store of value.
Some analysts refer to Bitcoin as a digital version of gold. The total value of all above-ground gold reserves currently stands at $17.7 trillion, so Bitcoin's market capitalization ($1.9 trillion as of this writing) would have to grow by 831% to catch up. That implies a price of around $893,000 per Bitcoin.
Then there is Michael Saylor, the co-founder ofMicroStrategy, which owns over 439,000 Bitcoins (which is more than 2% of the total supply). He predicts Bitcoin will soar to $13 million per coin by the year 2045, because he thinks the U.S. could establish a digital assets framework that will open the door to new use cases and pave the way for widespread adoption.
Since that implies a Bitcoin market capitalization of $257 trillion, which is almost nine times the size of the entire U.S. economy in 2023, $13 million per coin isprobablya little optimistic, even accounting for the dollar's inflation in the next two decades.
The Ripple Payments network is very innovative, but there's a hitch: Banks aren't required to use XRP. They can transact in fiat currencies and still benefit from instant transfers, so the success of Ripple Payments won't necessarily send the price of XRP higher.
That makes XRP a highly speculative cryptocurrency, and it's very difficult to predict where it will move next.
Don't get me wrong -- Bitcoin is also a speculative asset. Despite the SEC's blessing and an avalanche of bullish price targets from prominent experts, investors still buy it because they hope it will rise in price, not because it generates earnings or has any utility in the real world.
However, Bitcoinhasproven itself a good store of value so far. That alone will make it an attractive place for investors to park some of their money for the foreseeable future, and ETFs make it simpler than ever for them to do so. As a result, I think Bitcoin has a better chance to deliver upside in 2025 than XRP.

46829,2021-04-28 17:28:28,Microsoft is replacing its default Office font - and wants you to pick the new one,"(Microsoft) Microsoft is looking for its new default font and is encouraging users to decide which it will be. The company’s default font on all Microsoft products has been Calibri , which replaced Times New Roman in 2007. There are now five new contenders for the default font: Tenorite, Bierstadt, Skeena, Seaford, and Grandview. We need to talk. What should our next default font be? pic.twitter.com/fV9thfdAr4 — Microsoft (@Microsoft) April 28, 2021 “The degree to which seemingly minute differences in typography can create visceral responses”, Microsoft says, is apparently “a testament to the art and science of font design.” The various fonts described “pan the various sans-serif styles—humanist, geometric, swiss-style, and industrial”, Microsoft adds. Tenorite, by Erin McLaughlin and Wei Huang, “has the overall look of a traditional workhorse sans serif”, and is round, wide, and crisp, according to the designers. Its tight fit apparently allow for more words to fit on a line yet has “generous character spacing”. Bierstadt, by Steve Matteson, is inspired by mid-20th century Swiss typography. It has large, block-style letters with little flourishes or contrast between thick and thin strokes. “Microsoft already has Arial—which has many attributes from grotesque types preceding Helvetica—and my approach was to design a sans serif which would contrast with Arial by being far more mechanical and rationalized,” Matteson says. “The terminal endings are precisely sheared at 90 degrees—a modern note contrasting the softer, angled endings in Arial—and a lack of somewhat fussy curves found in Arial’s ‘a’, ‘f’, ‘y’ and ‘r’.” Skeena, by John Hudson and Paul Hanslow, is a “humanist” sans serif font with modulated strokes and a noticeable contrast between thick and thin lines, apparently making it ideal for body text in long documents. That contrast is usually associated with luxury branding, which work in large type but can be “unsightly and … brittle” if too small. Story continues Seaford,by Tobias Frere-Jones, Nina Stössinger, and Fred Shallcrass, is “gently organic and asymmetric”, but should be useful for forms as the differences between letters should make recognisable word shapes “To pinpoint the kind of familiarity and “comfort” the typeface should evoke, we also looked at pictures of old armchairs … nothing overtly plushy or nostalgic”,Stössinger says. “When it comes to italics, it turns out there are parallels between chair ergonomics and typography: rather than inflating it and making it softer, trust the rigid moments that are good for your back.” The last entry is Grandview, by Aaron Bell. derived from classic German road and railway signage, and made to be legible at distance and under poor weather conditions, Bell made the font wider while keeping the height the same. This made it more legible for body text, where it was not often used. The five fonts are currently available to use, and Microsoft will be using polling and “feedback and comments on social” as to which will be chosen. Once a decision is made, it will become the new default font in 2022.

75630,2023-09-13 13:33:01,The Senate is getting sick of crypto,"Proof of State is the Wednesday edition of Fortune Crypto where Leo Schwartz delivers insider insights on policy and regulation.
Last November may have been a low point for the crypto industry, but it was a high watermark for interest in D.C. The (30-year-old) boy wonder Sam Bankman-Fried had spent months roaming the halls of the Capitol, buying access and nearly a crypto bill.
In the wake of FTX's collapse, it was quickly apparent that his preferred legislation, the Senate Agriculture Committee's Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, was no longer feasible. Despite the potential for lawmaking drying up, Congress still wanted to separate itself from the stench of his influence, with key committees holdingpublic hearingsto figure out what had gone so wrong. As regulatory agencies like the SEC and CFTC stepped up enforcement actions, evenoversight hearingsgravitated around crypto.
We're nearly a year removed from the scandal, and Congress has moved on. That reality was laid bare at a hearing yesterday at the Senate Banking Committee with SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the favorite punching bag of the crypto industry and Republican party. If this had been six months ago, crypto would have dominated the discussion. SEC critics like Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) would have ripped into the agency's ""regulation by enforcement"" approach, and backers like Chair Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) would have championed Gensler's steady hand.
To be fair, both parties expressed these sentiments, with Hagerty asking about the status of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and Brown lauding Gensler's efforts to ""crack down on abuse and enforce the law."" Even so, they felt like afterthoughts. Hagerty rushed to ask his ETF question before time ran out, and the vast majority of senators on the committee didn't even mention digital assets. Presidential candidate and ranking member Tim Scott (R-S.C.) sheepishly implored his colleagues to ask about crypto after his five minutes were up.
It may come as a shock, but the SEC and Gensler have other subjects in their remit (with his handling of areas like ESG and private funds just as controversial as crypto), and most senators pursued other lines of questions, from private equity to the speed of rulemaking. AI seemed to be the shiny object to take crypto's place, with committee members asking about deepfakes and financial stability.
A central factor for passing legislation is a committee chair willing to spend political capital on the effort. House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), along with House Agriculture Chair Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.), have made it clear that crypto is a top priority. That sentiment is not shared in the Senate, nor in the White House, which appeared toblockany bipartisan deal on stablecoin legislation in July. It's not just that Brown is skeptical of the need for crypto regulation—it's just no longer an area of focus for his committee.
The one possible exception would be a bill or amendment focused on national security and anti-money laundering—a cause championed by a number of senators on the committee, including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). But even they declined to ask Gensler any crypto-related questions during the hearing.
The only senator to lead off with a blockchain-related question? Cynthia Lummis, the Bitcoiner from Wyoming. If only every lawmaker changed their profile picture to laser eyes.

73956,2024-01-10 15:14:56,How To Earn $500 A Month From JPMorgan Stock Ahead Of Q4 Earnings Report,"JPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE:JPM) is expected to release earnings results for its fourth quarter, before theopening bell on Jan. 12, 2023.
Analysts expect the company to report quarterly earnings at $3.40 per share on revenue of $39.77 billion, according toBenzinga Pro. On Tuesday, Deutsche Bank analyst Matt O'Connor upgraded JPMorgan Chase from Hold to Buy and raised the price target from $140 to $190.
JPMorgan Chase CEOJamie Dimonrecently reiterated his long-standing opposition toBitcoinand other cryptocurrencies, going so far as to suggest the governmentshould shut down the industry.
With the recent buzz around JPMorgan, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now, JPMorgan has a dividend yield of 2.46%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of $1.05 a share ($4.20 a year).
To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from JPMorgan dividends, we start with a yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).
Next, we take this amount and divide it by JPMorgan’s $4.20 dividend: $6,000 / $4.20 = 1,429 shares
So, an investor would need to own approximately $243,873 worth of JPMorgan, or 1,429 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.
Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $4.20 = 286 shares, or $48,809 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.
The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.
For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).
Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).
Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.

20383,2018-02-25 14:32:00,Trump's Solar Tariffs Already Facing Legal Challenges,"When the Trump Administrationimplemented tariffs on solar importslate last month, it was only a matter of time before they faced legal challenges. Countries where solar manufacturing is located were likely to challenge the tariffs, and the World Trade Organization (WTO) seemed like the place where the biggest battle would take place.
It only took a few weeks, but those challenges are already taking shape. And they could alter how solar manufacturers make decisions about manufacturing in the future.
Image source: Getty Images.
There are several venues where the tariffs will be challenged, and I think investors should think about them in two buckets: North American challenges at NAFTA and a global effort to fight tariffs at the World Trade Organization.
NAFTA:Canada and Mexico are both going to challenge Trump's solar tariffs. Three Canadian companies have already filed a lawsuit against the Trump Administration in the United States Court of International Trade, in part based on the argument that it violates NAFTA. Mexico has also promised action to challenge both solar and washing-machine tariffs imposed in January. If the challenge is successful, the biggest winner would beSunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR), which has most of its solar panel assembly in Mexico, both for high-efficiency X-Series and commodity solar cell-based P-Series products.Canadian Solar(NASDAQ: CSIQ)also has a small amount of manufacturing in Canada, which could be affected by the tariff challenge.
WTO:The bigger long-term threat to solar tariffs comes from the WTO, where South Korea has already filed a complaint and China has demanded compensation for the tariffs. A challenge at the WTO could take two years or more, but it could also lead to the Trump Administration having to abandon the tariffs altogether.
The NAFTA challenge definitely seems to be the fastest track to potential tariff relief, with the process starting in only a few weeks, but there's no guarantee that either avenue will lead to reduced tariffs for solar manufacturers.
When a company decides if it is going to build manufacturing capacity in the U.S., it needs to consider how long tariffs will give it an advantage in the U.S. -- especially considering that when tariffs end, solar panels made in the U.S. will likely have higher costs than those made in Latin America or Asia.
JinkoSolarhasannounced a U.S. plant, and a trio of Taiwanese cell manufacturers are eyeing the U.S., but there isn't a flood of manufacturing moving here now that the tariffs have been introduced. That's because executives aren't certain the tariffs will last the full four years of the current ruling. And with hundreds of millions of dollars on the line, they can't take chances on getting the bet wrong.
When I talked to him following the fourth-quarter earnings announcement, SunPower CEO Tom Werner said there was almost no chance his company would build a U.S. manufacturing plant because of tariffs, instead choosing to pay the tariffs or look elsewhere for sales. Particularly in the high-efficiency side of the market, taking two years to build a solar plant and risking the reduction of tariffs in the meantime is too big of a risk.
Depending on how the tariff challenges go, the entire solar industry could be affected. There's upside for some companies like SunPower and Canadian Solar if early challenges are successful, while for manufacturers likeFirst Solar(NASDAQ: FSLR)that are getting awindfall from tariffs on competitors, the advantage may not last. Ultimately, a courtroom could decide the tariffs' future.

72562,2024-11-13 20:17:03,Dollar hits one-year high on Trump trades,"By Chibuike Oguh
NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar advanced to one-year high against major currencies on Wednesday powered by so-called Trump trades and after U.S. inflation for October came in as expected, suggesting the Federal Reserve will continue lowering interest rates.
The greenback hit its highest level since November 2023, buoyed by Donald Trump's victory in last week's U.S. presidential election, which sparked expectations of potentially inflationary tariffs and other measures by his incoming administration.
Trump's Republican Party will also control both houses of Congress when he takes office in January, Edison Research projected on Wednesday, enabling him to push an agenda of cutting taxes and shrinking the federal government.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro,rose 0.43% to 106.44 after reaching as high as 106.53.
""I'm not sure the inflation data pushed things around too much since it was pretty much in line with expectations,"" said Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies.
""I think it's just continuation of the Trump trade kind of mindset ... leading to strengthen the dollar on a broad basis but also kind of a flushing of some of the EM [emerging market] long positions.""
Labor Department data on Wednesday showed the U.S. consumer price index rose 0.2% for the fourth straight month, in line with economists' expectations, amid higher costs for shelter such as rents. In the 12 months through October, the CPI advanced 2.6%.
U.S. Treasury yields fell following the inflation data, with the 2-year note yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, dropping 6.5 basis points to 4.279%.
""So certainly there was a lot of concern going into the number as it's just one of the new bricks in this kind of wall of worry; so there's a little bit of a relief rally and yields are lower,"" said Marvin Loh, senior global market strategist at State Street in Boston.
""It just shows how on edge the market is based on the Fed, based on inflation, and certainly based on this nebulous Trump trade. The dollar seems to be one of the cleanest, easiest ways of playing the Trump trade as well as bitcoin, it seems.""
Bitcoin surged past the $90,000 level for the first time, powered by euphoria from Trump's election victory and expectations that his administration will be beneficial to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin gained 2.75% to $90,734.00. Ethereum declined 3.11% to $3,178.60.
Japan's wholesale inflation accelerated in October at the fastest annual pace in more than a year, complicating the Bank of Japan's decision on how soon to raise interest rates.
The yen broke through 155 per dollar, the Japanese currency's weakest level since late July. It was last at 155.46 yen per dollar.
The euro continued its descent amid expectations of potential Trump tariffs. Political uncertainty in Germany, the bloc's biggest economy, has also weighed on the currency following the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's governing coalition last week and with snap elections set for Feb. 23.
The euro was down 0.51% at $1.0569. It had dropped to as low as $1.055575, its lowest level since November 2023.
The dollar was flat at 7.243 versus the offshore Chinese yuan. Against the Swiss franc , the dollar strengthened 0.43% to 0.885.

30818,2021-10-20 09:47:56,Riding the crypto rollercoaster: Bitcoin nears record high,"By Tom Wilson LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin is on the cusp of an all-time high, its latest rally fuelled by the launch of the first U.S. bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund that investors think could make the cryptocurrency accessible for swathes of new investors. But the advent of cryptocurrency ETFs in the world's biggest economy hasn't been the only driver of this chapter of bitcoin's 2021 rollercoaster. Here are some charts that look at dynamics of its push towards a record high. 1. WILD SWINGS CONTINUE Bitcoin is known for wild price swings, its 13-year history peppered by vertiginous ascents and equally steep drops. Its performance this autumn has been no different. The world's biggest cryptocurrency has soared more than 60% since mid-September, gaining more than 46% in October alone. Yet it has also seen dramatic plunges this year. After powering to its current record of $64,895 in mid-April, bitcoin slumped by more than half in just 35 days, with a crackdown by China on cryptocurrencies among the factors. Among the primary reasons for its rally in recent weeks, analysts said, were bets that U.S. regulators allowing the first bitcoin futures ETF would open the path for greater investment by both retail and institutional investors. Tony Sycamore of City Index said such products ""will open up exposure to bitcoin to a large segment of investors who have a brokerage account and are comfortable buying stocks and ETFs, but do not desire to go through the hassle and learning curve of establishing another account with a cryptocurrency provider"".

INFLOWS RISE AGAIN Yet even ahead of the new ETF launching, inflows to existing bitcoin exchange-traded funds and products were growing sharply. Average weekly flows to bitcoin funds totalled $121.1 million in October, up from $31.2 million a month earlier, data from London-based CryptoCompare shows. They had fallen into negative territory for the three months before, the outflows following bitcoin's sharp losses in May and June. Story continues ""We had a pretty steep sell-off for bitcoin in the summer. The price action has been a recovery from a low,"" said Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, a crypto indexes provider. ""Bitcoin was just seen as cheap - anything below $30,000, drew a lot of investors, and particularly institutional ones.""

With inflation rising in many large economies, investors are increasingly betting that major central banks will as a result raise rates. Against that backdrop, some market players say, bitcoin's purported inflation-proof qualities have also driven recent gains. Since the start of July, bitcoin has gained almost 85%. Some inflation hedge assets have done better, with inflation-linked bonds - the U.S. TIPS Index - gaining more than 140%. Gold is flat over the same period. ""We could see higher interest rates straining global equity markets,"" said Joel Kruger at crypto exchange LMAX Digital. ""Bitcoin's going to be very well supported on this longer-term store value proposition, and on this hedge against inflation proposition.""
