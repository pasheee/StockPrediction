That, inevitably, has had some people waiting for a fall, and it took a big one this week. While things have since bounced back, the value of the currency on the so-called Mt. Gox exchange dropped from around $17.50 to justone centin a matter of moments during the early hours of June 20th -- a drop that's since been attributed to a compromised account. Thanks to a daily withdrawal limit, however, that apparently only resulted in $1,000 actually being stolen, and a claims process has now been set up for those affected.While not directly related to the sell off, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (orEFF) also dealt a bit of a blow to the upstart currency this week, when it announced that it would no longer be accepting Bitcoin donations. According to the organization, that's both because it doesn't \"fully understand the complex legal issues involved with creating a new currency system,\" and because it doesn't want its acceptance of Bitcoins misconstrued as an endorsement of Bitcoin.

         "Have you heard of Bitcoin? If you're a fan of the NBC legal drama The Good Wife , then you may have learned of it for the first time there. But if you're like most, you probably didn't know that Bitcoin existed or even what it is. You know of the dollar, the euro and the peso as ways to buy items and get paid for your service, but these fiat currencies as they are called may someday be replaced by a virtual currency that is only in digital form. So, how does it work? History The mechanics behind digital currency appear complicated, but the major problem facing it is easy to understand. What would keep you from using it more than once? Assuming your digital currency was placed in your digital wallet, why couldn't you send it out to multiple people at the same time? With traditional currency, there is a physical exchange and unless you have exceptional resources that allow you to counterfeit, you can only use it once until you earn it back. Because of that, digital currency has to be encrypted and just like with a credit card, there has to be some kind of clearing facility that keeps track of when a currency is used and who owns it. The early digital currencies were based around this idea, but having one central place seemed like a recipe for corruption to the creators. So they made the clearing house a process that happened on computers all over the world instead of just one place. They also didn't want the value of the currency to be controlled by a central bank, the way traditional currencies are controlled. The bitcoin system releases a set amount on a certain schedule. In order to earn bitcoins, they have to be mined, much like gold but in a digital format. A complicated cryptographic puzzle has to be solved in order to activate the bitcoin, and the first person to solve it was the successful miner of the bitcoin block and now owns it. Bitcoins started with pennies in value in April of 2010, but quickly rose thereafter. As the value rose, more bitcoin miners set up powerful systems to unlock the new bitcoin codes.

The number of mobile subscribershas grown almost 20 percentyear-over-year for the past five years, theGSM Associationreports, leading to expectations thatthere will be more than 735 million subscriberson the African continent by the end of 2012. \"It may seem unlikely, given its track record in technological development,\" The Guardian's Killian Foxwrote last year, \"but Africa is at the center of a mobile revolution.\"\nSo people are already carrying the tools that could facilitate Bitcoin-based exchanges, Koch notes. From there -- and particularly as prices for the phones that use Google's Android software continue to drop -- \"the Bitcoin community,\" Koch argues, could create open-source technology that builds on mobile operating systems to create Bitcoin-based apps. Koch imagines \"a design similar to the Bitcoin for Android app, which allows one person to transfer bitcoins to another by using a phone to snap a photo of a 2D bar code or QR code on the screen of another phone\" -- creating a society and an economy in which \"people could exchange money when they meet on the street.\"\nOr, well, \"money.\"\nMore From The Atlantic\n• Who Loves Inflation?

Interestingly, this doesn't actually mean that MasterCard won't be involved... just that the company isn't at this point in the process.

         "Claim of Romney taxes theft a puzzling whodunit",
         "WASHINGTON (AP) — Assuming it's not a hoax, the purported theft of Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's tax returns has all the trappings of a high-tech whodunit: a politically themed burglary, a $1 million demand in hard-to-trace Internet currency, password-protected data and a threat to reveal everything in three more weeks. But can it be believed? The Secret Service and FBI were investigating the case Thursday after someone claimed to have burglarized a PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting office in Franklin, Tenn., and stolen two decades' worth of Romney's tax returns. The claimed theft, made in an anonymous letter sent to the accounting firm and political offices in Tennessee, has surfaced a critical moment during the 2012 presidential campaign amid the Republican and Democratic conventions. The ransom target in the case — Romney's tax returns — was carefully selected: Romney, worth an estimated $250 million, has steadfastly declined to make public more than one year's tax returns so far, and Democrats have sought to portray him as so wealthy he is out of touch with middle class voters. Authorities are studying computer thumb drives that were delivered with an unusual demand: a $1 million payment in \"Bitcoin\" Internet currency. The letter said the tax returns delivered on the thumb drives were encrypted, and more copies would be sent to \"all major news media outlets.\" It promised to reveal the password to unlock the tax returns on Sept. 28 if payment is not made. PricewaterhouseCoopers has said there was no evidence that anything was stolen. The alleged culprit suggested an insider helped in the burglary and theft from the firm's network file servers, knowingly or unwittingly: \"We are sure that once you figure out where the security breach was, some people will probably get fired, but that is not our concern,\" the letter said. The plot in this mystery has enough holes that it could be an elaborate hoax. But it comes at a critical moment during the 2012 presidential campaign. In its broadest outlines, the case might be compared to Watergate, the 1972 political break-in that led to President Richard Nixon's resignation. But unlike Watergate, which started with the arrest of bungling burglars traced to Republicans, the Tennessee case is a baffling mystery so far, without any clear suspects. There is no evidence Democrats were involved. Story continues \"I looked at the letter and thought, 'Who on earth thinks we're gullible enough to fall for this?'\" said Peter Burr, chairman of the Williamson County Democratic Party, which received one of the thumb drives and a copy of the extortion letter last week. He kept the letter and data device, growing curious about them as days passed. He rightly feared the thumb drive might be infected with a computer virus. \"I had reached the point of seriously considering putting it in an old computer we have here in the office where we weren't worried if the hard drive got trashed or not,\" Burr said. \"But by then we had received recommendations from our attorneys and word from the Secret Service. So we didn't look at it.\" It was unclear even among experts whether the purported theft might be a hoax. The alleged culprit so far has provided no evidence that Romney's tax returns actually were stolen, such as a scan of a partial page from one of the documents. But for seasoned and committed hackers such a theft was described as entirely plausible, especially for someone who could gain physical access to a company's keyboards. \"So far, there's just zero proof. It's like every bad Hollywood plot, which makes me think this is fishy,\" said Marc Maiffret, chief technology officer for BeyondTrust Software Inc. of Carlsbad, Calif. \"But any competent hacker, any good penetration-tester, if they wanted to get Mitt Romney's tax returns, it wouldn't be that hard to do. These breaches are absolutely possible. If you can sit at the computer it would take two minutes to bypass the log-in information.\" \"The only time you're going to hold something over someone's head is if they're trying to keep stuff secret,\" Maiffret said. A former FBI cyber-crime expert, Michael J. Gibbons, said the unusual ransom demand sounded similar to popular email fraud scams. \"This sounds more like a Nigerian letter scam than an organized hacking attempt,\" said Gibbons, former chief of FBI computer crimes investigations and now a managing director at Alvarez & Marsal in Washington. \"It doesn't pass the smell test.\" There was no sign a thumb drive had been delivered to The Associated Press. A spokeswoman for the New York Times, Eileen Murphy, said the newspaper had not received one, either. The Wall Street Journal declined to comment. Politicians previously have found themselves targets in burglaries, thefts and hacking. Candidates and political parties have reported dozens of break-ins across the U.S. In 2007, for example, Barack Obama's Iowa field office reported a burglary that netted two laptop computers and campaign literature. The next year, a University of Tennessee student was arrested for hacking into Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's personal email account. He was later convicted of obstruction of justice and unauthorized access to a computer. He served an 11-month prison sentence. The demand in the latest case for $1 million in Bitcoin currency would complicate efforts to trace any payments over the Internet, but U.S. authorities have successfully uncovered such trails in other cases. \"It's definitely harder than normal to uncover someone's financial identity,\" Maiffret said. \"But our government, we find a lot of bad guys in the world in cyber-crime and terrorism cases by following the money trails.\" Gibbons agreed: \"It's an ineffective cloak of anonymity,\" he said. Even if the latest case were a hoax, hackers have been alerted to intense public interest in Romney's personal finances. \"You've got every hacker in the world thinking, 'Wouldn't that be awesome to do?'\" Maiffret said. \"I have a feeling this is going to be a hoax, but you're going to have copycats who are going to try to do this.\" While the extortionist's demand for $1 million appears to preclude political motivations, a prosecutor in the original Watergate burglary said motives aren't always apparent. \"In the Watergate case, it wasn't clear at the outset what the motivation was,\" said Earl J. Silbert, a former U.S attorney in the case. \"Even today there are differences of opinion over what was behind it.\" ___ Associated Press writers Erik Schelzig in Nashville, Tenn., and Ted Bridis in Washington contributed to this report."

Earlier this year, the company offloaded $2.4 billion worth of assets, including this transaction.The sale is anticipated to complete in the first quarter of 2013, subject to regulatory approval.New York City, New York-based Hess Corporation, previously known as Amerada Hess Corporation, is an integrated energy company engaged in oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) and refining as well as marketing.Hess’ new strategy of concentrating on high-impact exploration areas compared to low risk areas; its exposure to areas with high resource potential (such as Brazil, Ghana, Libya and offshore Australia), strong growth throughout the Bakken oil shale play, along with robust holdings in the Eagle Ford Shale and the Utica Shale are expected to raise its earnings, cash flow and valuation.However, we believe that future asset sales will likely hamper the company's production and bring down its profitability levels.Considering the situation, we expect the stock to perform in line with other industry players and the broader market and maintain our long-term Neutral recommendation on Hess. The company retains a Zacks #3 Rank (equivalent to a short-term Hold rating).\nVisa Hikes Dividend 50%\nEarlier this week,Visa Inc.(V) announced a 50% hike in its quarterly dividend to the holders of its class A, B and C equity shares. Consequently, the company will pay a quarterly dividend of 33 cents per share, up from 22 cents paid in the prior quarter.\nThis takes the annual cash dividend of Visa to $1.32 per share, compared with 88 cents paid earlier. Considering the closing share price of $136.49 on October 24, 2012, the increased dividend translates into a dividend yield of 97%, substantially higher than 64% paid earlier.\nThe increased dividend will be paid on December 4, 2012 to shareholders of record as of November 16, 2012. Visa’s strong balance sheet and ample free cash balance allowed it to increase the quarterly dividend amount. The company believes in sharing its returns with shareholders to enhance shareholder value. Consequently, it has been increasing its dividend annually over the past four years.\nIn October 2011, Visa hiked its annual dividend by 47% to 88 cents per share from the prior dividend payout of 60 cents per share. Before that, in October 2010, the company increased its annual dividend by about 20% from the 2009 level, when it had raised the dividend by 19% over 2008.\nEarnings Precap\nVisa is scheduled to release its fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 on October 31 after the closing bell.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Visa’s fiscal fourth-quarter 2012 (ended September 30, 2012) earnings is currently pegged at $1.50 per share, up about 18% year over year. Of the 26 firms covering the stock, one revised the estimate upward while no downward revisions were witnessed in the past 30 days.\nFor fiscal 2012 (ended September 30, 2012), Visa’s earnings are expected to be $6.16 per share, which surged about 23% over 2011 level.\nVisa’s fiscal third-quarter 2012 (ended June 30, 2012) operating earnings of $1.56 per Class A common share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45. Additionally, the earnings substantially exceeded prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.26 per share, primarily based on lower share count.\nVisa, which competes withMasterCard Incorporated(MA), currently carries a Zacks #2 Rank, implying a Buy rating for the short term.

         "For Immediate Release Chicago, IL – October 29, 2012 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets.

Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the free Profit from the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=5513 Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog: Hess to Divest North Sea Fields U.S. energy company Hess Corporation ( HES ) entered into an agreement with Europe’s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A) to sell its interest in the Beryl area fields and the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation System. Shell will pay $525 million for this deal. The fields, which are located in the North Sea near Aberdeen, Scotland, are jointly operated by Hess Corp. with Apache Corporation ( APA ). During the first nine months of 2012, the Beryl field produced 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Shell’s current interest in the Beryl field yields 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Following the acquisition, the company plans to increase production to up to 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Shell’s interest in the fields will increase in a range of 9–65%.

         "Got Bitcoin? Probably not. AP Photo / Vahid Salemi After decades of sanctions on Iranian trade , sanctions restricting the flow of money in and out of Iran have inflicted significant damage on the Iranian economy. That owes much to the Belgium-based Society for Worldwide International Financial Transfers (SWIFT), which in March agreed to block any Iranian banks blacklisted by the European Union from using its international payment systems. Not long after the SWIFT cutoff, things started going rapidly downhill for the Iranian rial, suggesting that it has become much tougher for Iran to get hold of the hard currency it has used to prop up the rial. Now Bloomberg Businessweek has an interesting take on how a few Iranians are looking at using the anonymous electronic payment system Bitcoin to poke holes in the curtain of sanctions that separates the Iranian economy from most of the world. Iranian-American bitcoin consultant Farzhad Hashemi recently traveled to Tehran and talked up bitcoin to his friends. “They are instantly fascinated by it,” he says. “It’s a flash for them when they realize how it can solve their problems.” Iranians working or living abroad can send bitcoins to their families, who can use one of the online currency matchmaking services to find someone willing to exchange bitcoins for euros, rials, or dollars. Bitcoins are useful to Iranians wishing to move their money abroad, either to children studying in Europe or America or simply to stash cash in a safe place. Very useful—if you can use it. But that’s easier said than done for Iranians. As this report from Forbes outlines, software downloaded from US sites is subject to US export controls, and software that uses the kind of encryption Bitcoin does is banned from export to countries covered by sanctions. There are ways to get around the blockage, but you have to be pretty technically savvy: Other Bitcoin “experts” have alluded to alternative methods of downloading the Bitcoin client such as using non-U.S. independent mirrored sites, Virtual Private Network (VPN) for IP address masking, Tor if your country has an exit node, or BitTorrent file sharing. And more in the same vein. The short version: for most Iranians, Bitcoin isn’t a way out."

         "SMART INVESTOR: Women-Owned Hedge Funds Are Blowing Away The Competition",
         "No matter how you slice and dice the numbers, there's little that hedge funds have going for them these days. Last year was particularly brutal for the industry, which performed just 1.3 percent better than the S&P 500 and saw hundreds of offices shuttered as a result of poor returns. But there were at least a small fraction of firms that had something to smile about –– those owned by women. A new report by financial services firm Rothstein Kass shows female hedge fund managers netted an average 8.95 percent return in the third quarter of 2012, while the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index (released by Hedge Fund Research) showed a 2.69 percent net return through September. “Our report certainly displays the dichotomy facing women in the alternative investment industry,” said Kelly Easterling, principal-in-charge of Rothstein Kass’ Walnut Creek office. “We definitely see increased demand for women-owned and -managed funds from institutional investors, although the pace of investments is not as fast as many of the women we polled would hope.\" As investors, women have time and again proven they have one weapon in particular that sets them apart from the opposite sex: patience. “The fact that women-owned or managed hedge funds have been able to handily outperform their male counterparts is not particularly surprising,” said Meredith Jones, director at Rothstein Kass and author of the study. “There have been a number of studies that show women investors to be more risk adverse, and therefore potentially better able to escape market downturns and volatility. ” And yet, there's still a glaring imbalance between female and male leadership roles in the investment business –– with fewer than 20 percent of C-level positions at hedge funds filled by women. Women are even scarcer at venture capital and private equity firms, where they make up 13 percent and 12 percent of C-level desks, according to the index. The reason? Rothstein asked 366 senior-level women in the alternative investment industry for their points of view, and nearly half admitted their gender made it \"more difficult to succeed\" in the business. More specifically, in an industry where reputation and track record weigh so heavily on moving up, there aren't enough open positions for women to get their feet in the door. And it doesn't help that not many women grow up dreaming about working in finance. \"While there are signs of increased interest in women-owned and -managed alternative investment funds, the pace of asset flows, combined with the historical lack of supply of women in the industry, has not yet kicked off a revolution,\" said Jones. Still, there has arguably never been a better time for women to take the reins. Story continues \"It seems as if the right ingredients are in place,\" she added. \"Strong performance, generally positive investment outlook and emerging manager mandates ... there can be little doubt that women should become more commonplace in finance.\" SEE ALSO: These are the 10 worst mistakes individual investors can make > More From Business Insider Bitcoin Is Crashing HTML5 vs. Apps: Where The Debate Stands Now, And Why It Matters Here's Why I Have No Problem Traveling To 'Dangerous' Places For Women View comments"

They have opened up to new locations on the East Coast as well as added 58 new clients to their portfolio in Houston, TX. Even more impressive is that all this is happening when Groupon and LivingSocial just announced the firing of over 1200 employees, which is about 8.9% of their total workforce.\nWe spoke with BTC Marketing Director of Operations, Doug Ascher, about the keys to BTC Marketing Group's success over the last year. \"In all honesty, it's as simple as work ethic. Our team is the hardest working team in the business in my opinion,\" explains Doug Ascher. When we took an inside look at the company's day-to-day operations, we got a firsthand look at what Doug was talking about. BTC Marketing Group puts together packages for professional sports teams, high end spas, national restaurant chains, and more. BTC Marketing Group takes unused inventory and repackages it. Then takes those packages, and markets and sells them to the clients target market by going out and dealing with small and medium sized businesses that their clients are trying to attract. Essentially, it is what Doug Ascher calls a \"win, win, win\" strategy. \"For example, a sports team knows it won't fill all of its seats at the stadium, so rather than let them sit empty, they give us access to an allotted amount of tickets for certain games throughout the year. We take those tickets and develop a mini-season ticket package that we can market to the right target market. By giving the target market a huge discount for a great product, we help our client win by filling their seats, the customer wins because they get unbeatable deals that they can't get anywhere else, and we as a company win because we reap the profit,\" explains Doug Ascher.\nWhen seeing BTC Marketing Group operate in person, it is easy to see how they have had so much growth over the last year. We asked Doug why he thinks they are having so much success when places like Groupon are starting to struggle. \"Person to person marketing is, always was, and always will be the most effective marketing strategy. The positive is it is what we do best. The negative is that if a person is going to be successful with us, they have to have an unbelievable work ethic. And in today's world, work ethic is a characteristic that is slowly disappearing.\" Oh, and if you want to see a perfect example of the 'work ethic' that Doug is talking about, you don't need to look any further than Doug Ascher himself. A little over a year ago, Doug was hit by a car and suffered a traumatic brain injury. After months of hospital stays and rehab sessions, he is now back to leading his company from the front lines. When we asked him how he has been able to make such an amazing and quick comeback, he simply says, \"If I am going to ask my office team to give me 100% work ethic, then I have to be the first one out there leading from the front and doing it myself.\""

         "31% of Kenyas GDP is spent through mobile phones",
         "Pundits like to talk about how developing countries can leapfrog rich countries by skipping certain stages of developmentfor example, by going straight to an economy based on renewable energy without first passing through a phase of messy fossil-fuel based industrializationbut it rarely happens. M-Pesa, the system of mobile payments first launched in Kenya, is an exception . Begun in 2007 as a way to send people their microloans, M-Pesa has since become the countrys dominant method of sending remittances from workers in the city to relatives in Kenyas rural areas. Safaricom, the mobile telecommunications company that launched M-Pesa, has 19 million customers, which is nearly every adult in Kenya. Of those, 15 million use M-Pesa, which processes 80 transactions a second and handles transactions responsible for 31% of the $33.62 billion GDP of Kenya, reports the Financial Times (paywall). There are more than 700 million cell phones in Africa, and 70% of the population has one. Coincidentally, 70% of the population also has no access to a bank. The runaway success of M-Pesa can be attributed to the collision of these forces, though it hasnt been equally successful in every country in which its been introduced, notes Vanessa Clark at TechCrunch . For example, M-Pesa never took off in South Africa, possibly because banks there learned a lesson from what happened in Kenya and began offering similar mobile payment services before it even arrived. In South Africa, mobile payments are dominated by Fundamo, which was acquired by Visa in 2011 for $110 million and is now the basis of mobile payment systems being rolled out in India (where M-Pesa is also establishing a foothold ) and Rwanda. In the US and other rich countries, payments via cell phone are still languishing behind a tangle of standardsNear Field Communication, countless apps and various failed efforts at mobile wallets . In Africa, though, the lack of existing banking and other types of infrastructure have propelled many countries into the payments future that smartphones were supposed to enabledespite the fact that the overwhelming majority of phones in Africa remain low-end feature phones. More from Quartz Bitcoin is trading at a record high Filipinos like overseas relatives to deliver cash to their doors, and Mexicans prefer it in-store This heat map from Square shows how local commerce exploded around the Super Bowl"

         "Bank accounts are out, smartphones are in. In 2011, some 2.5 billion people in the world were “unbanked ” (pdf), as the lingo goes, according to the World Bank. By 2016, more people will have bank accounts, but in regions like the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, even more will have smartphones, research and consulting firm Analysys Mason predicts in a report today. As we’ve written before, the increasing availability of cheap smartphones in emerging markets is one of the most important consumer trends today. Smartphone penetration should reach 46% in Asia by 2017 from 23% in 2012, and 29% in the Middle East and North Africa from 7% last year. The International Data Corporation forecasts that 70% of all smartphones shipped will be destined for emerging markets by 2017. That quick growth means that smartphone owners should surpass bank-account holders by 2016 in most emerging Asian countries (Malaysia, China, Indonesia, Thailand, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh) as well as in the Middle East and North Africa, Analysys Mason estimates.

         "Kenyans and poor Americans have this in common: mobile banking",
         "We’ve reported on how people in emerging markets residents are opening bank accounts and paying for things with their mobile phones, transforming business in those countries. But the US Federal Reserve would like you to know (pdf) that the changes aren’t all in other parts of the world. Poor people in the US are some of the most avid users of mobile banking and mobile payment systems. In fact, they’re likely to be the first adopters. And when you look at why, it turns out to be for similar reasons to why people in emerging markets have embraced mobile banking and payments: a lack of access to traditional banking. Around 9.5% of Americans said they were completely “unbanked,” meaning they didn’t have a savings, checking, or money market account. (In Kenya, for comparison, the proportion is 70%.) Meanwhile, 10% are ”underbanked”—which the Fed defines as “people with bank accounts but who use check cashers, payday lenders, or payroll cards.” But despite being among the poorest, most of these people—59% of the unbanked, and 90% of the underbanked—have mobile phones, and around half of them are smartphones. And this makes them pretty different from the rest of the US: Of underbanked consumers with phones, 49% use mobile banking, versus just 28% of all people in the US with mobile phones. 30% of underbanked residents have used mobile payments in the last 12 months, compared to 15% of the total population of mobile phone users. Also intriguing is that the percentage of the population without a bank account is slowly declining, from 10.8% in 2011 to 9.5% in 2012. Whether that’s because prosperity is returning, banks are reaching more people, or mobile banking is encouraging more people to sign up for accounts, the Fed doesn’t say.

         "The recent decision by the government of Cyprus to shut down the island's banks and limit the amount depositors can withdraw from their accounts reveals just how real the country's financial woes are. Yet even as Cypriots are most keen to get their hands on cold, hard cash, some investors are placing their bets on the virtual currency known as bitcoin.%VIRTUAL-pullquote-Bitcoin in some senses is a financial island, operating at a safe distance from the traditional banking system.%Used primarily to buy goods and services online, bitcoin is a recent invention, created just four years ago by an Internet hacker (or group of hackers) known as Satoshi Nakamoto. AsBloomberg BusinessWeek notes, even by Web standards, bitcoin \"is a strange and supergeeky phenomenon.\"Bitcoins operate on a network that somewhat resembles a typical exchange on the capital markets. AsCNBC reports, buyers can exchange national currencies for bitcoins and use them wherever they are accepted, and sellers can exchange bitcoins for traditional national currencies.As the financial crisis has deepened in Cyprus, and holders of euros and Russian rubles become increasingly anxious, the value of the bitcoin has surged. AsABC News reports, the exchange rate for 1 bitcoin has soared to nearly $80 from $40 just two weeks ago.\nSponsored Links\nBitcoin is \"clearly having a breakthrough moment here, and a deeply surprising one given its novelty and nascent infrastructure,\" Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group, told the network.AsDailyFinance reported last year, bitcoin in some senses is a financial island, operating at a safe distance from the traditional banking system. It's neither controlled by central banks nor governments, and thus not vulnerable to larger-scale shifts like changing interest rates, nor the rampant inflation of countries in decline.It's that isolation from geopolitical turmoil that has been its true selling point for people in Europe.How does it work?

         "How to short bitcoins (if you really must)",
         "The rise of bitcoin, an electronic currency traded on an online exchange, has generated a media frenzy. Once scoffed at, its value has risen by 631% (denominated in dollars) since the start of 2013. Lots of people think that means were in a bitcoin bubble and it will eventually pop. But if youre one of these bitcoin bears, the company doesnt make it easy for you to short iti.e., bet that its value will go down. The usual way to short a currency is to use a currency pairsomething like EUR/USD, the value of a euro denominated in dollarswhich trades as a single unit. For example, if the euro was trading at $1.3000, you would borrow a currency pair from your broker, which you have to return within a certain period of time, and sell it on the open market, pocketing $1.30. If after an hour EUR/USD is trading at $1.2950, you can buy the currency pair at that price and return it to your broker, making a profit of $0.0050. (If youre wrong, you lose out.) Most of the exchanges which allow you to trade bitcoins, however, dont currently offer anything like currency pairs, nor any other futures or derivatives. Which means you would have to amass a stock of actual bitcoins to bet on them. That gets expensive. One day, if bitcoin becomes well established, institutional foreign exchange dealers could make markets in bitcoins. (Among the current obstacles: There are only 11 million bitcoins in existence, and there can never be more than 21 million, so its not a very liquid market. If a way ever emerges to break bitcoins up into small fractions, that might solve the problem.) But for those looking to short bitcoins right now, there are two notable ways to do it: Bitfinex : A Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange based in Hong Kong, Bitfinex allows ordinary bitcoin holders to act like brokers and lend bitcoins to people who want to trade them. The exchange does a lot of this automatically. ICBIT : ICBIT allows traders to make bets using futuresfinancial contracts in which a buyer agrees to buy a security, in this case a bitcoin, at a future date at a predetermined price. Futures contracts can be bought and sold, so you can make money without buying the actual bitcoins themselves. This platform will also let you trade commodities, such as oil, in bitcoins. Story continues Still, do you really want to short bitcoins? The market is still pretty volatile, and because its an unfamiliar mix of currency and equity, its likely to stay that way for a while. Remarks Cullen Roche, the founder of Orcam Financial Group, Youd probably be better off just going to Vegas though. Youll have more fun, about the same odds, and the drinks in the casino will be free. If youd like to make us aware of any other means of shorting bitcoin, please email sf@qz.com.
